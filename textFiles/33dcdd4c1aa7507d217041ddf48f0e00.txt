"Syntax tree" redirects here. For the trees used in linguistics, see Parse tree.

In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST), or just syntax tree, is a tree representation of the abstract (simplified) syntactic structure of source code written in a certain programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is abstract in the sense that it does not represent every detail that appears in the real syntax. For instance, grouping parentheses is implicit in the tree structure, and a syntactic construct such as if cond then expr may be denoted by a single node with two branches.
Abstract syntax trees are thus different from concrete syntax trees traditionally called parse trees, and are often built by the parser part of the source code translation and compiling process (despite a perhaps unintuitive naming). Once built, additional information is added to the AST by subsequent processing, e.g., semantic analysis.
