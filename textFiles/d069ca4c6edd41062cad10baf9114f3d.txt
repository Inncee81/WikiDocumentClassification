[edit] Overview
2ch was opened on May 30, 1999 in a college apartment in Conway, Arkansas, on the campus of University of Central Arkansas[10] by Hiroyuki Nishimura, known simply as "Hiroyuki" (ひろゆき)
The website's scale and management style are unique. It has more than 600 active boards (Japanese ita) such as "Social News", "Computers", and "Cooking", making it the most comprehensive forum in Japan. Each board usually has thousands of specific threads, such as "Coming election in Tokyo: 4th vote", "P4 vs. Athlon: overheating 51 times", and "Best wheat for making Pizza: 3rd slice"[citation needed].
2ch operates on innovative forum software which is a major departure from 1980s bulletin board systems or 1990s forum software such as vBulletin. Most importantly, nearly everything is done anonymously and voluntarily. A posting in a thread will either "age" (bump, from Japanese "ageru", to raise) or "sage" (not bump, from Japanese "sageru", to lower) its position in the thread list; "sage-ed" posts have no effect on its position. Threads may be "sage-ed" if the thread is disliked, or to keep it from cluttering the main thread list, or to prevent idle browsers from flooding in and trolling the thread at the top of the list.
Each thread is limited to 1000 postings at maximum, and a new thread must be opened (by some anonymous user, self-elected during discussion) to continue discussion. This prevents the rotting of old threads and keeps active topics refreshed. It also saves bandwidth, which is a major concern on a forum as large as 2ch. Old threads are moved to a paid archive, then eventually deleted.

[edit] Culture





The neutrality of this article is disputed. Please see the discussion on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved. (April 2008)






2ch-born characters. These Shift JIS arts are made by anonymous users and practically used as public domain.



[edit] Anonymous posting
One of the most distinctive features of 2ch is the complete freedom of anonymous posting. This is a large departure from most English language internet forums which require some form of registration, usually coupled with email verification for further identification of an individual. On 2ch, a name field is available but seldom used. Entering your name in the field, unless you do so with an obvious lack of purpose, would identify you as a newbie who doesn't understand the forum, an administrator, or someone attempting to be a Web celebrity.
The reason for allowing anonymous posting was given in an interview with the founder of 2ch in the Japan Media Review:

Q: Why did you decide to use perfect anonymity, not even requiring a user name?
A: Because delivering news without taking any risk is very important to us. There is a lot of information disclosure or secret news gathered on Channel 2. Few people would post that kind of information by taking a risk. Moreover, people can only truly discuss something when they don't know each other.
If there is a user ID attached to a user, a discussion tends to become a criticizing game. On the other hand, under the anonymous system, even though your opinion/information is criticized, you don't know with whom to be upset. Also with a user ID, those who participate in the site for a long time tend to have authority, and it becomes difficult for a user to disagree with them. Under a perfectly anonymous system, you can say, "it's boring," if it is actually boring. All information is treated equally; only an accurate argument will work.


[edit] Free speech
The only type of posts which are not allowed are vandalism posts (for example, spamming and flooding) and posts which could be classed as slander under Japanese law, and could result in legal action being undertaken against 2channel. Also, posts which declare intentions to commit a crime would be referred to the police, due to events such as the Neomugicha incident.
Incidents such as this have happened in the past, an example of this being a women's mahjong league and the activist Debito Arudou.[11] 2channel, due to its massive size and anonymous posting, is littered with slander and defamation against public figures and institutions. Though the site has a rule to delete such illegal posting, the scale of the site makes a prompt response difficult. There are numerous civil actions against Nishimura by individuals and corporations for slander and defamation. Nishimura so far ignored every court order and has never shown up for any trial and he has lost every civil case brought against him by default. Nishimura does not hold any sizable asset in Japan and any financial gain by Nishimura (bar what the court rule as necessary living expense) is subject to foreclosure. 2channel's assets are all held overseas; the servers are located in California and the domains are owned by a United States registrar. Moreover, technically, Nishimura does not own 2channel. None of the winners of civil action collected any money from Nishimura.
In January 2007, a small court in Japan, making a judgment on yet another slander case, announced that 2channel's holding company was bankrupt and it would be repossessed. This claim was openly mocked by Nishimura on 2channel's splash page, and nothing of the sort happened, although 2channel's Japanese ISP ended its operations.[12]

[edit] Participation
2ch members participate in various distributed computing projects such as the United Devices Cancer Research Project and SETI@home. 2ch is the current leader of the UD project, with the highest results and point total, as well as having the largest number of participants.[dated info]

[edit] Vocabulary
Main article: 2channel Shift JIS art
These terms are used both on 2channel and on its Japanese and American spinoffs.[13]

AA – Abbreviation of "ASCII art", usually referring to common Shift JIS art characters.
A-bone (Jp. あぼーん (abōn) ) – "To delete a post". Posts are deleted in two ways: Normal A-bone and invisible A-bone (Japanese 透明あぼーん). Any posts deleted as normal A-bone are replaced by a special post, whose subject, date, and body are all "あぼーん".
Age (pronounced "ah-geh") – From Japanese ageru (上げる "to raise"), refers to replying to an especially noteworthy or neglected post in order to move it to the top of the topic list (equivalent to the English bump)
Capcode – A special, custom tripcode used by website administrators and especially famous people chosen by the webmasters; in Japanese, simply "cap"(キャップ).
Fixed Handle – An online nickname (as opposed to anonymity); in Japanese, Kotehan(コテハン), from Kotei Handle Name(固定ハンドル)
Monā – An ASCII art character (whom the Mona Font is named after)
Giko Cat (Giko neko) – Another ASCII art character — the unofficial mascot of 2ch.
Off Kai – An offline meeting by anonymous posters
Sage (pronounced [sɑge]) – replying to a post using the word "sage" in the email field, which keeps it from bumping. In essence, the opposite of Age.
Tripcode – A cryptographic hash created from a password, used to allow a user to "sign" their posts while remaining anonymous; in Japanese, simply "trip" (トリップ,トリ　for short)
">>" – Often followed with the numeral of the intended post to mean reply or follow up. 2ch automatically makes a link.
>>1-san (>>1さん) – An ASCII art character, representing the poster who started the thread it appears in (equivalent to the English OP or Original Poster)


[edit] Common abbreviations and phrases

Burakura (ブラクラ) – "Browser crasher", one who posts links to sites designed to crash users' web browsers.
Chu or Chubou (厨房, lit:kitchen) – An intentional misuse of kanji for "中坊" (a middle school kid), it refers to those posters who post without reading any rules, also to those who engage in flaming and spamming. Its meaning is similar to the term internet troll.
Natsuchu (夏厨) – Someone who appears in the summer break and makes ridiculous posts, acting like Chu
DQN, or dokyun – Someone who is lacking common sense or seen as violent/unruly. A TV variety show called "Mokugeki! Dokyun"(目撃!ドキュン) introduced viewers to the lives of delinquents and dispensed various advice to them. The people featured on the show were seen as uneducated and prone to behavior lacking in common sense, which prompted the use of the show's name Dokyun (originally a word meaning the sound "bang") as a moniker for such undesirable people. The term was later sounded out and written as DQN.
Fuun (（　´_ゝ`）ﾌｰﾝ ) – a kaomoji for indifference; the word 「フーン」 is the Japanese equivalent of the English "meh." The fuun face is the basis of the Sasuga Brothers AA.
Fuyuchu (冬厨) – Similar to natsuchu, but for posters appearing in winter.
Haahaa ((*´Д`)ﾊｧﾊｧ) – a kaomoji indicating that one is breathing heavily. Generally due to being excited, in most cases connected to lust or sexuality, However, "Haahaa" does not imply masturbation or negative connotation by default. It may also indicate nervousness (for an example of the latter usage, see Densha Otoko).
Kami (神 or ネ申) – A person who is considered a "forum god" for especially useful posts or an interesting ID hash; see Kami
Kita!! (ｷﾀ━━━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━━━ !!!!!) – Literally, "I have/It has come!" it is generally used as a big exclamation mark (equivalent to the Japanese term yatta). The face in the center is named jisakujien.
ktkr An abbreviation of the previous kaomoji.
Kopipe (コピペ) – Copy/paste (copypasta in *chan). A text passage or piece of AA that is frequently recycled and reposted.
Nurupo (ぬるぽ) – A parody of the Java output "NullPointerException"(NullPointerException). Usually followed up with "GA(ガッ)!", the sound of a hammer hitting the "nurupo" poster, because of a meme started in this thread.
Tsuri (釣り) – Trolling; a calque of "trolling" as a method of fishing.
ｗ – A single letter substituting for "warau" or "laughing", added to mean that the poster is joking or thinks he made a funny remark, basically the equivalent to "LOL"; putting "ｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ" at the end of something is the same thing as saying "LOLOLOLOLOLOL". Additionally, this custom may have arose from the katakana 'ハ'. In katakana, 'Hahahaha' would be 'ハハハハ', which when condenced looks like condensed w's. 'Also warota (ワロタ) from the Kansai-ben past tense of warau. Warosu (ワロス) is one of the recent derivatives of warota, from the threads (ワロス　のガイドライン, Guidelines for warosu), where endless word-chanting of warosues is going on. Nowadays 'terawarosu' (ﾃﾗﾜﾛｽ) can be seen too. It means something like ROTFL.
orz (orz, OTZ, ○|￣|＿, OTL) – the image of someone bowing down in despair and hitting their head on the floor. The "o" is the head, the "r" is the hands and the body, the "z" the legs.
ki gasu (希ガス) – short for "ki ga suru" (I have a feeling that…(…のような気がする)). Given the intentionally misspelt kanji and katakana used here, this also means "noble gas."
moesu (ﾓｴｽ) – really really lovable. Moe is a term in Japanese that means something like "endearing"(萌える(可愛い)). On the flip side, kimosu (ｷﾓｽ) means "really creepy."(きもい。気持ち悪い) Anything with a ｽ at the end means ___sugi (way too ___).
more (漏れ) – an intentional misspelling of the very masculine first person pronoun ore(俺).
Nenchaku otsu (粘着乙(粘着、お疲れ様です)) – Someone who revives old threads or topics, or sticks to one topic too long, and it bothers the poster. Is meant to be rude. See "otsu" below.
kwsk (kwsk) – an abbreviation for "kuwashiku,"(詳しく) or "Detail it.". Specifically, a request for more details, or a source of the referenced information or manga. (similar to 4chan's "sauce")
otsu (乙) – an abbreviation for "otsukaresama"(お疲れ様), which is literally consisted of the honorific "o" + "tsukare" (meaning "fatigue") + "sama" (a polite title given to every adult, especially in correspondence). But in this particular instance, it roughly means "well done" or "thanks for your trouble" in an utterly ironic or sarcastic tone. For instance >>1乙. "Otsukaresama(desu)" is also a highly popular parting salute among office workers (both male and female), who use it instead of "sayonara."
wktk (wktk) - an abbreviation for "wakuteka" (ワクテカ), itself an abbreviation for "waku waku teka teka" (わくわくてかてか), which is (often ironically) used to express the fact that one "just can't wait" for something to happen.
(ry ((ry) - an abbreviation for "ika ryaku" (以下略), meaning that the end of a commonplace statement has been voluntarily omitted. Somewhat equivalent to "(you/we all know what I mean)", "[...]", "yadda yadda" or "blah blah blah".


[edit] English spinoffs

4-ch, is a primarily English anonymous forum powered by Kareha, message board software that follows the style of 2ch.
4chan BBS, once a separate site but now merged with 4chan. The forum layout is slightly different from 2ch, but the anonymous element remains the same.

Many imageboards also provide a select number of anonymous discussion boards.

[edit] Referral system
2channel uses a referral system for any links to external websites posted on the forum. People clicking on a link are first sent to a page filled with advertisements on the ime.nu domain where a link to the actual site is placed. Apart from collecting revenue from the 2channel visitors it also attracts website owners of the linked pages who check their statistics and can't link it back to 2channel[14].
Users will often attempt to bypass this system by removing the h from http in URLs, encouraging others to copy and paste the link, thus avoiding the referral page. For example, http://ja.wikipedia.org/ would become ttp://ja.wikipedia.org/.

[edit] 2ch phenomena

[edit] Densha Otoko
Main article: Densha Otoko
Between March and May 2004, an anonymous user posted in a sub-forum for single men to decry his woes. His post detailed an event that had happened that day as he was riding the train. According to his account, he was sitting on the train when he noticed an attractive woman. Suddenly, a drunken man entered the car and bothered many passengers, who did not offer any resistance to his disturbance. This man then began to sexually harass the woman, and seeing no-one else coming to her aid, the poster told the man to stop bothering the woman. The two struggled for a short time while the other passengers used this distraction to call the conductor, who took control of the situation.[1]
This poster was an extremely introverted, socially inept otaku. Never having done such a thing before in his life, he was amazed to find that the woman was thanking him deeply for saving her from harassment. They exchanged addresses and parted ways. The poster, upon returning home, began talking with other posters in the thread and was nicknamed "Densha Otoko" ("Train Man") for his bravery.
A bit later, Densha received a package from the woman he had saved. This package, originally thought to be a generic thank-you gift, turned out to be an expensive tea set. Flabbergasted, he turned to the 2channelers for advice: he was convinced that such a gift was too expensive to be a mere thank-you gift. Densha then contacted the woman and began meeting her regularly, all the while posting updates on 2ch and discussing the matter with other posters. Following their collective advice, he got a haircut, purchased new clothes, and began to come out of his shell. After seeing her for a while, his personality had changed and this culminated a few months later in Densha confessing his love for the woman. She accepted and when the 2channelers were informed of this there was a mass celebration; posts began flowing in congratulating the new couple.[2]
Because 2ch has an enormous impact on net culture in Japan, this story quickly spread throughout the media and became an instant hit. Its almost fairytale-like simplicity and emotional power drew people to the story, and a copy of the original threads relating to the story was published in a book. Since then, there have been four manga adaptations of the story; a feature film which reached #1 in the box office upon its release; and a hugely popular TV live-action drama aired during 2005. According to Densha Otoko and Hermes (the nickname of the woman; named after the brand of the tea-set she sent him), they are still together[dubious – discuss].

[edit] Masashi Tashiro
In 2001, 2ch users voted en-masse for Japanese TV performer Masashi Tashiro as Time Magazine's Person of the Year. This act was soon dubbed the "Tashiro Festival" (Tashiro Matsuri, 田代祭) by 2ch users. Tashiro was infamous in the Japanese media for committing several crimes, including peeping up a woman's skirt using a camcorder, using stimulants twice, peeping in a male bath and causing a car accident. 2ch programmers developed many scripts with whimsical names like the "Tashiro Cannon" (Tashiro-hō, 田代砲), "Mega particle Tashiro Cannon" (Mega-ryūshi Tashiro-hō, メガ粒子田代砲), "25-round Automatic Tashiro Cannon" (Nijū-go renda Tashiro-hō, 25連打田代砲) and the "Super Tashiro Cannon" (Chō Tashiro-hō, 超田代砲) for sending automated repeating votes. The "Super Tashiro Cannon" was so powerful it crashed Time's server. (The next script, the "Satellite Cannon -Tashiro-" was developed, but never used.) Due to the votes of 2ch users, he got to the No. 1 position temporarily on December 21, 2001. However, Time's staff realized that something was unusual, and Tashiro was removed as a candidate.[10]

[edit] IRC@2ch
There's also an IRC network called 'IRC@2ch', whose main IRC and web server are both hosted on irc.2ch.net. The network is rather small with three servers, no services, and fewer than 2000 users.[15] The chat in most channels is in Japanese, using the ISO-2022-JP encoding. The network maintains a list over what channels are currently the most active on its web page.
