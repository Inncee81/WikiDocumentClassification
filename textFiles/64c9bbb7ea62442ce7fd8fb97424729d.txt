The son of a U.S. Air Force officer, Bill graduated in 1961 from Yamato High School in Japan, and enlisted in the U.S. Air force. He was honorably discharged in 1965, and enlisted in the U.S. Navy in December of that year. He served in Vietnam, rising to the rank of petty officer.

[edit] The Secret Government
Cooper's earliest notoriety developed among UFO enthusiasts, as he promoted UFO conspiracy theories, Kennedy assassination theories, and theories about a New World Order.
In many ways, his accounts were similar to earlier UFO reports: UFOs had crashed, the ships and their alien pilots had been recovered, and the government made agreements with aliens. Cooper further detailed his arguments in a self-published pamphlet, "The Secret Government: The Origin, Identity and Purpose of MJ-12".[2]
The pamphlet contains multiple claims: UFOs had been crashing on Earth by the dozens since the mid-1940s, and Secretary of Defense James Forrestal threatened to publicize the fact and was killed to prevent him from doing so; in 1954 "His Omnipotent Highness Krlll"—leader of a species living on a planet orbiting Betelgeuse—appeared on earth and suggested a treaty: The aliens would abduct humans and wipe their memories of the event in exchange for sharing their technology. U.S. officials feared the aliens' superior technology, and felt they had no choice but to accept the conditions offered by the aliens.
Aliens quickly broke the treaty, kidnapping and killing humans and livestock. The Cold War, Cooper says, was largely a façade in that the United States and the Soviet Union were actually in close collaboration, both to combat the aliens and to pave the way for a totalitarian one world government. The Majestic 12 committee began selling drugs to raise funds to combat the aliens, reports Cooper, and President John F. Kennedy was assassinated when he objected. Cooper also notes that the alien threat could be a carefully crafted hoax and notes that these reports could also be top secret government aircraft.

[edit] Behold a Pale Horse
Many ufologists striving for mainstream acceptance ignored Cooper, yet he became a popular speaker on the UFO lecture circuit, and expanded his account into the book Behold a Pale Horse.
Cooper is perhaps best known for this 1991 book which details many of his claims about various conspiracy theories. The title is from the Bible, Revelation 6:8: "And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him." The book includes the text of The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Cooper placed a notice at the beginning of the chapter claiming that the Protocols are not Jewish in origin but were disguised as such.
Written after Cooper had been a member of the US Naval Intelligence Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, Behold a Pale Horse details Cooper's claims about the influence of UFOs on the US government, the New World Order, the assassination of President Kennedy, and the Apollo Moon landing.
Cooper later stated that he had been deceived by superiors into believing the UFO conspiracy. In a paper available at his website (hourofthetime.com) called MAJESTYTWELVE he stated:



When I saw Operation Majority while serving in the Navy I believed the alien threat was real just like everyone else. It was not until I had performed many years of research that I was able to fully understand exactly what it was that I had seen. It was extremely difficult for me to believe that my government and the United States Navy had used me, especially since I had dedicated my life to government and military service. Most government and military personnel cannot and will not believe such and [sic] idea.[3]




[edit] Radio host, author and political activist
Cooper was also a radio host, author and political activist known for his best-selling underground book titled Behold A Pale Horse and his worldwide shortwave radio show Hour of the Time. Cooper was also known for his court battle with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the recorded attempts to dissuade him from pursuing his case.[citation needed] He and Wayne Bentson co-researched the related CAJI News Service brief titled BATF/IRS -- Criminal Fraud[4] where he did a history of crimes committed by the Internal Revenue Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Department of the Treasury. The article was first published in Veritas magazine, issue #6, from September 1995. In the article, he asserts that the IRS is actually the same organization as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
He claimed that a Form 1040 is the income tax return for a nonresident alien citizen of the U.S. Virgin Islands residing within one of the 50 States of the Union known as the United States of America. He also claimed that in Internal Revenue Service publication 6209 - Computer Codes for IRS, TC 150 is the code for Virgin Island returns and codes 300 through 398 are "U.S. and UK Tax Treaty claims involving taxes on narcotics which were financed in the Cayman Islands and imported into the Virgin Islands." Cooper supposedly filed Freedom of Information Act requests for the IRS's Individual Master File of people experiencing tax problems and every return was found to contain those codes, except those coded as Guam returns. It is his assertion that "the Citizen is being taxed on income derived from importing narcotics, alcohol, tobacco, or firearms into the United States, or one of its territories or possessions, from a foreign country, or from Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or into the Virgin Islands from the Cayman Islands."[4]
He had also produced several documentaries covering subjects such as the John F. Kennedy assassination and government 'black projects'.
Cooper's detractors labeled him a conspiracy theorist because of his publications, a charge Cooper did not deny, arguing this:

Investigation of the alleged Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has disclosed a broad, premeditated conspiracy to defraud the Citizens of the United States of America. Examination of the United States Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, the Statutes at Large, Congressional Record, the Federal Register, and Internal Revenue manuals too numerous to list, reveals a crime of such magnitude that words cannot adequately describe the betrayal of the American people. What we uncovered has clearly been designed to circumvent the limitations of the Constitution for the United States of America and to implement the Communist Manifesto within the 50 States. Marx and Engels claimed that, in the effort to create a classless society, a "graduated income tax" could be used as a weapon to destroy the middle class. [ . . . ] Through the clever use of language, the government promotes the fraud.[5]

Throughout the late 1980s, Cooper was a controversial figure in the UFO research community. For the most part, he followed many of the claims of John Lear, specifically, that the government of the United States has had contact and has entered into a bargain with an extraterrestrial society and that those ETs were responsible for abductions. He circulated materials on Usenet as well as the old Paranet BBS. Notable among them was a Petition to Indict those involved with the UFO cover-up. His UFO beliefs of the time are well described in Behold a Pale Horse.
In later years, Cooper recanted his UFO-oriented beliefs, asserting that they were in fact part of the Illuminati plot to subjugate the United States.[citation needed]
William Cooper founded Harvest Trust, the CAJI News Service, Veritas newspaper, The Intelligence Service, and Harvest Publications. Under his leadership Harvest Trust ventured into publishing. The first book under the Harvest Trust imprint was Oklahoma City: Day One (ISBN 0-9653307-1-0), by Michele Marie Moore about the Oklahoma City bombing. In 1998 Veritas and Harvest Publications was sold to Hallmark Creative Corporation along with the copyright and all rights to all written material produced or ever to be produced by William Cooper including Behold A Pale Horse and Oklahoma City: Day One. Hallmark Creative Corporation has contracted to ensure this material is always available to the public.[6]
An advocate for free radio, Cooper operated the unlicensed Independence Foundation Trust at 101.1 FM in Eagar, Arizona. Cooper claimed to have helped over 700 low power FM affiliate stations get equipped and on the air.

[edit] Later life
Shortly after the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Rush Limbaugh read a White House memo on the air during his broadcast which named William Cooper, ". . . the most dangerous radio host in America". Mr. Cooper considered President Bill Clinton's pronouncement the greatest compliment that he had ever received.[6]
Cooper was charged with various crimes, including tax evasion from 1992 to 1994, and bank fraud for giving false information on a loan application. He was never convicted of any of these charges.[citation needed]
In the 1990s Cooper's interest moved from UFOs, to covert government programs, and finally to the militia movement.

[edit] Death
By 1998 Cooper was living in Arizona. There was a warrant for his arrest due to claims by a local doctor that Cooper made threatening actions when the doctor was loitering near Cooper's home. Cooper said he would meet with armed resistance any attempt to execute what he saw as "unlawful warrants." Later a warrant was issued for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, following a dispute with a local man who was stalking Cooper.[7] According to Commander X, in March 1999 Cooper sent his family out of the United States for their security. He lived and worked alone with his two dogs, one rooster, and one chicken until his death in 2001.[8] In July and September 2001, Cooper was accused of using a handgun to threaten a loiterer near his home in Eagar, Arizona.
On November 5, 2001, officers of the Apache County Sheriff's Office decided to serve Cooper a warrant based on the above-mentioned charges. For reasons not explained,[citation needed]the Sheriff's Office sent deputies to Cooper's home at approximately 11:00PM, and instead of knocking on his door and announcing themselves, the deputies attempted to lure Cooper from his house by posing as citizens playing loud music on or near his property. Cooper, who was an above the knee amputee, went down to investigate the scene in his truck. It is disputed whether the deputies identified themselves or tried to serve an arrest warrant at that time. Nevertheless, Cooper announced he was returning to his house to contact the Eager Police Department, either to verify the warrant or to contact the local authorities in order to report what he may have still believed was a real disturbance. Before he could do so however, the sheriff's deputies tried to apprehend him, at which point shooting began. Although it is unclear who began firing, there are some who question the uncertain circumstances, and who was responsible for first shots fired. Cooper was armed and one deputy was wounded. Another deputy returned fire, killing Cooper.[9] Milton William Cooper was 58 years old.
