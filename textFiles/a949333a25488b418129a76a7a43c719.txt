[edit] Premise
The series revolved around Angus MacGyver (known to his friends as MacGyver or "Mac") who favors brain over brawn in order to solve desperate problems. MacGyver's main asset is his practical application of scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items—along with his ever-present Swiss Army knife. The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly intractable problems—often in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices in a matter of minutes—were a major attraction of the show, which was praised for generating interest in the applied sciences, and particularly engineering,[1] as well as providing entertaining story lines. All of MacGyver's exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted to be based on real scientific principles (even though, the creators acknowledged, in real life one would have to be extraordinarily lucky for most of MacGyver's ideas to succeed). In the few cases where MacGyver used household chemicals to create poisons, explosives or other things deemed too dangerous to be accurately described for public consumption, details were intentionally altered or left vague.[2]
The use of ordinary household items to jury rig devices shows an influence from The A-Team (though MacGyver eschewed firearms). The idea has entered United States popular culture; such constructions are referred to as "MacGyverisms" (a term first used in episode 3 of season 2, "Twice Stung"). The name has also become a verb, as in "The car broke down but he MacGyvered a fix to get home".
The show often dealt with social issues, though more so in Seasons 4-7, versus Season 1-3, which were mostly about MacGyver's adventures working for the United States government, and then later the Phoenix Foundation.
In 2003, the WB had a pilot for a possible new Young MacGyver series starring Jared Padalecki as MacGyver's newphew Clay, but opted to pass on the series instead.[3]
In an August 2007 survey commissioned by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, Americans polled voted MacGyver as the favorite fictional hero they would want to have if they were ever caught in an emergency.[4]

[edit] Format
Several episodes began with a cold open, finding MacGyver already on a mission. MacGyver often narrated himself with a story from his childhood that was somehow analogous to his current situation. MacGyver resolves his current situation quickly and the main story commences after the opening credits. This opening sequence is called in the credits the "Opening Gambit". This segment is often written and directed by a different team than the main story of the episode. After the credits, the main story plays out in standard three act structure. In many episodes, the opening sequence occurs after the opening credits and often does not involve MacGyver on a mission, but rather in a situation used for character development. In the same manner as the "Opening Gambit" sequences, these opening segments often do not directly relate to the main story.

[edit] Cast and characters




Richard Dean Anderson as MacGyver


MacGyver's producers had a tendency to use an actor in multiple roles throughout the series. Several recurring characters were also added throughout the series run, appearing as guest stars in the opening credits. 
[edit] Main characters

Richard Dean Anderson as Angus MacGyver: MacGyver is a highly intelligent, optimistic action hero who prefers non-violent conflict resolution wherever possible. He refuses to carry or use a gun due to a childhood accident with a revolver that resulted in the death of a friend.[5] The character is portrayed as an outspoken advocate of gun control, as well as a supporter of environmental preservation, racial equality and assisting the poor. Even in cases where his improvised devices are used to attack hostile opponents, he is always doing so in self-defense and, if possible, subduing or disabling rather than killing. He is often suspicious of militaristic attitudes within the government; he sees his Phoenix Foundation employer as an alternative to the more conventional (and violent) means of law enforcement.


Dana Elcar as Pete Thornton: MacGyver's boss and best friend, Pete is an operative at the Department of External Services (DXS) which is where he is impressed by Mac's ingenuity while tracking down Murdoc, an international assassin. When Pete takes the position of Director of Operations at the Phoenix Foundation several years later, he brings MacGyver into the program. In addition to sending Mac out on various task for the Foundation, Pete is many times forced to bail MacGyver out of the trouble he gets into. Pete has a son named Michael. Dana Elcar first appeared as the chief of operations for KIVA laboratories under a different character name, Andy Colson.[6] Elcar returns later in the first season to play the recurring Thornton character.[7] During the show's run, Elcar began going blind as a result of glaucoma. This condition was eventually written into the Thornton character, as well.[8]


[edit] Recurring characters

Bruce McGill as Jack Dalton: An aviator and old friend of MacGyver's with a weakness for get-rich-quick schemes that invariably get both of them into trouble. He always wears a peaked cap and twitches his left eye when lying.


Michael Des Barres as Murdoc: MacGyver's most frequent opponent, a master assassin who never fails—except when MacGyver gets involved. Murdoc is a master of disguise, as well as highly skilled and creative in the use of booby traps. Murdoc's signature for each hit is to take photographs of his victims at the moment of their deaths. His first appearance in the series is presented as his second run-in with MacGyver. Murdoc returns for revenge for their first encounter—to the surprise of MacGyver, as Murdoc had apparently been killed. Murdoc's revenge scheme not only fails, but results in him apparently being killed again. This became a recurring theme: each of Murdoc's subsequent appearances ends in another apparently certain "death", which he incredibly survives, to return in a later episode.


Teri Hatcher as Penny Parker:[9][10][11] Penny Parker and MacGyver meet in line at an airport in Bulgaria when she tries to smuggle some jewels out of the country in his pocket.[12] With little talent, but big dreams, her pursuit of a show business career gets her into trouble more than once; she was once used by Murdoc as an unwitting pawn in an attempt to eliminate MacGyver. She was also the spitting image of her late aunt Betty Parker, who was murdered in 1958 by her boyfriend, and was suffering from lead poisoning.[13] In a drinking game, players watching the show are to have one drink for every time "Penny Parker gets MacGyver in trouble."[14]


Della Reese, Cleavon Little, Richard Lawson, and Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Coltons: A family of bounty hunters (Mama Colton, Frank, Jesse and Billy), introduced one at a time—the only episode in which more than one appears is their collective final appearance in the final season, on which occasion they took over the episode entirely, relegating MacGyver to a cameo appearance. This episode, called "The Coltons", was actually intended as a pilot for a spin-off starring the Coltons,[15] but ABC network officials decided it would not be aired.[16]


John Anderson as Harry Jackson: Harry Jackson, MacGyver's grandfather, helped raise MacGyver after his grandmother and father were killed in a car accident. A few years later, he left MacGyver. After another eighteen years, Harry and MacGyver meet again in the season one episode, "Target MacGyver", in which MacGyver and his grandfather work together to defeat an assassin named Axminster (D'Mitch Davis). Harry dies of a heart attack in the fifth season finale episode "Passages".


Elyssa Davalos as Nikki Carpenter:[17][18] Nikki Carpenter joins the Phoenix Foundation in the third season. She often has differences of opinion with MacGyver, although the two eventually come to respect each other as professionals.


Brigitta Stenberg as Maria Romburg: Brigitta appears in the sixth season initially to scam a friend of MacGyver's. She changes sides, joins the Phoenix Foundation and becomes a love interest of MacGyver.


Michele Chan as Mei Jan: Initially calling herself Sue Ling, the name of MacGyver's foster daughter, Mei Jan enlists MacGyver's help in completing her mission for the Chinese student movement. She later reveals that the real Sue Ling was killed in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[19]


Dalton James as Sean Angus Malloy: Sean, known as Sam, is introduced in the series finale as MacGyver's son with a past love named Kate Malloy. Sean's middle name is a dedication by his mother to his father.


Roxanne Reese as Cynthia Wilson: Introduced with her husband Booker (Michael D. Roberts) in "The Challenge", Cynthia runs the Challenger's Club, a program for troubled inner-city teens. In episodes where MacGyver tries to help runaways or other youths, he invariably sends them to the Challenger's Club as a safe haven.


Mayim Bialik as Lisa Woodman: She is a young girl who MacGyver originally meets at a Swiss boarding school in the episode "Cease Fire", where she accidentally loses his trusty Swiss Army knife. She later returns in two more episodes, "Hearts of Steel" and "Twenty Questions", the latter involving Mac helping her overcome an alcohol abuse problem.


Kimberly Scott as Mama Lorraine: She appears in only the final season of MacGyver. Mama Lorraine is a voodoo priestess. She appears in episodes "The 'Hood", "The Prometheus Syndrome" and "Walking Dead".


[edit] Organizations in MacGyver

[edit] Department of External Services
The DXS is a U.S. intelligence agency where MacGyver and Peter Thornton are employed during the first season. It is revealed that MacGyver had been working there since 1979, when he was recruited by Pete.[20] At the beginning of Season 2, both of them leave for the Phoenix Foundation, but DXS agents still reappear throughout the series, sometimes as allies and sometimes as antagonists. While in their employ, MacGyver was usually sent overseas to rescue Americans in danger, locate or destroy sensitive equipment, or ordinary intelligence-gathering operations; however, other sections of the DXS are much more susceptible to corruption and have been seen trying to kidnap foreign heads of state[21] or interfering with democratic elections,[22] among other things.

[edit] Phoenix Foundation
A non-profit think tank and government contractor which employs Peter Thornton (as Director of Field Operations) and MacGyver (as field agent and "troubleshooter") in Seasons 2 through 7. It often cooperates with government agencies, particularly the police or intelligence community (since as MacGyver puts it, "we don't have to cut through as much red tape").[23] However it also does a great deal of work on its own; environmental surveys and clean-up operations, anti-drug initiatives, social programs, etc. The Phoenix Foundation is described as a "corporate white knight,"[24] an entity which is trusted and respected by the general public for its integrity. One of the organization's main aims during the 1980s and early 1990s was the expansion and furthering of new technologies within the United States, particularly personal computers, applied biosciences, and other socially responsible uses of technology.
Another aspect of operations for the Phoenix Foundation was sub-contracting to Police departments for crime scene investigation and forensic research, at a saving to both departments and local government. Services delivered include scan and backup of sensitive documents and other information, associative database face recognition with graphical interfaces for criminal identification, fingerprint dermatoglyph computer database assembly and search services. The Foundation initally provided terminal services (TTY and IBM 3460 Emulation) to police departments through early IBM-PC's to their central mainframe, and later provided early Internet services to the same departments at the introduction of the PS/2.
The Phoenix Foundation was an early proponent of responsible genetic engineering, going so far as to shut down programs of a number of different scientists in their employ where research and development work had resulted or could potentially result in harm outside of the laboratory. The Foundation had equal scruples when dealing with other projects, always erring on the side of caution and wary of causing harm. In most cases field operatives were instrumental, and in the period of his employ, Angus MacGyver was perhaps the greatest.

[edit] Homicide International Trust
Appropriately shorthanded to "HIT," they are an international fraternity of assassins, employing killers from around the world to carry out their contracts. Murdoc was employed by them until he tried to retire; the organization reacted by putting a hit on him, forcing him to ask for MacGyver's help in order to save himself and his sister. He later tries to rejoin their ranks, and is rejected when he tries and fails to kill MacGyver (again).

[edit] Challengers' Club
A club that provides shelter for inner-city kids in need of help (recovering drug addicts, former prostitutes, orphans). It was founded by Booker and Cynthia Wilson, and is now run solely by Cynthia (after her husband was killed by a neighborhood racist). MacGyver is often involved with them and will sometimes use his connections in the Phoenix Foundation to secure funding or other forms of help.

[edit] MacGyver's gear

MacGyver's Swiss Army Knife was constantly changing throughout the series. He most often used the Tinker (and/or Tinker Small) and a Huntsman model from Victorinox.[25] A few times he uses an Orange Peeler blade, found on the Victorinox Executive.
Another peculiarity is the appearance of the 111 mm series from Victorinox, a larger size knife. It appeared in a few Episodes between "Runners" and "The Ten Percent Solution." It was used for rather brutal tasks, such as chiseling ice twice and being hammered through a door with a rock.
In addition to his Swiss Army Knife, MacGyver often carried a roll of duct tape in his back pocket, flattened out to make it fit. Other items he often seemed to have on hand were: an ID card, a watch, strike-anywhere matches, a handkerchief, a paper clip, wire, fishing line, a flashlight, and lock picks. The duct tape in one episode was Shurtape brand, as can be seen printed inside the roll.[26] His watch was a Timex Camper for most of the series, with a black and silver chronograph watch appearing on his wrist towards the end. It was shown that he also carried a toolbox in his Jeep.[27]

[edit] Vehicles
MacGyver drove a Jeep Chief Cherokee for the first part of the first season, which quickly changed to the Wrangler for the first half of the series, California license plate 1RJQ104. The last half saw him first driving a 1946 Chevy truck, and finally a 57 Nomad he inherited from his grandfather. For the final season, we see the brief return of the Jeep Wrangler. At different points in the series, he commandeered several exotic vehicles such as a Camaro Z-28 and a Ferrari 308. During a visit to Arkansas, he chose a Mustang convertible as his rental vehicle. He was also an able pilot, but usually left the task to Jack Dalton or other pilots.

[edit] Influence on culture

[edit] MacGyverisms
MacGyver employs his resourcefulness and his knowledge of chemistry, physics,[2] technology, and outdoorsmanship to resolve what are often life-or-death crises. He creates inventions from simple items to solve these problems. These inventions became synonymous with the character and were called MacGyverisms by fans.[28] MacGyver was unlike secret agents in other television series and films because, instead of relying on high-tech weapons and tools, he carried only a Swiss Army knife and duct tape.[2]
This also led to the verb, 'to MacGyver' or 'to MacGyver-ize' (the latter being introduced by Gregory Shockley in his training manuscripts published for the Boy Scouts of America). This word was used in Richard Dean Anderson's project Stargate SG-1.
'MacGyverism' was first used by Joanne Remmings (played by Pamela Bowen) in the third episode of Season 2. When MacGyver introduces himself to her, she uses the term in a manner that suggests other people had used it before:[29]

Oh I've heard about you! You're the guy who does the whatchamacallits, you know, MacGyverisms; turns one thing into another?

The show's writers based MacGyver's inventions on items they found on location, concepts from scientific advisors John Koivula and Jim Green, and real events.[2] The show also offered a monetary prize to people who sent good ideas in to the show. A young fan of the series suggested that MacGyver could patch up a vehicle's radiator by cracking an egg into the radiator. The episode "Bushmaster" was constructed around this trick, and the fan was rewarded. Although staff were appointed to read every letter sent in, few usable ideas were obtained in this way.[28]
Children watching the series imitated MacGyver and tried to replicate the simple devices he created in the show. The creative team behind MacGyver made a point of leaving out crucial elements of the inventions so that children would not be harmed.[2]
An important aspect of all MacGyverisms so far encountered has been the originator's reticence regarding their effectiveness - though most are effective in achieving their aims, many are not, and MacGyver himself when queried mid-process will often respond that his plan "May not work". That so many do is testament to his background and experience.

[edit] Saturday Night Live parody - MacGruber
Main article: MacGruber
In 2007, the NBC sketch show Saturday Night Live featured a parody of MacGyver called "MacGruber" with Will Forte as the title character. The intros for these skits featured scenes from the MacGyver series. MacGruber and cohorts are always locked in a control room of some type with a bomb set to go off in 15-20 seconds. MacGruber has his costars hand him components to defuse the device, but something inevitably gets in the way (either situational, because MacGruber himself interferes, or because no one wants to touch what he has asked for) and the bomb detonates.

[edit] In the media
In 2006, Anderson appeared in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. The spot poked fun at the character's ability to use everyday objects to perform extraordinary feats: In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zipline, and somehow repairs and hotwires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making somewhat extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is here portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how Mac seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial clearly indicates Anderson is portraying the role of MacGyver, he is never explicitly identified as such, possibly due to licensing issues related to the character.
The series is referenced in many episodes of The Simpsons, primarily detailing Marge Simpson's sisters Patty and Selma's obsession with the show and their crush on the MacGyver character. The sisters' regular viewing of the show is an unalterable element of their daily schedule to the point of death as demonstrated in the episode "Black Widower." The episode featured a fictional scene of MacGyver where he downplays his role in saving a village ("Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull").[30] In another episode, "A Star is Burns," Homer tricks Jay Sherman into insulting MacGyver in front of Patty and Selma; Sherman ends up being hung from the rain gutter by his underpants, and Bart asks "You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?" Anderson himself is an avid fan of The Simpsons, and even provided his voice for an episode of the show titled "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore", which first aired April 6, 2006.
In the Beavis and Butt-head episode, "Citizen Butt-Head" (1993), the pair are abruptly confronted by a member of the Secret Service, to which Beavis says, "Look, it's MacGyver!"
In the 1995 film Mallrats, the MacGyver character is referenced by Jay when he describes his friend Silent Bob's mechanical talents by saying "Motherfucker's like MacGyver...no, motherfucker's better than MacGyver!!"
In the 1996 film My Fellow Americans, Former President Matt Douglas (played by James Garner) quips, "Who am I, fuckin' MacGyver? I'm making this up as I go along!" as he and Former President Russell Kramer (played by Jack Lemmon) attempt to escape from a disgruntled NSA agent.
In the season one episode titled "Brian: Portrait of a Dog" from Family Guy, Peter writes a letter to Richard Dean Anderson asking him to save his dog using the enclosed items from the envelope: a rubber band, a paper clip and a straw. Anderson puts these together and hits himself in the eye with the rubber band.
The New Zealand sporting skit show Pulp Sport had a running gag called "McIvor" in which the MacGyver theme is played, and a prank involving Sky TV sports presenter Steven McIvor is played out. This gag, instead, now targets TV3 sports news presenter Hamish McKay (dubbed "McKay-ver"). The pranks usually involve the office area (a mobile phone taped to the under side of a desk) or something happening to the car of the victim (placing a goat in the back seat).
G4 aired a small series of MacGyver parodies about a young corporate cubicle worker known as MacGunner. He would construct ridiculous items out of cubicle materials, such as several dozen markers hooked end to end in order to reach over to his arch-enemy's cubicle and type a scathing email to the boss.
In Stargate SG-1, Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) referenced the series when she said "it took us fifteen years and three supercomputers to MacGyver a system for the gate on Earth." (SG1: "Children of the Gods" 1997)
In Stargate Atlantis, Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) also mentioned MacGyver when he was asked to fix a ship that he considered damaged beyond repair. (ATL: "Condemned" 2005)
On July 2, 2008, Randall Munroe's xkcd comic depicted a potentially lazy MacGyver.[31]
In the song The Million Dead by the British band of the same name MacGyver is killed after being mugged by a group of kids. Some MacGyverisms are also referenced but MacGyver is unable to help himself and dies as a result of the attack.
In 2008 the "What would MacGyver do?" phrase was used in a New Zealand television commercial for Gregg's "freestyle cooking" range of herbs and spices. The commercial featured the word MacGyver unfolding like a puzzle with a potato peeler and chopping knife opening out like the blades of a Swiss Army Knife.[32]
In 2008 the TV show Chuck made reference to one of MacGyver's devices that he used to cut through a pair of handcuffs. After Chuck cut through the handcuffs he said "Those seven years of MacGyver finally paid off."
The show was parodied in the 2009 Chick-fil-A calendar where the show in December was referred to as MooGyver.
The Jan. 29, 2009 episode of Eleventh Hour ("Eternal") has this exchange between characters Dr. Jacob Hood and FBI Agent Rachel Young:

Young: Don't tell me you're going to build some kind of bomb with champagne and baking soda?


Hood: Rachel, I'm a scientist. I'm not MacGyver. Shoot the lock.[33]


[edit] Mythbusters
In February 2008, the popular science show Mythbusters featured a MacGyver special which tested several of MacGyver's tactics. The first test examined MacGyver's famous cold capsule bomb, which utilized the explosive reaction of alkali metals with water. Supposedly, dropping 1 gram of sodium metal into water will cause an explosive reaction powerful enough to blow a hole through a cinderblock wall. However, despite using 100 grams of sodium metal, the wall remained completely intact. It was "busted," along with MacGyvers's ultralight aircraft built from bamboo, garbage bags, duct tape and a cement mixer engine which failed to sustain flight and immediately crashed after traveling off a cliff.
However, some of MacGyver's tactics were confirmed. The Mythbusters were able to pick a lock using the filament of an incandescent lightbulb, although it took the Mythbusters considerably longer to do than it took MacGyver (50 minutes as opposed to 56 seconds). Another "confirmed" MacGyver tactic was building an electromagnet using ordinary household batteries, tape and insulated wire (the insulated rubber surrounding the wire was removed with a cheese grater.) They then successfully used this device to magnetize an unfolded paper clip (by passing it repeatedly over the magnet) and then, by embedding the paperclip in a piece of cork and placing it in a small bowl of water, the paperclip acted as a compass (because it was magnetized, it pointed to the North Magnetic Pole.)
It was also implied, although it was not successfully tested, that it is possible to develop a roll of film using orange juice as an acid and ammonia as an alkaline fixer while holding a garbage bag over the setup to create a darkroom.
Another implied, but not tested, tactic was creating a potato cannon using hairspray as a fuel, a camp stove as the ignition, and PVC pipe as the mortar.
Also, in Episode 15, in July 2004, a portion of the episode titled "Car Capers" featured the Mythbusters testing if an egg placed into a radiator of a car would subsequently cook and plug holes in said radiator. This was featured in an episode of MacGyver titled "Bushmaster", and was originally an idea sent in by a fan. The myth was deemed plausible by MacGyver and Mythbusters alike.

^ Season 4, Episode 2 - "Blood Brothers". MacGyver goes back to his home town and meets two childhood friends and in flashbacks we see the accidental death of friend Jesse by a bullet from a falling gun. In the first episode "Pilot," MacGyver fires an AK-47 at some Russian soldiers. This episode was before MacGyver's dislike of firearms was established, however his dislike of guns is shown almost immediately in subsequent episodes of the series.
