TWiki is a structured wiki[1], typically used to run a collaboration platform, knowledge or document management system, a knowledge base, or team portal. Users can create wiki applications using the TWiki Markup Language, and developers can extend its functionality with plugins.
The TWiki project was founded by Peter Thoeny. TWiki itself was a fork, in 1998, of the GPL wiki JOSWiki, created by Markus Peter and Dave Harris.[2][3]
TWiki is currently undergoing a fork process, with most of the developer community continuing development on the rebranded codebase Foswiki due to action by the project leadership.[4]

RSS/Atom feeds and e-mail notification
Over 400 Extensions and 200 Plugins


[edit] TWiki extensions
TWiki has a plugin API that has spawned over 400 extensions[5] to link into databases, create charts, tags, sort tables, write spreadsheets, create image gallery and slideshows, make drawings, write blogs, plot graphs, interface to many different authentication schemes, track Extreme Programming projects and so on.

[edit] TWiki application platform
TWiki as a structured wiki provides database-like manipulation of fields stored on pages[6], and offers a SQL-like query language to embed reports in wiki pages.[7]
Wiki applications are also called situational applications because they are created ad-hoc by the users for very specific needs. Users have built TWiki applications[8] that include call center status boards, to-do lists, inventory systems, employee handbooks, bug trackers, blog applications, discussion forums, status reports with rollups and more.

[edit] User interface
The interface of TWiki is completely skinnable in templates, themes and (per user) CSS. It includes support for internationalization ('I18N'), with support for multiple character sets, UTF-8 URLs, and the user interface has been translated into Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish [9].

[edit] TWiki deployment
TWiki is primarily used at the workplace as a corporate wiki[10] to coordinate team activities, track projects, implement workflows[11] and as an Intranet Wiki. The TWiki community estimates 40,000 corporate wiki sites as of March 2007, and 20,000 public TWiki sites[12].
TWiki customers include Fortune 500 such as Nokia, Motorola and Yahoo!, as well as small and medium enterprises[13], such as ARM[14] and DHL[15].

[edit] Realization
TWiki is implemented in Perl. Wiki pages are stored in plain text files. Everything, including meta such as access control settings, are version controlled using RCS. RCS is optional since an all-Perl version control system is provided.
TWiki scales reasonably well even though it uses plain text files and no relational database to store page data. Many corporate TWiki installations have several hundred thousand pages and tens of thousands of users. Load balancing and caching can be used to improve performance on high traffic sites[16].
TWiki has database features built into the engine. A TWiki Form[6] is attached to a page as meta data. This represents a database record. A set of pages that share the same type of form build a database table. A formatted search[17] with a SQL-like query[18] can be embedded into a page to construct dynamic presentation of data from multiple pages. This allows for building wiki applications and constitutes the TWiki's notion of a structured wiki.

[edit] Fork of 2008
On October 27, 2008, the company TWiki.net eliminated the elected board of directors of TWiki, assumed direct control over the TWiki project, and requested that all contributors agree to a new code of conduct before being allowed to continue working on the project.[19][20] The bulk of TWiki's active contributors subsequently created a fork of the project named Foswiki.[21][20]
The IRC logs of the meeting which led up to this event show that there were two main issues.

Peter Thoeny had changed the access rights to the TWiki.org wiki, locking everyone out from the site unless they agreed to sign up to new terms and conditions.
The trademarks to the TWiki name were held by Peter Thoeny who was not willing to license them (on a perpetual basis) to the community.
