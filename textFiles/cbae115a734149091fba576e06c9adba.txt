[edit] Holocene

[edit] 10th millennium BCE

Circa 10,000 BCE — North America: Dire Wolf, Smilodon, Giant beaver, Ground sloth, Mammoth, and American lion all become extinct.








— World: Sea levels rise abruptly and massive inland flooding occurs due to glacier melt.
— Bering Sea: Land bridge from Siberia to North America disappears as sea level rises.
— North America: Long Island becomes an island when rising waters break through on the western end to the interior lake








Circa 9700 BCE — Lake Agassiz forms from glacial melt-water.
Circa 9600 BCE — Younger Dryas cold period ends. Pleistocene ends and Holocene begins. Large amounts of previously glaciated land become habitable again.
Circa 9500 BCE — Ancylus Lake, part of the modern-day Baltic Sea, forms.
Circa 9000 BCE - end of the pre-Boreal period of European climate change. Pollen Zone IV Pre-boreal, associated with juniper, willow, birch pollen deposits.


[edit] 9th millennium BCE

Circa 8000 BCE — World - Rising Sea levels.








— Antarctica - long-term melting of the Antarctic ice sheets is commencing.
— Asia - rising sea levels caused by postglacial warming.
— World - Obliteration of more than 40 million animals about this time.[citation needed]
— World human population reaches 1 million.
— North America - The glaciers were receding and by 8,000 BCE the Wisconsin had withdrawn completely.
— World - Inland flooding due to catastrophic glacier melt takes place in several regions.








[edit] 8th millennium BCE

Circa 7640 BCE — Date theorized for impact of Tollmann's hypothetical bolide with Earth and associated global cataclysm.


[edit] 7th millennium BCE

Circa 6500 BCE — English Channel formed
Circa 6200 BCE — The 8.2 kiloyear event, a sudden significant cooling episode
Circa 6100 BCE — The Storegga Slide, causing a megatsunami in the Norwegian Sea
Circa 6000 BCE — Climatic or Thermal Maximum, the warmest period in 125,000 years, with minimal glaciation and highest sea levels. (McEvedy)




— Rising sea levels form the Torres Strait, separate Australia from New Guinea.
— Increasing desiccation of the Sahara. End of the Saharan Pluvial period.
— Associated with Pollen Zone VI Atlantic, oak-elm woodlands, warmer and maritime climate. Modern wild fauna plus, increasingly, human introductions, associated with the spread of the Neolithic farming technologies.
— Rising sea levels from glacial retreat flood what will become the Irish Sea, separating the island of Ireland from the British Isles and Continental Europe.




[edit] 6th millennium BCE

Circa 5600 BCE — According to the Black Sea deluge theory, the Black Sea floods with salt water. Some 3000 cubic miles (12,500 km³) of salt water is added, significantly expanding it and transforming it from a fresh-water landlocked lake into a salt water sea.
Circa 5500 BCE — Beginning of the desertification of north Africa, which ultimately lead to the creation of the Sahara desert. It's possible this process pushed some natives into migrating to the region of the Nile in the east, thereby laying the groundwork for the rise of Egyptian civilization.
Circa 5000 BCE — The Older Peron transgression, a global warm period, begins.
5000 BCE — Use of a sail begins. The first known picture is on an Egyptian urn found in Luxor.


[edit] 4th millennium BCE

Circa 3600 BCE - 2800 BCE — Climatic deterioration in Western Europe and the Sahara. In Europe Pollen zone VII Sub Boreal, oak and beech. Glacial advances of the Priora oscillation, with lower economic prosperity in areas not able to irrigate in the Middle East.
Circa 3100 BCE — The Indus Valley Civilization constructs the first advanced system of drainage.


[edit] 3rd millennium BCE

2900 BCE — Floods at Shuruppak from horizon to horizon, with sediments in Southern Iraq, stretching as far north as Kish, and as far south as Uruk, associated with the return of heavy rains in Nineveh and a potential damming of the Karun River to run into the Tigris. This ends the Jemdet Nasr period and ushers in the Early Dynastic Period of Sumer cultures of the area. Possible association of this event with the Biblical deluge.
2650 BCE — Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh describes vast tracts of cedar forests in what is now southern Iraq. Gilgamesh defies the gods and cuts down the forest, and in return the gods say they will curse Sumer with fire (or possibly drought). By 2100 BC, soil erosion and salt buildup have devastated agriculture. One Sumerian wrote that the "earth turned white." Civilization moved north to Babylonia and Assyria. Again, deforestation becomes a factor in the rise and subsequent fall of these civilizations.






— Some of the first laws protecting the remaining forests decreed in Ur.






2600 BCE — First artificial sewage systems constructed in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro of the Indus valley. There were networks of brick-lined sewage drains and outdoor flush toilets connected.
2500 BCE — Sahara becomes fully desiccated. Desiccation had been proceeding from 6000 BCE, as a result of the shift in the West African tropical monsoon belt southwards from the Sahel. Subsequent rates of evaporation in the region led to a drying of the Sahara, as shown by the drop in water levels in Lake Chad. Tehenu of the Sahara attempt to enter into Egypt, and there is evidence of a Nile drought in the pyramid of Unas.
2200 BCE — Beginning of a severe centennial-scale drought in northern Africa, southwestern Asia and midcontinental North America, which very likely caused the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt as well as the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia.


[edit] 2nd millennium BCE

1900 BCE — The Atra-Hasis Epic describes Babylonian flood, with warnings of the consequences of human overpopulation.
1450 BCE — Minoan civilization in the Mediterranean declines, but scholars are divided on the cause. Possibly a volcanic eruption was the source of the catastrophe (see Minoan eruption). On the other hand, gradual deforestation may have led to materials shortages in manufacturing and shipping. Loss of timber and subsequent deterioration of its land was probably a factor in the decline of Minoan power in the late Bronze Age, according to John Perlin in A Forest Journey.
1206 BCE - 1187 BCE — Evidence of major droughts in the Eastern Mediterranean. Hittite and Ugarit records show requests for grain were sent to Egypt, probably during the reign of Pharaoh Merenptah. Carpenter has suggested that droughts of equal severity to those of the 1950s in Greece, would have been sufficient to cause the Late Bronze Age collapse. The cause may have been a temporary diversion of winter storms north of the Pyrenees and Alps. Central Europe experienced generally wetter conditions, while those in the Eastern Mediterranean were substantially drier. There seems to have been a general abandonment of peasant subsistence agriculture in favour of nomadic pastoralism in Central Anatolia, Syria and northern Mesopotamia, Palestine, the Sinai and NW Arabia.
c 2000 BCE-1000 BCE - The Sarasvati River dries up. Desertification of the Thar Region begins.


[edit] 1st millennium BCE

800 BCE - 500 BCE — Sub-Atlantic period in Western Europe. Pollen Zone VIII, sub-Atlantic. End of last Sea Level rise. Spread of "Celtic fields", Iron Age A, and Haalstadt Celts. Increased prosperity in Europe and the Middle East.
500 BCE — Roman Republic, Cloaca Maxima (big sewer) is built in Rome by Etruscan dynasty of Tarquins. As Rome grows, a network of cloacae (sewers) and aqueducts are built.




— World human population reached 100 million[1].




250 BCE — Ashoka introduces animal welfare legislation in India
Circa 225 BCE — The Sub-Atlantic began about 225 BCE (estimated on the basis of radiocarbon dating) and has been characterized by increased rainfall, cooler and more humid climates, and the dominance of beech forests. The fauna of the Sub-Atlantic is essentially modern although severely depleted by human activities. The Sub-Atlantic is correlated with pollen zone IX; sea levels have been generally regressive during this time interval, though North America is an exception.
Circa 200 BCE — Sri Lanka first country in the world to have a nature reserve, King Devanampiyatissa established a wildlife sanctuary


[edit] 1st millennium CE

100 to 400 — Decline of Roman Empire may have been partly due to lead poisoning, according to modern historian and toxicologist Jerome Nriagu. Romans used lead acetate ("sugar of lead") to sweeten old wine and turn grape pulp into a sweet condiment. Usually the acidic wine or pulp was simply left in a vat with sheets of lead. An aristocrat with a sweet tooth might have eaten as much as a gram of lead a day. Widespread use of this sweetener would have caused gout, sterility, insanity and many of the symptoms which were, in fact, present among the Roman aristocrats. High levels of lead have been found in the bones of aristocratic Romans. Far more than simply using lead pipes or lead utensils, the direct consumption of lead-sweetened wine and foods created serious and widespread lead poisoning among upper-class Romans.
535-536: global climate abnormalities affecting several civilizations.


[edit] 7th century

676 — Cuthbert of Lindisfarne enacts protection legislation for birds on the Farne Islands (Northumberland, UK).

[edit] 18th century

1700 — Some 600 ships are engaged in hauling "sea coal" from Newcastle to London, an enormous increase compared to 1650, when only two ships regularly carried sea coal. Rapid industrialization and the demand for iron and naval supplies has stripped England's forests.
1711 — Jonathan Swift notes the contents of London's gutters: "sweepings from butchers' stalls, dung, guts and blood, drowned puppies, stinking sprats, all drenched in mud..."
1720 — In India, hundreds of Bishnois Hindus of Khejadali go to their deaths trying to protect trees from the Maharaja of Jodhpur, who needed wood to fuel the lime kilns for cement to build his palace. This event has been considered as the origins of the 20th century Chipko movement.
1739 — Benjamin Franklin and neighbors petition Pennsylvania Assembly to stop waste dumping and remove tanneries from Philadelphia's commercial district. Foul smell, lower property values, disease and interference with fire fighting are cited. The industries complain that their rights are being violated, but Franklin argues for "public rights."
