Tribadism


Tribadism or tribbing, also known by the slang term 'scissoring', is a form of non-penetrative sex in which a woman rubs her vulva against her partner's vulva for sexual stimulation.[1][2] This may involve female-to-female genital contact or a female rubbing her vulva against her partner's thigh, arm or stomach; it can also refer to a masturbation technique in which a woman rubs her vulva against an inanimate object such as a bolster, in an effort to achieve orgasm. The term is most often used in the context of lesbian sex, but is not exclusive to lesbians.

[edit] History
Until the 20th century, the term was used to refer to lesbian sexual practices in general. Therefore, lesbians were occasionally called tribades.[3]

[edit] Tribadism among bonobo females
This position is not exclusive to humans. Females of the bonobo species, found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, also engage in female-female genital sex, usually known as GG rubbing (genito-genital).[4][5]

[edit] Safe sex issues
As with any exchange of bodily fluids during sexual activities, tribadism has the potential to transfer sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) if those are present in one or more of the partners. Participants have the option of safe sex practices.[6]

[edit] Tribadism in popular culture

The glam pop band Scissor Sisters derived their name from the scissoring position.[7]
Bands named after tribadism include Scissorfight and the lesbian punk band Tribe 8.[8]
Genital-genital tribadism was depicted three times during the "D-Yikes!" episode of the cartoon South Park, referred to in that episode as "scissoring".
Australian band Rocksteady pay homage to tribadism with their song "Scissoring".
