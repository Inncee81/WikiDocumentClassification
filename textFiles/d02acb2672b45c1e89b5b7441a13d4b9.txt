South Park Republican was a term that circulated in weblogs and articles on the Internet circa 2001 and 2002, to describe what authors claimed as a "new wave" of young adults and teenagers who hold center-right political beliefs that are, in general, aligned with those portrayed in the popular animated television show South Park. The phrase was coined by commentator Andrew Sullivan[1] in 2001. Sullivan identified himself as a South Park Republican after hearing that the show's creators had "outed" themselves as Republicans at an awards ceremony.
While South Park co-creator Matt Stone is a registered Republican,[citation needed] co-creator Trey Parker is actually a registered member of the Libertarian Party.[2] Matt Stone sums it up: "I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals."[3]
In August 2006 Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Andrew Sullivan headlined a conference in Amsterdam hosted by the libertarian monthly magazine Reason. During an on-stage interview with Reason editors Nick Gillespie and Jesse Walker, Stone and Parker reaffirmed their discomfort with labels while acknowledging that their political views could be described most accurately as libertarian. John Tierney documented the declaration on the pages of the New York Times a few days later in a column called "South Park Refugees".[4] "South Park Libertarians," an edited version of the interview, appeared in the December 2006 issue of Reason.[4][5]
