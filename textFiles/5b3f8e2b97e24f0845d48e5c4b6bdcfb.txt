The Future Is Wild was a Canadian 2003 joint Animal Planet/ORF (Austria) and ZDF (Germany) co-production, which used computer-generated imagery to show the possible future of life on Earth. The seven-part television series was released with a companion book written by geologist Dougal Dixon, author of several "anthropologies/zoologies of the future" such as After Man: A Zoology of the Future, in conjunction with natural history television producer John Adams.
Based on research and interviews with dozens of scientists, this documentary was put together to show how life could evolve in the future if Homo sapiens became extinct; the Discovery Channel broadcast softened the harsh outlook by stating the human race had completely migrated from the Earth and had sent back probes to examine the progress of life on Earth. The show was played out in the form of a nature documentary. For a time in 2005, a theme park based on this program was opened in Japan. In 2008, a special on the Discovery Channel about the development of the video game Spore was combined with airings of The Future Is Wild.

[edit] Ecosystems
Twelve ecosystems were chosen at three points in time:-

[edit] 5 million years' time

The world is in an ice age and there are giant seabirds and carnivorous bats. The ice sheets extended to as far south as Paris in the northern hemisphere and as far north as Buenos Aires in the southern hemisphere. The Amazon Rainforests dried up and opened into grasslands. The North American plains shrivelled to become cold desert. Africa collided with Europe and closed off the Mediterranean Sea again. With no water to replace it in the dry climate, the Mediterranean dried out into a giant salt flat dotted with brine lakes, as it has been in the past. Most of Europe became frozen tundra. The part of Africa east of the African Rift Valley has broken off of Africa. Asia has dried up and is now mountainous. The once dry area of Central America has now been transformed into warm dry tropical forests. Australia has moved north and collided with eastern Indonesia.
Denizens
Babookari, a ground-living New World monkey, descended from the present-day uakari.
Carakiller, a giant flightless bird of prey, descended from the present-day caracara.
Cryptile, a frilled lizard that inhabits salt flats and has a sticky frill.
Deathgleaner, a giant carnivorous bat.
Gannetwhale, a seal-like seabird, descended from the present-day gannet.
Gryken, a slender terrestrial mustelid, descended from the present-day pine marten.
Rattleback, an armoured rodent, descended from the present-day agouti.
Desert Rattleback, another type of rattleback, which lives in deserts. Herbivorous, unlike other species
Scrofa, a rock-dwelling wild boar.
Shagrat, a giant rodent which lives in herds and migrates with the seasons in northern Europe, descended from the present-day marmot .
Snowstalker, a giant saber-toothed mustelid, descended from the present-day wolverine.
Spink, a small mole-like burrowing bird, descended from the present-day quail.


[edit] 100 million years' time

The world is very hot, octopuses have come onto land, and there are enormous tortoises. Much of the land is flooded by shallow seas. The surrounding land has become brackish swamps. Antarctica has drifted towards the tropics, and once again it is covered with trees, as it was 300 million years before. Australia has collided with North America and Asia, forcing up an enormous, 10-kilometre-high mountain plateau taller than the modern Himalayas. Greenland has been reduced to a small, temperate island. While low lying land is warm shallow seas, cold deep ocean trenches form. Africa's Sahara Desert has once again become Rich Grasslands as it was millions of years ago.
Denizens
Falconfly, a giant predatory wasp.
Grass Tree, a species of plant in the Great Plateau that is harvested by Silver Spiders to feed the Poggles, descended from bamboo.
Great Blue Windrunner, a giant four-winged bird: its legs have flight feathers on and can act as gliding surfaces, descended from the present-day crane.
Lurkfish, a giant big-mouthed electric fish.
Ocean Phantom, a giant jellyfish.
Poggle, the last mammal, descended from the present-day hamster.
Reef Glider, a swimming sea slug.
Roachcutter, a swift jungle bird.
Silver Spider, a large colonial spider.
Spindle trooper, a giant sea spider. They live in Ocean Phantoms, which they defend against enemies.
Spitfire Bird, a species of flutterbird which spits corrosive liquid.
False Spitfire Bird, a species of bird that resembles the Spitfire Bird, but is harmless.
Spitfire Beetle, a cooperative predatory beetle which preys on Spitfire Birds.
Spitfire Tree, a flowering tree that makes two chemicals collected by the Spitfire Birds, which in the process pollinates the tree.
Swampus, a terrestrial octopus.
Toraton, a giant tortoise, grows to 120 tons.





Map of the potential layout of the future world (~200 million years hence)



[edit] 200 million years' time

The world is recovering from a mass extinction caused by a flood basalt eruption almost as large in size as the one that created the Siberian Traps. Fish have taken to the skies, squid to the forests and the world's largest ever desert is filled with strange worms and insects. All the continents have collided into one another and fused into a single supercontinent, a second Pangaea. Due to one single current system and one large global ocean, deadly hurricanes smother the coastlines of the continent all year long. The northwestern side of Pangaea II, drenched with an endless supply of rain, has become a temperate forest. Mountains resting at the end of the coast block most of the rain's moisture from reaching a long line of scrubby rainshadow deserts. The very center of the continent does not receive rain at all and has become barren plantless desert. At this time most of the common life forms such as Mammals, Reptiles, Birds and Amphibians are extinct, leaving fish, insects, worms and mollusks to populate the Earth.
Denizens
Bumblebeetle, a flying insect which lives and breeds inside the carcasses of dead Flish.
Deathbottle, a carnivorous plant, residing in the Rainshadow Desert.
Desert Hopper, a hopping snail with a modified single foot.
Forest Flish, a bird-like fish that no longer lives in the oceans, but instead flies like birds.
Ocean Flish, another type of Flish that relies on the ocean more than the Forest Flish.
Garden Worm, an algae-filled worm that feeds only on sunlight.
Megasquid, an elephant-sized omnivorous terrestrial squid. Its 8 arms have evolved into walking legs like an elephant's. It uses its two long tentacles for feeding.
Rainbow squid, a giant chameleonic squid.
Sharkopath, a bioluminescent pack-hunting shark.
Silverswimmer, fish-sized neotenous crustaceans.
Slickribbon, a cave-dwelling predatory worm.
Slithersucker, a giant slime mold.
Squibbon, a terrestrial tree-swinging squid. Relatively intelligent; the likeliest ancestor for future sapient life.
Terabyte, a colonial termite that has become highly specialized.
Gloomworm, a primitive bacteria-eating worm.

[edit] DVD release
The series was released on three DVDs. The first DVD in the series includes episodes 1-5, the second includes episodes 6-9, and the third includes episodes 10-13. The three DVDs have also been released together as a set.
Both the DVD singles and the 3-DVD set are available for DVD regions one and two. Although the singles are available for region four, the 3-DVD set is not. Magna Pacific, the company contracted to market the Future is Wild series to Australasia, originally planned to release the 3-DVD set in May. When asked in December 2005, the Executive Director of Magna Pacific stated, "We have this scheduled for a May release." However, when asked again in August 2006, the National Marketing Manager of Magna Pacific announced, "Unfortunately the 3-DVD set of Future is Wild has been withdrawn from release, the singles will continue to be available but plans for the release of the 3-DVD set have been placed on hold with no future date set at this stage."
