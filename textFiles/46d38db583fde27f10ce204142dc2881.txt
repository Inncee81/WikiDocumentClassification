An ETag (entity tag) is an HTTP response header returned by an HTTP/1.1 compliant web server used to determine change in content at a given URL. When a new HTTP response contains the same ETag as an older HTTP response, the contents are considered to be the same without further downloading. The header is useful for intermediary devices that perform caching, as well as for client web browsers that cache results. One method of generating the ETag is based on the last modified time of the file and the size of the file, another is using a checksum.
If the ETag is generated incorrectly, it can lead to updated files not being redownloaded by the user agent, or files that are already in the cache being downloaded again.
