KisMAC





KisMAC on Mac OS X


Latest release
0.21a


Operating system
Mac OS X


Type
Wi-Fi tool


License
GPL


Website
http://kismac-ng.org/


KisMAC is a wireless network discovery tool for Mac OS X. It has a wide range of features, similar to those of Kismet, its Linux/BSD namesake and far exceeding those of NetStumbler, its closest equivalent on Windows. The program is geared toward network security professionals, and is not as novice-friendly as similar applications.
Distributed under the GNU General Public License,[1] KisMAC is free software.
KisMAC will scan for networks passively on supported cards - including Apple's AirPort, and AirPort Extreme, and many third-party cards, and actively on any card supported by Mac OS X itself. The Atheros Wi-Fi cards found in various Intel Macs are now supported in passive mode, but only in developer builds, and only just work properly.
Cracking of WEP and WPA keys, both by brute force, and exploiting flaws such as weak scheduling and badly generated keys is supported when a card capable of monitor mode is used, and packet reinjection can be done with a supported card (Prism2 and some Ralink cards). GPS mapping can be performed when an NMEA compatible GPS receiver is attached.[2]
Captured network information can be uploaded to the .kismac service (a spoof on .mac), which collates network scans from many users to provide a public interface. Data can also be saved in pcap format and loaded into programs such as Wireshark.

[edit] KisMAC and Germany
The project was created and led by Michael Rossberg until July 27, 2007, when he removed himself from the project due to changes in German law (specifically, StGB Section 202c) that "prohibits the production and distribution of security software".[3]
As of August 6, 2007, the former homepage now denounces the new German law, but also has the text "Visit KisMAC in the Netherlands soon!", which implies that a new lead developer has emerged.
As of August 17, 2007, the software has reappeared with the website hosted in Switzerland and the code hosted both on Google Code and a Subversion server in the Netherlands.
