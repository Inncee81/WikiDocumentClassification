From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Timeless Way of Building is a 1979 book that ties life and architecture together, written by Christopher Alexander.
It has had a huge influence on creative thinking, especially in the areas of architecture and software design.[citation needed]
In the book, Alexander introduces the concept of the "quality without a name", and argues that we should seek to include this nameless quality in our buildings. Alexander attempts to the idea by surrounding it with existing concepts that reflect a part of the quality with no name but are not sufficient to define it individually.[citation needed]
This book popularized the concept of the pattern language.[citation needed]
Other books in the same series are:

A Pattern Language (volume 2)
The Oregon Experiment (volume 3)
