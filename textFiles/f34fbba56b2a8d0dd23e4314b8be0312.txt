Exact Audio Copy, or often simply EAC, is a proprietary CD ripping program for Microsoft Windows. It has also been tested to work under newer versions of Wine on Linux.[1] This program was created by Andre Wiethoff, a student at the University of Dortmund in Germany. In 1998, he became "fed up with other audio grabbers"[2] and decided to develop his own.
EAC is used to convert the tracks on standard audio CDs to .wav files, which can then be transcoded into formats such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis, WavPack, and FLAC using external encoders. It supports AccurateRip (automatically compare your copy with rips from other people)[3] and can automatically create Cue Sheets, with all gaps, track attributes, ISRC, and CD-Text included.
Exact Audio Copy is freeware, free for non-commercial use[4] and highly popular among audiophiles for its high accuracy and ability to rip severely damaged audio Compact Discs.
