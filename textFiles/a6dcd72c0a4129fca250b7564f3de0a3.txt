[edit] Other films in general 100
Some other films with notable romantic roles, which were excluded from the list (of the top "100 Passions"), were listed instead in the general top 100, from 1998 or 2007. They include:
From the 1998 list:



15. Star Wars (1977) - Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford;
57. The Third Man (1949) - Orson Welles and Alida Valli;
59. Rebel Without a Cause (1955) - Natalie Wood and James Dean;
60. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - Karen Allen and Harrison Ford;
75. Dances with Wolves (1990) - Mary McDonnell and Kevin Costner;
82. Giant (1956) - Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson & James Dean.



From the 2007 list:



63. Cabaret (1972) - Liza Minelli and Michael York;
91. Sophie's Choice (1982) - Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline;
95. The Last Picture Show (1971) - Cybil Shepard and Timothy Bottoms; and
97. Blade Runner (1982) - Sean Young and Harrison Ford.



The selection of the top movies varied depending on the applicable criteria and the group of voters for the particular list.
Considering the extra films in the general 100, the count of multiple roles increases as follows:

Harrison Ford (5), Elizabeth Taylor (3), Natalie Wood (3), Meryl Streep (3), Rock Hudson (2) and James Dean (2).

The counts could run higher when including supporting roles.
