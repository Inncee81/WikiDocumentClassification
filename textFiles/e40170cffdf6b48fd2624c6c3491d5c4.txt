[edit] Festvox
The Festvox project aims to make the building of new synthetic voices more systematic and better documented, making it possible for anyone to build a new voice. It is distributed under a free software license similar to the MIT License.
Festvox is a suite of tools for building synthetic voices for Festival. It includes a step-by-step tutorial with examples in document called Building Synthetic Voices.

[edit] Flite
Flite is a small run-time speech synthesis engine developed at Carnegie Mellon University. It is derived from Festival, originally from the University of Edinburgh, and the Festvox project from Carnegie Mellon University.

[edit] Linux compatibility
There is a Festival plug-in for GStreamer. Festival is pre-packaged for several Linux distributions.
