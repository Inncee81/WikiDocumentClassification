[edit] Myriad MM
Myriad was first issued in 1992 as a multiple master Type 1 font family, which worked with a compliant font renderer to allow the user to generate variations in a wide range of widths and weights. Myriad MM was discontinued in 2003.

[edit] Myriad (Type 1)
This Postscript Type 1 font family was released after the original Myriad MM. It initially included 4 fonts in 2 weights, with complementary italics.
All these Type 1 versions supported the ISO-Adobe character set. All were discontinued in the early 2000s.

[edit] Myriad Condensed
It was a condensed version, released around 1998. The condensed fonts comprise 3 weights, with complementary italics.

[edit] Myriad Headline
A "Headline" version was also released, which has the weight of Myriad Bold, but slightly narrower.

[edit] Myriad Web
Myriad Web is a version of Myriad in TrueType font format, optimized for onscreen use. It supports Adobe CE and Adobe Western 2 character sets. Myriad Web comprises only five fonts: Myriad Web Pro Bold, Myriad Web Pro Regular, Myriad Web Pro Condensed Italic, Myriad Web Pro Condensed, Myriad Web Pro Italic.
Myriad Web Pro is slightly wider than Myriad Pro, while the width of Myriad Web Pro Condensed is between Myriad Pro Condensed and Myriad Pro SemiCondensed.
The family is bundled as part of the Adobe Web Type Pro font pack.

[edit] Myriad Pro
Myriad Pro is the OpenType version of the original Myriad font family. It first shipped in 2000, as Adobe moved towards the OpenType standard. Additional designers were Christopher Slye and Fred Brady. Compared to Myriad MM, it added support for Latin Extended, Greek, and Cyrillic characters, and oldstyle figures.
Myriad Pro originally included 30 fonts in 3 widths and 5 weights each, with complementary italics. A "semi-condensed" width was added several years later, expanding the family to 40 fonts in 4 widths and 5 weights each, with complementary italics.
Myriad Pro Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic are bundled with Adobe Reader 7.0 and higher.

[edit] Myriad Wild
Myriad Wild is an Adobe font package comprising the Myriad Sketch and Myriad Tilt fonts in Type 1 format. Myriad Sketch is a slightly irregular outline version of Myriad, while Myriad Tilt incorporates irregular stroke weight and paths. The family supports ISO-Adobe character set.

[edit] Myriad Wild Std
Myriad Wild Std is the OpenType version of Myriad Wild. It supports Adobe Western 2 character set.

[edit] Kozuka Gothic
Kozuka Gothic is a Japanese typeface, designed as a sans-serif companion to Kozuka Mincho family. The Japanese letters were designed by Masahiko Kozuka and Adobe’s Japanese type design team. The Latin letters in Kozuka Gothic were adapted from Myriad.

[edit] Adobe Heiti
Adobe Heiti is a simplified Chinese typeface that borrows its Latin glyphs from Myriad.
It is included with Adobe Illustrator CS3[1], Adobe Reader 8 Simplified Chinese font pack, Adobe Creative Suite 4.0[2].

[edit] Usages




Adobe's Myriad is the typeface which is used in Apple's modern marketing.


Since the launch of the eMac in 2002, Myriad replaced Apple Garamond as Apple Inc.'s corporate font. It is now used in all of its marketing and on its products (See Apple typography). More recent iterations of the iPod (from the iPod photo onward) have used Podium Sans, which has similarities with Myriad (as opposed to Chicago), for its user interface. A different humanist sans-serif typeface, Lucida Grande, is used as the system font for Apple's Mac OS X operating system. Myriad was included with 3rd generation of iPod.[3]
Myriad is also used in the corporate identities of Wells Fargo, bragster, and Modern Telegraph, as the primary headline typefaces of those companies.
KCRC (a rail transport company in Hong Kong) developed Casey in 1996, which uses a Myriad roman condensed for English and Formata Cond for numbers.
The 2008 revision of the Wal-Mart logo uses a heavily customized version of Myriad.
Myriad Black is one of two official standard typefaces of the University of Virginia.[4]
CBS affiliate KPHO uses the Myriad font for their third-lower graphics
A variety of fonts from the Myriad family are used on most CT Transit schedules.

[edit] Awards
Myriad Pro won bukva:raz! 2001 under the Greek and Cyrillic categories.[5]
Myriad Pro Greek won TDC2 2000 (Type Directors Club Type Design Competition 2000) in the Text/display type systems category.[6]
