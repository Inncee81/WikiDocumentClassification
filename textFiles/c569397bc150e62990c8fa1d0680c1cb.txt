Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language. It is built over the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, with the intention of allowing real-time computer game development without the restraints and low-level mechanics of the C programming language and its derivatives. This is based on the assumption that the most consuming functions inside games (mainly the graphics part) can be completely abstracted from the game logic in itself, making it possible to use a high-level programming language like Python to structure the game.
Pygame was built to replace pySDL after its sudden death. [1]
Pygame was originally written by Pete Shinners and is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License. It is now an open source free software community project (since around 2004/2005).

2D Engines and Libraries:

Phil's Pygame Utilities (PGU) is a collection of tools and libraries that enhance Pygame. Tools include a tile editor and a level editor (tile, isometric, hexagonal). GUI enhancements include full featured gui, html rendering, document layout, and text rendering. The libraries include a sprite and tile engine (tile, isometric, hexagonal), a state engine, a timer, and a high score system. (Note pgu is now unmaintained).
