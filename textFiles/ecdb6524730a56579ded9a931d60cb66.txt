From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
An aptronym is a name aptly suited to its owner. Fictional examples of aptronyms include Mr. Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wiseman in John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678), and the principal cast of the Mr Men (1971).
A related phrase is nominative determinism, popularised by New Scientist magazine, suggesting, with tongue firmly in cheek, that people's life choices are influenced by their names. The distinction is subtle but fundamental: as post-hoc versus propter-hoc, so aptronym versus nominative determinism.

[edit] Other Examples
In the book What's in a Name? (1996), author Paul Dickson cites a long list of aptronyms originally compiled by Professor Lewis P. Lipsitt, of Brown University. A sampling from the list:

James Bugg, exterminator
Dan Druff, barber
Rev. James R. God, minister of the Baptist Church in Congress, South Carolina
Priscilla Flattery, Environmental Protection Agency publicist
William Headline, Washington, D.C. bureau chief for CNN
C. Sharpe Minor, an organist
U.S. Navey, member of the United States Marine Corps
Quentin Jammer, NFL cornerback
Ima Assman proctologist
Robert Killingback, chiropractor

Some aptronyms are ironic rather than descriptive. The former Archbishop of Manila, Jaime L. Sin known as "Cardinal Sin," is a notable example. Dickson's book also lists a Rev. Richard Sinner of Fargo, North Dakota. Gene Weingarten of the Washington Post has called these "inaptonyms"[1]

[edit] Other issues
Aptronyms may be called "aptonyms" by other writers. San Francisco columnist Herb Caen used the term "namephreaks". Washington Post columnist Bob Levey prefers the term PFLNs, or Perfect Fit Last Names.
There does not yet seem to be a standard terminology for this linguistic curiosity.
