[edit] Biography



This section requires expansion.


Rifkin was born in Denver, Colorado in 1945, to Vivette Ravel Rifkin and Milton Rifkin, a plastic-bag manufacturer.[2] He grew up on the southwest side of Chicago.
He earned a BA in economics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1967. He was a self-described, "party animal", and also class president. He had an epiphany when one day in 1966 he walked past a group of students picketing the administration building and was amazed to see, as he recalls, that "my frat friends were beating the living daylights out of them. I got very upset." He organized a freedom-of-speech rally the next day. From then on, Rifkin quickly became an active member of the peace movement.
He went on to graduate study in international affairs at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
He pursued anti-war activities at Fletcher. He avoided the Viet Nam war by joining VISTA and humorously claimed he instead "saw action" as an unpaid tutor in the Brooklyn and East Harlem ghetto neighborhoods of New York City.
In 1973 he published his first book, How To Commit Revolution American Style, with John Rossen. In 1977, with Ted Howard, he founded the Foundation on Economic Trends. The foundation continues to be his main calling card. He works out of an office on L Street in Washington, D.C., a neighborhood home to many lobbyists.[3]
He is married to Carol Grunewald.[4]

[edit] Published works
Rifkin has seventeen published books—primarily focused on the impact of scientific and technological changes—in which he has predicted changes in: work, property, the American dream, the dangers of biotechnology, and a new hydrogen economy.
Rifkin became one of the first major critics of the nascent biotechnology industry with the 1977 publication of his book, Who Should Play God? His 1995 book, The End of Work, is credited by some with helping shape the current global debate on technology displacement, corporate downsizing and the future of jobs. His 1998 book, The Biotech Century, addresses the many critical issues accompanying the new era of genetic commerce. His 2004 book, The European Dream, was an international bestseller and winner of the 2005 Corine International Book Prize in Germany for the best economic book of the year

[edit] Renewable hydrogen economy
After the publication of The Hydrogen Economy, Rifkin worked both in the U.S. and the EU to advance the political cause of renewably generated hydrogen. In the U.S., Rifkin was instrumental in founding the Green Hydrogen Coalition. The GHC consists of 13 environmental and political organizations (including Greenpeace and MoveOn.Org) that are committed to building a renewable hydrogen based economy.

[edit] Foundation on Economic Trends
The Foundation on Economic Trends (FOET), based in Washington D.C. is active in both national and international public policy issues related to the environment, the economy, and biotechnology. FOET examines new trends and their impacts on the environment, the economy, culture and society, and engages in litigation, public education, coalition building and grassroots organizing activities to advance their goals.

[edit] Reception of his work
Rifkin has sparked controversies about his positions. Time Magazine went so far as to call him "the most hated man in science".[5] Groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists have cited some of his publications as useful references for consumers.[6]
