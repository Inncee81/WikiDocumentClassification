The Tata Nano is a rear-engined, four-passenger city car built by Tata Motors, aimed primarily at the Indian market. It was first presented at the 9th annual Auto Expo on 10 January 2008, at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi, India.[4] Tata Motors commercially launched Nano on March 23, 2009, with bookings from April 9 to April 25.[5]The sales of the car will begin in July 2009,[6] with a starting price of Rs 115,000 (rupees), cheaper than the Maruti 800, its main competitor and next cheapest Indian car priced at 184,641 Rupees. It also has an 8 percent smaller exterior size and a 23 percent larger interior space compared to Maruti 800.[7][8][9] Tata had sought to produce the least expensive production car in the world[10] — aiming for a starting price of Rs.100,000 (approximately US$2,000 in March 2009).[11][12]
In early 2008 the news magazine Newsweek identified the Nano as a part of a "new breed of 21st-century cars" that embody "a contrarian philosophy of smaller, lighter, cheaper" and portend a new era in inexpensive personal transportation — and potentially, "global gridlock".[13] The Wall Street Journal confirmed a global trend toward small cars, which includes the Nano.[14]
"Nano" means "small" in Gujarati[15], the language of the founders of the Tata Group. In English, the prefix "nano-" is often used to mean small. This derives from the Greek root 'nanos', meaning dwarf.

[edit] Overview
The introduction of the Nano received media attention due to its targeted low price. The Financial Times reported[16]: "If ever there were a symbol of India’s ambitions to become a modern nation, it would surely be the Nano, the tiny car with the even tinier price-tag. A triumph of homegrown engineering, the $2,200 (€1,490, £1,186) Nano encapsulates the dream of millions of Indians groping for a shot at urban prosperity." The car is expected to boost the Indian economy, create entrepreneurial-opportunities across India[17][18], as well as expand the Indian car market by 65%[19]. The car was envisioned by Ratan Tata, Chairman of the Tata Group and Tata Motors, who has described it as an eco-friendly "people's car". Nano has been greatly appreciated by many sources and the media for its low-cost[20][21] and eco-friendly initiatives which include using compressed-air as fuel[22] and an electric-version (E-Nano)[23][24]. Tata Group is expected to mass-manufacture the Nano, particularly the electric-version, and, besides selling them in India, to also export them worldwide[25][26][27].
Critics of the car have questioned its safety in India (where reportedly 90,000 people are killed in road-accidents every year[28]), and have also criticised the pollution that it would cause[29] (including criticism by Nobel Peace Prize winner Rajendra Pachauri[30]). However, Tata Motors has promised that it would definitely release Nano's eco-friendly models alongside the gasoline-model[31][32].
The Nano was originally to have been manufactured at a new factory in Singur, West Bengal, but increasingly violent protests forced Tata to pull out October 2008. (See Singur factory pullout below.) Currently, Tata Motors is reportedly manufacturing Nano at its existing Pantnagar (Uttarakhand) plant and a mother plant has been proposed for Sanand Gujarat.[33]. The company will bank on existing dealer network for Nano initially.[34] The new Nano Plant could have a capacity of 500,000 units, compared to 300,000 for Singur. Gujarat has also agreed to match all the incentives offered by West Bengal government.[35]

[edit] Design
Ratan Tata, the Chairman of Tata Motors, began development of the world's cheapest production car in 2003,[36] inspired by the number of Indian families with two-wheeled rather than four-wheeled vehicles.[37] The Nano's development has been tempered[clarification needed] by the company's success in producing the low cost 4 wheeled Ace truck in May 2005.[36]
Contrary to speculation that the car might be a simple four-wheeled auto rickshaw, The Times of India reported the vehicle is "a properly designed and built car".[38] The Chairman is reported to have said, "It is not a car with plastic curtains or no roof — it's a real car."[36]
To achieve its design goals, Tata refined the manufacturing process, emphasized innovation and sought new design approaches from suppliers.[38] The car was designed at Italy's Institute of Development in Automotive Engineering — with Ratan Tata requesting certain changes, such as the elimination of one of two windscreen wipers.[36] Some components of the Nano are made in Germany by Bosch, such as Fuel Injection, brake system, Value Motronic ECU, ABS and other technologies.[39]
The Nano has 21% more interior space (albeit mostly as headroom, due to its tall stance) and an 8% smaller exterior compared to its closest rival, the Maruti 800. Tata offered the car in three versions: the basic Tata Nano Std; the Cx; and the Lx. The Cx and Lx versions each have air conditioning, power windows, and central locking. Tata has set its initial production target at 250,000 units per year.[citation needed]

[edit] Cost Cutting features

The Nano's boot does not open, instead the rear seats can be folded down to access the boot space.[40][41]
It has a single windscreen wiper instead of the usual pair.
Some exterior parts of it are glued together, rather than welded.
It has no power steering.
Its door opening lever was simplified.[42]
It has 3 nuts on the wheels instead of the statutory 4 nuts.
It only has 1 side view mirror[43]


[edit] Quality features
Japanese and Korean steel is used to make quality body panels.[44]

[edit] Price



Wikinews has related news: World's cheapest car launched in India, will go on sale in April


Tata initially targeted the vehicle as "the least expensive production car in the world"[10] — aiming for a starting price of 100,000 rupees or approximately US$2000 (using exchange rate as of March 22, 2009) [11][12] 6 years ago, despite rapidly rising material prices at the time.[45]
As of August 2008, material costs had risen from 13% to 23% over the car’s development,[46] and Tata faced[citation needed] the choice of:

introducing the car with an artificially low price through government subsidies and tax-breaks[citation needed]
forgoing profit on the car[citation needed]
using vertical-integration to artificially boost profits on cars at the expense of their materials industries[citation needed]
partially using inexpensive polymers or biodegradable plastics instead of a full metal-body[citation needed]
raising the price of the car[46]


[edit] Model versions
At its launch the Nano was available in three trim levels:[9]

the basic Tata Nano Std priced at 123,000 Rupees has no extras;
the deluxe Tata Nano CX at 151,000 Rupees has air conditioning;
the deluxe Tata Nano TX at 135,000 Rupees has air conditioning, Yellow Colour Taxi Version;
the luxury Tata Nano LX at 172,000 Rupees has air conditioning, power windows and central locking
the Nano Europa, European version of the Tata Nano has all of the above plus a larger body, bigger 3-cylinder engine, anti-lock braking system (ABS) and meets European crash standards and emission norms.

The base model will have fixed seats, except for the driver's, which will be adjustable,[clarification needed] while the deluxe and luxury models will get air conditioning and body coloured bumpers.[47]

[edit] Technical specifications
According to Tata Group's Chairman Ratan Tata, the Nano is a 33 PS (33 hp/24 kW) car with a 623 cc rear engine and rear wheel drive, and has a fuel economy of 4.55 L/100 km (21.97 km/L, 51.7 mpg (US), 62 mpg (UK)) under city road conditions, and 3.85 L/100 km on highways ( 25.974 km/L, 61.1 mpg (US), 73.3 mpg (UK)). It is the first time a two-cylinder non-opposed petrol engine will be used in a car with a single balance shaft.[48] Tata Motors has reportedly filed 34 patents related to the innovations in the design of Nano, with powertrain accounting for over half of them.[49] The project head, Girish Wagh has been credited with being one of the brains behind Nano's design.[49][50]
Much has been made of Tata's patents pending for the Nano. Yet during a news conference at the New Delhi Auto Expo, Ratan Tata pointed out none of these is revolutionary or represents earth-shaking technology. He said most relate to rather mundane items such as the two-cylinder engine’s balance shaft, and how the gears were cut in the transmission.
Though the car has been appreciated by many sources, including Reuters due to "the way it has tweaked existing technologies to target an as-yet untapped segment of the market", yet it has been stated by the same sources that Nano is not quite "revolutionary in its technology", just low in price.[51] Moreover, technologies which are expected of the new and yet-to-be-released car include a revolutionary compressed-air fuel system[52] and an eco-friendly electric-version,[23] technologies on which Tata is reportedly already working, though no official incorporation-date for these technologies in the new car has been released.
According to Tata, the Nano complies with Bharat Stage-III and Euro-IV emission standards.[53] Ratan Tata also said, 'The car has passed the full-frontal crash and the side impact crash'.[54] Tata Nano passed the required 'homologation’ tests with Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI).This means that the car has met all the specified criteria for roadworthiness laid out by the government including emissions or noise & vibration and can now ply on Indian roads. Tata Nano managed to score around 24 km per litre during its ‘homologation’ tests with ARAI. This makes Tata Nano the most fuel efficient car in India. Nano will be the first car in India to display the actual fuel mileage figures it recorded at ARAI’s tests on its windshield. According to ARAI it conforms to Euro IV emission standards which will come into effect in India in 2010.[55]

Rear mounted engine

The use of a rear mounted engine to help maximize interior space makes the Nano similar to the original Fiat 500, another technically innovative "people's car". A concept vehicle similar in styling to the Nano, also with rear engined layout was proposed by the UK Rover Group in the 1990s to succeed the original Mini but was not put into production.[56] The eventual new Mini was much larger and technically conservative. The independent, and now-defunct, MG Rover Group later based their Rover CityRover on the Tata Indica.
Tata is also reported to be contemplating offering a compressed air engine as an option.[57]

Besides the regular and conventional petrol-variant,[32] the following variants are also expected:

[edit] Diesel
Wheelsunplugged.com reported that an anonymous source claimed a diesel variant would be available in September 2009.[64]

[edit] Compressed-air engine
Tata Motors is working with a French firm on using compressed air as an energy source.[52] The company has tied up with Moteur Development International (MDI) for this purpose.[32]

[edit] Electric drivetrain or electric-version
Tata is also believed to be making an electric version of the Nano, called the E-Nano (reportedly with attached or sideby solar panels as well)[23][65] which might well turn out to be the "world's cheapest electric car"[66] which is more eco-friendly and has many enthusiasts and media for its support.[67] It's supposed to be as cheap as the conventional gasoline version. Tata is making the Nano compliant with export market regulations[68] and plans to export such a car worldwide, particularly to the UK and the rest of continental Europe,[69][70] the US,[71] and Australia.[72][73][74][75]
Economic Times reported[76] that the "electric Nano" "would still make good sense for economic, clean and green personal mobility in countries around the world." According to the Hamburg-based newspaper, Auto Bild, the E-Nano would be built in cooperation with the Norwegian electric car specialist, Miljøbil Grenland AS.[77] [78][79][80]

[edit] Hybrid
Leftlanenews reported that "a hybrid version [of Tata Nano] is also likely, although it is not yet known whether the electric motor will be paired with a gasoline or diesel version."[81]

[edit] Nano Europa
Tata Motors unveiled a version of the Nano mini-car called the Nano Europa at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. The car will be coming to mainland Europe and the UK.[82] and will have a number of improvements over the standard nano. The Nano Europa has an increased wheelbase, a new engine and improved interiors and exteriors. The Nano Europa will be more expensive than the standard Nano with prices said to be around the US$ 6000 mark.[83]

According to one report, India as well as other nations, such as European nations[84], have great expectations from the Nano and are keenly awaiting it, especially the electric version of the Nano,[85] making it in all probability the "world's cheapest electric car" officially on record.[86][87] The car itself is expected to boost the Indian Economy as well as expand the Indian car market by 65%, according to rating agency CRISIL.[88]

[edit] Others

Effect on Indian Economy

Economic Times quotes:[89]


“

Tata Nano’s launch could expand the Indian car market by 65%, according to rating agency CRISIL. The low price makes the car affordable for families with incomes of Rs 1 lakh [100,000] per annum, the agency said. The increase in the market is expected to push up car sales by 20% over the previous year. “The unveiling of Tata Nano, the cheapest car in the world, triggers an important event in the car market. Based on the statement by company officials, CRISIL Research estimates the consumer price of the car at around Rs 1.3 lakh. This brings down the cost of ownership of an entry level car in India by 30%,” the company said in a report.

”


Thus, the Indian Economy is expected to remain strong and grow in 2008 and beyond, despite the temporary financial turmoil in the US, because the car may lead to a boost in other sectors of the Indian Economy besides the auto-market.
However, due to the current Singur land dispute, the "Stalled Car Factory" is "Costing Jobs, Splitting Neighbors in West Bengal".[90]
VOANews quotes:[90]


“

Tata's problems in West Bengal are scaring off other industries hoping to locate here, including Infosys, a software maker that wants to build a business park that would provide 5,000 jobs.
Kartik Chandra Malik, 57, runs a tea shop near the boundary wall of Tata's Nano factory.
He says he is frustrated that the factory has been stopped. He says wants it to open, because when it is open he can do more business selling tea and biscuits. He is hoping his son, who just graduated from college, will get a good job at the factory.
Many of Malik's neighbors in Barispada are tight-lipped when it comes to talking about Tata's troubles. There is growing tension in the villages near the Tata factory as the protests continue and the plant remains closed. The Tata crisis pits neighbors against each other.
Malik says many of his neighbors are being pressured by opposition groups to protest against the carmaker. But many here already have jobs lined up at the factory or hope to.
A young man at Malik's tea shop said he got a job loading trucks at the Tata plant. For that, many of neighbors have called him a traitor.

”



Guinness Book of World Records

IBN mentioned[91]:


“

The ambitious Nano car has not rolled out of the assembly line of the makers Tata's plants yet. But it is already in the Guinness book as the world's cheapest car.

”



Comparison with Model T

Some news-sources have compared Ratan Tata's Tata Nano with Henry Ford's Model T that coincidentally was built around a century ago. Livemint said:[92]


“

Ford Motor Co. is rich because Henry Ford used the assembly-line to produce the Model T in 1908. Ratan Tata is a late entrepreneur, making the Nano in 2008.
India is 100 years behind. But we are waking up to the possibility of catching up. I just hope our planners wake up soon.

”


Times of India mentioned:[93]


“

This raises the question: How have the Tatas accomplished such a task? Pursuing this question a fascinating story unfolds that reminds one of Henry Ford's Model T that was built exactly one hundred years ago (September 1908). Ford wanted to make a car for the multitude, not for the elite, with the best material and the best design that the technology of his time could devise, and he wanted to make it, above all, at a price that was affordable. This is the example that Ratan Tata has followed with determination. When he announced the price of his car in an interview to the Financial Times during the Geneva Motor Show, his colleagues were 'aghast', but he had set his goal.

After much speculation, Tata Motors announced on May 19, 2006 that it will be manufacturing Tata Nano from Singur, West Bengal.[94] However, within a week protests were started by a few farmers in the area against the acquisition of their lands by Tata.[95] The cause was taken up by Mamata Banerjee, the leader of Trinamool Congress.[96] The situation escalated with Tatas threatening to pull out,[97] and disruption of compensation for farmers who had volunteered to sell their land by anti-acquisition activists.[98] This was followed by a state-wide bandh by Trinamool Congress in October.[99] The government banned political parties from holding meetings or processions at Singur and installed a huge police force there.[100][101] There was widespread violence in the clashes between the police and the farmers on December 2, 2006.[102]
On December 4,2005 Mamata Banerjee entered into a hunger strike. A 48-hour strike was later called by her to protest the death of Tapasi, a Save Farmland Committee campaigner, whose burnt body was found at the Nano plant site in Singur.[103] Two CPM activists were later convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder.[104]On the 24th day of her strike, Banerjee was given oxygen support and finally called off her fast after appeals from the then President Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.[105]
As the protests over the land continued,[106] Ratan Tata accused that the competitors had a role in the controversy.[107] The acquisition of land was initially criticised, but later approved by the Calcutta High Court.[108] [109]As political unrest and rains hampered the construction, Tata Motors delayed the launch of Nano to September 2008.[110]
Violence continued throughout 2008 [111][112][113] and on September 2,2008 Tata Motors announced that they have suspended work at Singur.[114] On October 2 ,2008 Tata Motors announced that they are pulling out of Singur. [115] On October 7 2008, it was announced that the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi had signed an MoU with Tata Motors for allocating land for Nano factory in Sanand in Ahmedabad district of Gujarat.[116]

[edit] Criticism, issues and problems

[edit] Questions of safety
The Times says[117]:


“

India has 8 percent of the world’s vehicle fatalities and less than 1 per cent of its cars, with more than 90,000 people killed on the country’s roads every year. Introducing a million Nanos into the mix may bring more – and unwelcome – headlines.
Tata, which has the only crash-test facility in the country, said that the Nano "exceeds current regulatory requirements". And while it is not a deathtrap – it has crumple zones, seat belts and strong seat anchors – it is worth bearing in mind that total vehicle crash testing (rather than just frontal impact), airbags and antilock braking systems are not mandatory.
Without these, the Nano would not even be considered for approval in Britain. Adding them would double its price in India, which is why they have been omitted.

”


It is believed that Tata Motors will offer a version of the Nano with these safety-features, including an airbag system in its electric version[citation needed]. Tata said the Nano has an all sheet-metal body, with safety features such as crumple zones, intrusion-resistant doors, seat-belts, strong seats and anchorages, and the rear tailgate glass bonded to the body. Tires are tubeless.[118]

[edit] Mass motorization
As the Nano was conceived and designed around introducing the automobile to a sector of the population who are currently using eco-friendly bicycles and motorcycles, environmentalists are concerned that its extraordinarily low price might lead to mass motorization in countries like India and therefore possibly aggravate pollution as well as increase the demand for oil.[119] The ecology focused German newspaper die tageszeitung feels that such concerns are "inappropriate" as the Tata Nano has lower emissions compared to the average Volkswagen, and that developing countries shouldn't be denied the right to motorized mobility when industrialized countries should be looking to reduce their emissions and usage of cars.[120] Die Welt reports that the car conforms with environmental protection, and will have the lowest emissions in India.[121]
In crowded metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Ratan Tata has conceived a scheme to only offer the Nano to those individuals who do not have an automobile already. The Nano will also replace many overloaded and worn-out two-stroke polluting vehicles, both two and three-wheeled. According to Anumita Roychowdhury, associate director of the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi, "the low-cost cars will be disastrous" in the current policy and regulatory framework.[52]

[edit] Used car market effects
The Nano is alleged to have severely affected the used car market in India, as many Indians opt to wait for the Nano's release rather than buying used cars, such as the Maruti 800 (a rebadged Suzuki Alto), which is considered as the Nano's nearest competitor. Sales of new Maruti 800s have dropped by 20%, and used ones by 30% following the unveiling of the Nano. As one automotive journalist summarises; “People are asking themselves – and us - why they should pay, say, 250,000 Rupees for a Maruti Alto, when they can wait and get a brand new Nano for less in a few months’ time, a car that is actually bigger”.[122]

[edit] Competitors





It has been suggested that this section be split into a new article entitled Low cost car. (Discuss)


Rival car makers including Bajaj Auto, Fiat, General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai and Toyota Motor have all expressed interest in building a small car that is affordable to more middle-class consumers in emerging markets. The bulk of demand there is for small cars because people are much more sensitive to fuel prices.[123]
Honda and Toyota are leading the way on so called cleaner gasoline-electric hybrids, and some environmentalists argue getting prices down on these technologies is where efforts should be concentrated.[123]Inexpensive and eco-friendly electric-cars like Tara Tiny, Oreva Super (both reportedly even cheaper than Tata Nano) and REVA[124] pose even more significant danger to Nano. There are also rumors of Maruti Suzuki introducing a lower priced version of Alto to counter Tata Nano.[125]
