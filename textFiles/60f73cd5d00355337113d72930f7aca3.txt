SharpDevelop is a free and open source IDE for the C#, Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), Boo, and (starting from version 3.0) F# and IronPython programming languages.
It is typically used as an alternative to Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET. Early in its development there was a fork to Mono/Gtk# called MonoDevelop which includes multi-platform support.
For code completion SharpDevelop uses its own parsers for C# and VB.NET. They were generated using a grammar description and a modified version of the Coco/R compiler generator of the University of Linz. The source code contains this generator. For Boo, the parser from the Boo compiler is used, but resolving the type of expressions and type inference is done with custom code that supports lazy evaluation of the types. SharpDevelop 1.1 can import projects written with Visual Studio, SharpDevelop 2.0 can open and edit them directly. It also can translate whole projects from VB.NET to C# and vice-versa.
SharpDevelop 2.0 has an integrated debugger. It uses its own debugging library that communicates with the Microsoft .NET runtime using COM interop.
While SharpDevelop 2.0 uses the same MSBuild project files as Visual Studio, it is still able to use other .NET compilers such as older framework versions (1.0, 1.1) or the Mono compiler.

[edit] Features
SharpDevelop integrates a Windows Forms designer for C#, VB.NET and Boo, as well as an integrated debugger. Other features are listed on its official website.[1]
