[edit] Career
Birkin emerged in the Swinging London scene of the 1960s, starring as one of the models in the 1966 film Blowup.[2] In 1968, Birkin auditioned in France for the lead female role in Slogan. Though she did not speak French, she won the role. She co-starred with Serge Gainsbourg, and duetted with him on the film's theme song — the first of many collaborations between the two.
In 1969, she and Serge Gainsbourg released the duet "Je t'aime... moi non plus" ("I love you... me neither"). The song was originally written for Brigitte Bardot by Gainsbourg. The song caused a scandal for its sexual explicitness. The song was banned by radio stations in Italy, Spain, and the UK, arguably contributing to its commercial success all over Europe. The song's fame is a result of its salacious lyrics (sung in French) against a background of female moaning and groaning, culminating in an orgasm at the song's conclusion. Birkin also appeared on Gainsbourg's 1971 album Histoire de Melody Nelson, portraying the Lolita-like protagonist in song and on the cover.[3]
Birkin took a break from acting in 1971-72, but returned as Brigitte Bardot's lover in Don Juan (Or If Don Juan Were a Woman) in 1973.[1] In 1975, she appeared in Gainsbourg's first film, Je t'aime... moi non plus, which created a stir for frank examination of sexual ambiguity. For this performance she was nominated for a Best Actress César Award.[1]
Birkin starred in the Agatha Christie films Death on the Nile (1978) and Evil Under the Sun (1982), and recorded several albums, including Baby Alone in Babylone, Amours des Feintes, Lolita Go Home and Rendez-vous. She won Female Artist of the Year in the 1992 Victoires de la Musique.[1]
She starred in two films directed by Jacques Doillon — as Anne in La fille prodigue (1981) and as Alma in La pirate (1984, nominated for a César Award). This work led to an invitation from Patrice Chéreau to star on stage in La Fausse suivante by Marivaux at Nanterre. After this, she also began to appear frequently on stage in plays and concerts (in France, Japan, the UK and then the US).
In 1980 she worked with director Herbert Vesely on Egon Schiele Exzess und Bestrafung, appearing as the mistress of Austrian artist Egon Schiele, played by Mathieu Carrière.
Jacques Rivette collaborated with her for Love on the Ground (1983) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991, Nominated Césars best supporting actress). Additionally, she appeared in Merchant Ivory's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (1998, also used her song "Di Doo Dah") and Merci Docteur Rey (2002), while Le Divorce's end title song featured her singing "L'Anamour", composed by Serge Gainsbourg.[1]
In 2006, she played Elektra, directed by Philippe Calvario in France.[1]
Jane Birkin's humanitarian interests led her to work with Amnesty International on immigrant welfare and AIDS issues. Birkin has also visited Bosnia, Rwanda and Palestine, often working with children. In 2001, she was awarded the OBE. She has also been awarded the French Ordre National du Mérite.
She has collaborated with artists such as Feist, Beth Gibbons from Portishead, Bryan Ferry, Brian Molko from Placebo, Franz Ferdinand, Manu Chao, Brett Anderson from Suede, Mickey 3D, Françoise Hardy, Cali, The Divine Comedy, The Magic Numbers, Paolo Conte, Beck, Rufus Wainwright, Yann Tiersen, Alain Souchon, Les Negresses Vertes, Johnny Marr from The Smiths, Zazie, MC Solaar, Miossec, Yosui Inoue, Étienne Daho, Alain Chamfort, Jimmy Rowles, Goran Bregović, Sonny Landreth, The Soundtrack of Our Lives and many others.[1]
Birkin recorded the song "Beauty" on French producer Hector Zazou's 2003 album Strong Currents.[1]
Her image features on the cover art of Have You Fed the Fish? by singer-songwriter Badly Drawn Boy (which features her daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg on backing vocals).

[edit] Birkin bag
Hermès named and designed a handbag - the Birkin bag - for her in 1984 after the actress was seen in 1981 by the head of Hermès struggling with several bags while boarding an aeroplane. The Birkin bag has become one of Hermès' most popular and expensive handbags.

[edit] Personal life
She was married from 1965 until 1968 to John Barry, an English composer who wrote the musical score to the James Bond movies. Their daughter, the photographer Kate Barry, was born in 1967.
She had a passionate and creative relationship with her mentor Serge Gainsbourg — they met on the set of Slogan. They separated in 1980. Their daughter is actress Charlotte Gainsbourg.
In 1982 she gave birth to her third daughter, Lou Doillon, from her relationship with the director Jacques Doillon.
