From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
This page lists direct English translations of common Latin phrases, such as veni vidi vici and et cetera. Some of the phrases are themselves translations of Greek phrases, as Greek rhetoric and literature were highly regarded in ancient Rome when Latin rhetoric and literature were still maturing.
Be aware that the Latin letter i can be used as either a vowel or a consonant. When used as a consonant, it is often replaced by the letter j, which was originally simply an orthographic "long i" that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels. This medieval convention is most commonly preserved in Latin legal terminology—hence phrases like de iure are often spelled de jure. On this list, the more common form will be the one a phrase is listed under: thus, de jure is used instead of de iure, and alea iacta est instead of alea jacta est.
