Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is a set of techniques for the exchange of data among multiple threads in one or more processes. Processes may be running on one or more computers connected by a network. IPC techniques are divided into methods for message passing, synchronization, shared memory, and remote procedure calls (RPC). The method of IPC used may vary based on the bandwidth and latency of communication between the threads, and the type of data being communicated.
IPC may also be referred to as inter-thread communication and inter-application communication.
IPC, on par with the address space concept, is the foundation for address space independence/isolation.[1]

[edit] Implementations
There are a number of APIs which may be used for IPC. A number of platform independent APIs include the following:

Anonymous pipes and named pipes
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
Freedesktop.org's D-Bus
Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)
Message Bus (MBUS) (specified in RFC 3259)
Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM)
ONC RPC
Sockets
XML XML-RPC or SOAP
Thrift
TIPC
ZeroC's Internet Communications Engine (ICE)

The following are platform or programming language specific APIs:

Apple Computer's Apple events (previously known as Interapplication Communications (IAC)).
Enea's LINX for Linux (open source) and various DSP and general purpose processors under OSE
Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
KDE's Desktop Communications Protocol (DCOP)
Libt2n for C++ under Linux only, handles complex objects and exceptions
The Mach kernel's Mach Ports
Microsoft's ActiveX, Component Object Model (COM), Microsoft Transaction Server (COM+), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), anonymous pipes, named pipes, Local Procedure Call, Message loop, MSRPC, .NET Remoting and Windows Communication Foundation
Novell's SPX
POSIX mmap, message queues, semaphores, and Shared memory
RISC OS's messages
Solaris's Doors
System V's message queues, semaphores, and shared memory
Distributed Ruby
DIPC Distributed Inter-Process Communication

Table of IPC Methods:


Method
Provided by (Operating systems or other environments)


File
All operating systems.


Signal
Most operating systems; some systems, such as Windows, only implement signals in the C run-time library and do not actually provide support for their use as an IPC technique.


Socket
Most operating systems.


Pipe
All POSIX systems.


Named pipe
All POSIX systems, Windows.


Semaphore
All POSIX systems.


Shared memory
All POSIX systems.


Message passing
(shared nothing)
Used in MPI paradigm, Java RMI, CORBA and others.


memory-mapped file
All POSIX systems; may carry race condition risk if a temporary file is used. Windows also supports this technique but the APIs used are platform specific.


Message queue
Most operating systems.


Mailbox
Some operating systems.
