[edit] Personal history

[edit] Early family life
Valerie Elise Plame was born on April 19, 1963, on Elmendorf Air Force Base, in Anchorage, Alaska, to Diane and Samuel Plame.[1][2] Plame's paternal great-grandfather was a rabbi who emigrated from Ukraine; the original family surname was "Plamevotski" (Wilson, Fair Game 173).
Growing up in "a military family ... imbued her with a sense of public duty"; her father was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force, who worked for the National Security Agency for three years, and, according to her "close friend Janet Angstadt," her parents "are the type who are still volunteering for the Red Cross and Meals on Wheels in the Philadelphia suburb where they live," having moved to that area while Plame was still in school.[3]

[edit] Education
She graduated in 1981 from Lower Moreland High School, in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania,[4][5] and attended Pennsylvania State University, graduating with a B.A. in advertising in 1985.[3] While a student at Penn State, she was a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority.[6] and worked for the business section of the Daily Collegian student newspaper.[3]
By 1991, Plame earned two master's degrees, from the London School of Economics and Political Science and the College of Europe (Collège d'Europe), in Bruges, Belgium.[1][3] In addition to English, she speaks French, German, and Greek.[3]

[edit] Marriages and family
After graduating from Penn State in 1985, Plame was briefly married to Todd Sesler, her college boyfriend.[3] In 1997, while she was working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Plame met former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson, IV "at a reception in Washington ... at the residence of the Turkish Ambassador."[7] According to Wilson, because she was unable to reveal her CIA role to him on their first date, she told him that she was an energy trader in Brussels, and he thought at that time that she was "an up-and-coming international executive."[5] After they began dating and became "close," Plame revealed her employment with the CIA to Wilson (Wilson, Politics of Truth 242).[5] They were married on April 3, 1998, Plame's second marriage and Wilson's third (Wilson, Politics of Truth 273).
Professionally and socially, she has used variants of her name. Professionally, while a covert CIA officer, she used her given first name and her maiden surname, "Valerie Plame." Since leaving the CIA, as a speaker, she has used the name "Valerie Plame Wilson," and she is referred to by that name in the civil suit that the Wilsons brought against former and current government officials, Plame v. Cheney.[1] Socially, and in public records of her political contributions, since her marriage in 1998, she has used the name "Valerie E. Wilson."
At the time that they met, Wilson relates in his memoir, he was separated from his second wife Jacqueline, a former French diplomat; they divorced after 12 years of marriage so that he could marry Plame. His divorce had been "delayed because I was never in one place long enough to complete the process," though he and she had already been living separate lives since the mid-90s.[7] Plame and Wilson are the parents of twins, Trevor Rolph and Samantha Finnell Diana, born in January 2000. From his first marriage (1973-1986), to Susan Dale Otchis, Wilson is also the father of another set of twins (also a boy and a girl), Sabrina Cecile and Joseph Charles, who were born in 1975.
Prior to the disclosure of her classified CIA identity, Valerie and Joe Wilson and their twins lived in the Palisades, an affluent neighborhood of Washington, D.C., on the fringe of Georgetown.[3] After she resigned from the CIA following the disclosure of her covert status, in January 2006, they moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico.[8][9]

[edit] Career




Presenting a lecture on her book Fair Game, at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island, on December 4, 2007.


After graduating from college, moving to Washington, D.C., and marrying Sesler, she worked at a clothing store while awaiting results of her application to the CIA.[3] She was accepted into the 1985-86 CIA officer training class and began her training for what would become a twenty-year career with the Agency.[9] Although the CIA will not release publicly the specific dates from 1985 to 2002 when she worked for it, due to security concerns,[10][9] Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald affirmed that Plame "was a CIA officer from January 1st, 2002, forward" and that "her association with the CIA was classified at that time through July 2003.[11] Due to the nature of her clandestine work for the CIA, many details about Plame's professional career are still classified, but it is documented that she worked for the CIA in a clandestine capacity relating to counter-proliferation.[12][13][14][9]
Plame served the CIA as a non-official cover (or NOC), operating undercover in (at least) two positions in Athens and Brussels.[15] While using her own name, "Valerie Plame," her assignments required posing in various professional roles in order to gather intelligence more effectively.[16][17][18] Two of her covers include serving as a junior consular officer in the early 1990s in Athens and then later an energy analyst for the private company (founded in 1994) "Brewster Jennings & Associates," which the CIA later acknowledged was a front company for certain investigations.[19]
A former senior diplomat in Athens remembered Plame in her dual role and also recalled that she served as one of the 'control officers' coordinating the visit of President George H.W. Bush to Greece and Turkey in July 1991.[20] After the Gulf War in 1991, the CIA sent her first to the London School of Economics and then the College of Europe, in Bruges, for Master's degrees. After earning the second one, she stayed on in Brussels, where she began her next assignment under cover as an "energy consultant" for Brewster-Jennings.[3] Beginning in 1997, Plame's primary assignment was shifted to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
She married Wilson in 1998 and gave birth to their twins in 2000,[21] and resumed travel overseas in 2001, 2002, and 2003 as part of her cover job. She met with workers the nuclear industry, cultivated sources, and managed spies.[22] Part of her work involved ensuring that Iran did not acquire nuclear weapons.[23]
Part of her work during this time was concerned with determining the use of aluminum tubes purchased by Iraq.[24] CIA analysts prior to the Iraq invasion were quoted by the White House as believing that Iraq was trying to acquire nuclear weapons and that these aluminum tubes could be used in a centrifuge for nuclear enrichment.[25][26] However, David Corn and Michael Isikoff argued that the undercover work being done by Mrs. Wilson and her CIA colleagues in the Directorate of Central Intelligence Nonproliferation Center strongly contradicted such a claim.[24]

[edit] "Plamegate"




Flow of Valerie Plame Information


Main article: CIA leak grand jury investigation
Main article: Plame affair
Further information: Plame affair criminal investigation
Novak's disclosures in his column, which resulted in Plame's public outing on July 14, 2003, ended her career with the CIA, from which she later resigned in December 2005.[27][28]
Although court affidavits of the Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald and exhibits pursuant to later U.S. Congressional investigations ascertain otherwise, some in the media (Jeff Gannon - White House reporter) questioned whether or not the CIA still considered Plame a covert officer — that is, the precise nature of her "classified" status or the type of "cover" that she had and whether or not it was "official" or "non-official" — at the time she was outed in the Novak column of July 14, 2003.[29] But official legal documents published in the course of the CIA leak grand jury investigation, United States v. Libby, and Congressional investigations fully establish her classified employment as a covert officer for the CIA at the time that Novak's column was published in July 2003.[28][30][31]
In his press conference of October 28, 2005, Fitzgerald explained in considerable detail the necessity of "secrecy" about his grand jury investigation that began in the fall of 2003 — "when it was clear that Valerie Wilson's cover had been blown" — and the background and consequences of the indictment of Lewis Libby as it pertains to Valerie E. Wilson.[11]
Fitzgerald's subsequent replies to reporters' questions shed further light on the parameters of the "leak investigation" and what, as its lead prosecutor, bound by "the rules of grand jury secrecy," he could and could not reveal legally at the time.[11] Official court documents released later, on April 5, 2006, reveal that Libby testified that "he was specifically authorized in advance" of his meeting with New York Times reporter Judith Miller to disclose the "key judgments" of the October 2002 classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE). According to Libby's testimony, "the Vice President later advised him that the President had authorized defendant to disclose the relevant portions of the NIE [to Judith Miller]."[32] According to his testimony, the information that Libby was authorized to disclose to Miller "was intended to rebut the allegations of an administration critic, former ambassador Joseph Wilson." A couple of days after Libby's meeting with Miller, then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told reporters, "We don't want to try to get into kind of selective declassification" of the NIE, adding "We're looking at what can be made available."[33] A "sanitized version" of the NIE in question was officially declassified on July 18, 2003, ten days after Libby's contact with Miller, and was presented at a White House background briefing on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq.[34] The NIE contains no references to Valerie Plame or her CIA status, but the Special Counsel has suggested that White House actions were part of "a plan to discredit, punish or seek revenge against Mr. Wilson."[35] President Bush had previously indicated that he would fire whoever outed Plame.[33]
A court filing by Libby's defense team argued that Plame was not foremost on the minds of administration officials as they sought to rebut charges made by her husband, that the White House manipulated intelligence to make a case for invasion. The filing indicated that Libby's lawyers did not intend to say he was told to reveal Plame's identity.[36] The court filing also stated that "Mr. Libby plans to demonstrate that the indictment is wrong when it suggests that he and other government officials viewed Ms. Wilson's role in sending her husband to Africa as important," indicating that Libby's lawyers planned to call Karl Rove to the stand. According to Rove's lawyer, Fitzgerald has decided against pressing charges against Rove.[27]
The five-count indictment of Libby included perjury (two counts), obstruction of justice (one count), and making false statements to federal investigators (two counts).

[edit] Libby trial
Main article: United States v. Libby
On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice, making false statements, and two counts of perjury. He was acquitted on one count of making false statements. He was not charged for revealing Wilson's CIA status. His sentence included a $250,000 fine, 30 months in prison and two years of probation. On July 2, 2007, President George W. Bush commuted Libby's sentence, removing the jail term but leaving in place the fine and probation, calling the sentence "excessive."[37][38] In a subsequent press conference, on July 12, 2007, Bush noted, "...the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision."[39] The Wilsons responded to the commutation in statements posted by their legal counsel, Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and on their own legal support website.

[edit] Wilson v. Cheney
Main article: Wilson v. Cheney
On July 13, 2006, Joseph and Valerie Wilson filed a civil lawsuit against Rove, Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney, and other unnamed senior White House officials (among whom they later added Richard Armitage[40]) for their alleged role in the public disclosure of Valerie Wilson's classified CIA status.[41] Judge John D. Bates dismissed the Wilson's lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds on July 19, 2007;[42][43][44][45] the Wilsons appealed. On August 12, 2008, in a 2-1 decision, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the dismissal.[46][47] Melanie Sloan, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which represents the Wilsons, "said the group is considering asking the full D.C. Circuit to review the case and an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court."[46][48]

[edit] House Oversight Committee hearing
On March 8, 2007, two days after the verdict in the Libby trial, Congressman Henry Waxman, chair of the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, announced that his committee would ask Plame to testify on March 16, in an effort by his committee to look into "whether White House officials followed appropriate procedures for safeguarding Plame's identity."[49][50]
On March 16, 2007, at these hearings about the disclosure, Waxman read a statement about Plame's CIA career that had been cleared by CIA director Gen. Michael V. Hayden and the CIA, stating that she was undercover and that her employment status with the CIA was classified information prohibited from disclosure under Executive Order 12958.
Subsequent reports in various news accounts focused on the following parts of her testimony:

"My name and identity were carelessly and recklessly abused by senior government officials in the White House and state department"; this abuse occurred for "purely political reasons."[51]
After her identity was exposed by officials in the Bush administration, she had to leave the CIA: "I could no longer perform the work for which I had been highly trained."[52]
She did not select her husband for a CIA fact-finding trip to Niger, but an officer senior to her selected him and told her to ask her husband if he would consider it: "I did not recommend him. I did not suggest him. There was no nepotism involved. I did not have the authority...."[52]


[edit] Fair Game




Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House, by Valerie Plame Wilson.



See main article: Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House

Joseph Wilson announced on March 6, 2007 that he and his wife had "signed a deal with Warner Bros of Hollywood to offer their consulting services - or maybe more - in the making of the forthcoming movie about the Libby trial," their lives and the CIA leak scandal.[53] The feature film, a co-production between Weed Road's Akiva Goldsman and Jerry and Janet Zucker of Zucker Productions with a screenplay by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth to be based in part on Valerie Wilson's memoir Fair Game (contingent on CIA clearances) originally scheduled for release in August 2007, but ultimately published on October 22, 2007.[54]
In May 2006, the New York Times reported that Valerie Wilson agreed to a $2.5 million book deal with Crown Publishing Group, a division of Random House. Steve Ross, senior vice president and publisher of Crown, told the Times that the book would be her "first airing of her actual role in the American intelligence community, as well as the prominence of her role in the lead-up to the war."[55] Subsequently, the New York Times reported that the book deal fell through and that Plame was in exclusive negotiations with Simon & Schuster.[56] Ultimately, Simon and Schuster publicly confirmed the book deal, though not the financial terms and, at first, no set publication date.[57][24]
On May 31, 2007, various news media reported that Simon and Schuster and Valerie Wilson were suing J. Michael McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, and Michael V. Hayden, Director of the CIA, arguing that the CIA "is unconstitutionally interfering with the publication of her memoir, Fair Game, ... set to be published in October [2007], by not allowing Plame to mention the dates she served in the CIA, even though those dates are public information."[58][59] Judge Barbara S. Jones, of the United States District Court for the District of New York, in Manhattan, had decided that Plame would not be able to state in her memoir precisely the dates that she had worked for the CIA, even though they are already published in documents in the public domain.[9]
On October 31, 2007, in her "conversation" with Charlie Rose broadcast on The Charlie Rose Show (recorded on October 29, 2007), she discussed many aspects relating to her memoir: the CIA leak grand jury investigation, United States v. Libby, the civil suit which she and her husband are still pursuing against Libby, Cheney, Rove, and Armitage, and other matters presented in her memoir relating to her covert work with the CIA.[60]
