The Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) draft, developed by the IETF's MMUSIC working group, provides a mechanism for NAT traversal, using various techniques. In particular, it is used to allow SIP-based VoIP clients to successfully traverse the variety of firewalls that may exist between a remote user and a network. It is also used by the Jingle extension to XMPP.
