[edit] History
Adium was originally created by college student Adam Iser, and the first version, "Adium 1.0", was released in September 2001 and supported only AIM. The version numbers of Adium since then have followed a somewhat unusual pattern. There were several upgrades to Adium 1.0, ending with Adium 1.6.2c.[2]
At this point, the Adium team began a complete rewrite of the Adium code expanding it into a multiprotocol messaging program. Pidgin's (formerly "Gaim") libpurple (then called "libgaim") library was implemented to add support for IM protocols other than AIM – since then, the Adium team mostly works on the GUI. The Adium team originally intended to release these changes as "Adium 2.0". However, Adium was eventually renamed to "Adium X" and released at version 0.50, being considered "halfway to a 1.0 product".[3]
After version Adium X 0.89.1, however, the team finally decided to change the name back to "Adium", and as such "Adium 1.0" was released on February 2, 2007.
Apple Inc. used Adium 0.89.1's build time in Xcode 2.3 as a benchmark for comparing the performance of the Mac Pro and Power Mac G5 Quad[4], and Adium 1.2's build time in Xcode 3.0 as a benchmark for comparing the performance of the eight-core Mac Pro and Power Mac G5 Quad.[5]

[edit] Protocols




Adium supports encryption through Off-the-Record Messaging. The left window shows messages as received by iChat, while the decrypted conversation can be seen on the right.


Adium supports the following protocols:

OSCAR including AIM, MobileMe (formerly known as .Mac) and ICQ services
XMPP (formerly known as Jabber) including Google Talk and LiveJournal services
.NET Messenger Service (also known as MSN and Windows Live)
Yahoo! Messenger, USA & Japan
Bonjour
MySpaceIM
Gadu-Gadu
Novell GroupWise
Lotus Sametime
Tencent QQ
Facebook Chat
MeBeam with a plugin
Tlen with a plugin
Xfire with the XBlaze plugin
Skype with a plugin
IRC (trunk builds only, very limited)
NateOn with a plugin


[edit] Plugins and customization
Adium makes use of a plugin architecture; many of the program's essential features are actually provided by plugins. The newest version includes support for file transfer, support for the Growl notifications system, Sparkle for program updates and support for encrypted messaging with the Off-the-Record Messaging library. Adium 0.88 was the first version compiled as a universal binary, allowing it to run natively on Intel-based Macs.
Adium is also highly customizable through the use of resources its developers call "Xtras". The program can be customized by the use of hundreds of third-party Xtras that alter the appearance of emoticons, dock icons, contact list styles, and messages styles. Adium can also be enhanced through the use of different sound sets. AppleScripts can also be utilized to automatically alter behavior in responses to certain triggers.
