Status of NPVIC legislation in current legislative session:



State shapes have been adjusted in the second map so that their sizes represent Electoral College strength.
















The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is an agreement among U.S. states that would effectively replace the current electoral college system of presidential elections with a direct, nationwide vote of the people. As of April 2009, this interstate compact has been joined by Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Washington; their 61 electoral votes amount to almost 23% of the 270 needed for the compact to take effect. As of April 2009, bills to join the compact have been introduced in forty-three additional states, although many are not pending. Bills to repeal the compact have been introduced in Maryland and New Jersey.
The compact is based on Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, which gives each state legislature the right to decide how to appoint its own electors. States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today 48 states award their electoral votes to the candidate with the most popular votes statewide.
States joining the compact will continue to award their electoral votes in their current manner until the compact has been joined by enough states to represent a controlling majority of the Electoral College (currently 270 electoral votes). After that point, all of the electoral votes of the member states would be cast for the winner of the national popular vote in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. With the national popular vote winner sure to have a decisive majority in the Electoral College, he or she would automatically win the Electoral College and therefore the presidency.

[edit] Background
Public opinion surveys suggest that a majority of Americans support the idea of a popular vote for president. A 2007 poll found that 72% favored replacing the Electoral College with a direct election, including 78% of Democrats, 60% of Republicans, and 73% of independent voters.[1] Polls dating back to 1944 have shown a consistent majority of the public supporting a direct vote.[2] The idea is popular for various reasons:

See also: Arguments against the Electoral College


The Electoral College may encourage campaigns to cater to voters in a few pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest of the country. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states got very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising.[3] This may mean that swing state issues receive more attention while issues important to other states are largely ignored.[4][5][6]


The Electoral College may also hurt voter turnout. Most voters living outside the swing states know well in advance who is likely to win their state, which may decrease their incentive to go to the polls and vote.[4][6] A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states.[7] A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% in the rest of the country—a 17% gap.[8]


There is debate over whether the Electoral College favors small states or large states. Those who argue that it favors small states point out that such states have more electoral votes relative to their populations.[9][10] Others, however, believe that the potential of large states to shift greater numbers of electoral votes gives them more actual clout.[11][12][13]


The Electoral College allows a candidate to win the presidency while losing the popular vote, as happened in the elections of 1876, 1888 and 2000. This scenario can affect both major parties. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore lost the election despite winning the popular vote. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush would have faced the same situation himself if there had been a 60,000 vote shift to John Kerry in Ohio.[4]

Opponents[who?] of NPV note that public understanding of the electoral college is low, and the Constitution is, by definition, not supposed to be subject to easy change based on popular opinion. They[who?] have raised concerns about the constitutionality of the legislation and, regardless of constitutionality, the wisdom of what some have called an "end run" around the Constitution. They note that while popular, electoral college reform is not a priority for most voters, in part because the College so rarely deviates from the popular vote that many voters do not even know it exists[citation needed]. They[who?]also argue against the proposal on federalism grounds. For more detail on arguments pro and con, see section on "Debate" below.

[edit] Details of the compact law
States join the compact by adopting it as a state law. The compact law[14] requires that:

The member state shall hold presidential elections by statewide popular vote.
After the election, the state's chief election official (usually the state Secretary of State) shall certify the number of popular votes cast in the state for each candidate and report those results to the other states by a specific deadline.
The chief election official shall then determine "national popular vote totals" for each candidate by adding up the vote totals reported by every state and the District of Columbia. (Each state is required to make official reports of vote totals to the federal government in the form of Certificates of Ascertainment.[15])
The state's electoral votes shall be awarded to the candidate with the greatest "national popular vote total."

The compact member states would give their electoral votes to the candidate with the greatest number of popular votes (a plurality), even if no candidate has a majority. In the extremely unlikely event of an exact tie in the national popular vote totals, each member state would award its electoral votes to the statewide winner, as is currently done in 48 states (Maine and Nebraska split their electoral votes based on results at the congressional district level).
The compact specifies that it shall take effect only if it is law in states controlling a majority of electoral votes on July 20 of a presidential election year. States wishing to join or withdraw from the compact after that date would not be able to do so until after the election. The compact would terminate in the event that the Electoral College is abolished.

[edit] History of the compact
The idea of abolishing the Electoral College by constitutional amendment has existed for some time (see Every Vote Counts Amendment). Though voting rights and electoral rules have been modified by constitutional amendment in the past, such amendments are difficult to pass because they require supermajorities in the House and Senate together with the support of three-fourths of the state legislatures.

[edit] Academic plan
In 2001 Northwestern University law professor Robert Bennett suggested a plan in an academic publication to implement a National Popular Vote through a mechanism that would embrace state legislatures’ power to appoint electors, rather than resist their power.[16] By coordinating, states constituting a majority of the Electoral College could effectively implement a popular vote.
Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar defended the constitutionality of such a plan.[17] They proposed that a group of states, through legislation, form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the balance of votes in their own state. These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control a majority of the electoral college (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win the electoral college.
The academic plan uses two constitutional features:

Presidential Electors Clause in Article 2, section 2 which gives each state the power to determine the manner in which its electors are selected.
Compact Clause, Article I, section 10, clause 3 under which it creates an enforceable compact.

The Amar brothers noted that such a plan could be enacted by the passage of laws in as few as eleven states and would probably not require Congressional approval, though this is not certain (see Debate below).

[edit] Advocacy in State Legislatures
John Koza, a computer science professor at Stanford had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions. (Koza is the inventor of the scratch-off lotto ticket). In 2006 Koza authored Every Vote Equal, a book that makes a detailed case for a specifically worded interstate compact to establish National Popular Vote. Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote, a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a bipartisan advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.
By the time of the group's opening news conference in February 2006, the proposed interstate compact had been introduced in the Illinois legislature. With backing from National Popular Vote, the NPVIC legislation was introduced in five additional state legislatures in the 2006 session. It passed in the Colorado Senate, as well as both houses of the California legislature before being vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
In 2007, NPVIC legislation was introduced in 42 state legislatures. It was passed by legislative chambers in Arkansas,[18] California,[19] Colorado,[20] Illinois,[21] New Jersey[22] and North Carolina,[23] as well as both houses of the Hawaii legislature, where it was prevented from becoming law by a veto from Governor Linda Lingle.[24] The bill was also passed by both houses in Maryland, which became the first state to join the compact when Governor Martin O'Malley signed it into law on April 10, 2007.[25]
New Jersey became the second state to enter the compact when Governor Jon S. Corzine signed the bill into law on January 13, 2008.[26] Illinois became the third state to join when Governor Rod Blagojevich signed it into law on April 7, 2008[21] and Hawaii became the fourth on May 1, 2008 after the legislature overrode a second veto from the governor.[27] Legislative chambers also passed the bill in Vermont (both houses, subsequently vetoed), [28] Rhode Island (both houses, also vetoed),[29] Washington,[30] and Maine (by a single vote in the senate;[31] the bill was subsequently defeated in the house[32]).
The bill was under consideration in several additional states in 2008, including passage in the Michigan house in December 2008. As of April 2009, the NPVIC legislation has been introduced in 48 states. States where at least one chamber has adopted the NPVIC legislation in 2009 include Arkansas, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.[33]
Two measures titled "Presidential Electors. Allocation by National Popular Vote. Interstate Agreement. Statute" were filed as California ballot propositions, but failed to get on the ballot.[34]

[edit] Debate

See also: Arguments against the Electoral College

The project has been supported by editorials in several newspapers, including the New York Times,[4] the Chicago Sun-Times, the Los Angeles Times,[35] the Boston Globe,[36] and the Minneapolis Star Tribune,[37] arguing that the existing system discourages voter turnout and leaves emphasis on only a few states and a few issues, while a popular election would equalize voting power. Others have argued against it, including the Honolulu Star-Bulletin.[10] An article by Pierre S. du Pont, IV, a former governor of Delaware, in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal[38] has called the project an urban power grab that would shift politics entirely to urban issues in high population states and allow lower caliber candidates to run. A collection of readings pro and con has been assembled by the League of Women Voters.[39]
Some of the major issues are detailed below:

[edit] Small states and rural areas
Supporters of the compact argue that most small states are ignored under the current system because they are not swing states. They contend that a national popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign in small, medium and large towns across the country, just as they currently do within competitive swing states. Critics of the compact counter that smaller states have fewer voters, which would lead candidates to ignore them and focus instead on states with large populations. They also argue that the large numbers of popular votes in urban areas would draw candidates away from rural issues and needs.[38][40]

[edit] Close elections and voter fraud
Opponents of the compact have suggested that a direct national election would raise concerns about election fraud. Former Delaware Governor Pete du Pont argues that in 2000, "Mr. Gore's 540,000-vote margin amounted to 3.1 votes in each of the country's 175,000 precincts. 'Finding' three votes per precinct in urban areas is not a difficult thing...". However, National Popular Vote has argued that a direct election would reduce the incentive for fraud. They contend that the large nationwide pool of 122 million votes would make a close outcome much less likely than it is under the current system, in which an extremely small number of votes in any one of the numerous statewide tallies may determine the national winner.[38][40]

[edit] Nature of elections
Although supporters of the compact point out that direct election is already the method by which Americans elect their members of Congress, state leaders and local officials, opponents such as du Pont have argued that a direct popular vote in presidential contests could lead to a change in the current two party system. They contend that the difficulty of winning electoral votes under the current system may discourage third party and single-issue candidates from running, and therefore switching to a popular vote may lead more third party and single-issue candidates to enter the race.[38][41]

[edit] Electoral votes awarded to national winner, not state winner
Two governors who have vetoed NPVIC legislation, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Linda Lingle of Hawaii, have stated that they object to the compact because it would mean that their states' electoral votes may be awarded to a candidate who did not win statewide. Supporters of the compact have countered that under the popular vote system, the awarding of electoral votes would be effectively irrelevant; that giving the state's electoral votes to the national winner would be a mere symbolic formality with no political meaning, because the popular vote would have already decided the outcome.[42][43][44]

[edit] Constitutionality
Some law scholars have raised doubts about the constitutionality of the compact, arguing that it could be struck down by the courts for various legal reasons, including violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act.[45] Others have described the NPVIC as "an end-run around the constitutional amendment process."[46]
According to Every Vote Equal, although Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution requires interstate compacts receive the consent of Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503 (1893), and several more recent cases, that such consent is not necessary except where a compact encroaches on federal supremacy.[47]
Some legal scholars and experts, however, believe that the NPVIC would affect the federal system in such a way that it requires Congressional approval. For example, Derek Muller argues that the compact affects non-compacting states in that it takes away their right to allocate their electors as they see fit (more precisely, it makes their allocation meaningless), and that it is therefore unconstitutional without the consent of Congress.[48]
Still, other legal scholars and experts, such as Maryland state senator Jamie Raskin, who co-sponsored the first NPVIC bill to be signed into law, see no legal conflict and count themselves among the compact's most ardent supporters. The compact's original proponents, Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar, are among the nation's top experts in constitutional law.[49] However, they did not write the compact and originally suggested to not call it a compact to avoid these kind of problems.[48] Of course, Congress could moot this question by consenting to the compact.

[edit] State-by-state legislative history
In the table below, the status of a bill is marked "pending" (in yellow) if the bill has not yet been brought to a vote, but the legislative session in which it was introduced has not yet been concluded.
Bills are only listed if they received a vote in at least one chamber or if they are still pending in the current session. The compact has been introduced in all states except Delaware and Idaho at least once, but was not always voted on.
