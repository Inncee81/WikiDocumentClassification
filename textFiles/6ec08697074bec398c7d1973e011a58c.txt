[edit] Biography
Tang showed an early interest in computers, beginning to learn Perl at age 12.[2] Two years later, Tang dropped out of high school, unable to adapt to student life.[1] By the year 2000, at the age of 19, Tang had already held positions in software companies, and worked in California's Silicon Valley as an entrepreneur.[2] In late 2005, she changed both her English and Chinese names from male to female ones and began to live her life as a woman, citing a need to "reconcile [her] outward appearance with [her] self-image".[3] Taiwan's Eastern Television reports that she has an IQ of 180.[1] She is a vocal proponent for autodidacticism[4] and individualist anarchism.[2]

[edit] Free software contributions
Tang is best known for initiating and leading the Pugs project, a joint effort from the Haskell and Perl communities to implement the Perl 6 language;[5] she has also made contributions to internationalization and localization efforts for several Free Software programs, including SVK, Request Tracker (for which she also wrote a large portion of the code) and Slash, as well as heading Traditional Chinese translation efforts for various Open Source-related books.[1][2]
On CPAN, Tang initiated over 100 Perl projects between June 2001 and July 2006, including the popular Perl Archive Toolkit (PAR), a cross-platform packaging and deployment tool for Perl 5.[6] She is also responsible for setting up smoke test and digital signature systems for CPAN.[7] In October 2005, she was a speaker at O'Reilly Media's European Open Source Convention in Amsterdam.[8]
