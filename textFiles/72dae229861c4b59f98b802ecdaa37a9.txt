Robin Hobb is the second pen name of novelist Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden (born 1952 in California) who produces primarily fantasy fiction, although she has published some science fiction.
From 1983 to 1992, she wrote exclusively under the pseudonym Megan Lindholm. Fiction under that pseudonym tends to be contemporary fantasy. In 1995, she began use of the pseudonym Robin Hobb for works of epic traditional European Medieval fantasy. She currently publishes under both names, and she currently lives in Tacoma, Washington. As of 2003 she had sold over 1 million copies of her first nine Robin Hobb novels.[1]. She has just finished writing a two volume novel called The Rain Wild Chronicles. The volumes are named Dragon Keeper, and Dragon Haven [2]

[edit] Background
Margaret was born in California in 1952, but was raised in Alaska.[3] After graduating high school she studied at Denver University for a year and then returned to Alaska. After marrying at eighteen she subsequently moved to Kodiak, an island off the coast of Alaska. It was at this time that she sold her first short story, and began a career writing for children's magazines. Bones for Dulath in AMAZONS! was the first piece of fantasy that she published as Megan Lindholm.[4] The anthology was published by Daw, edited by Jessica Amanda Salmonson, and won a World Fantasy Award for Year's Best Anthology. Over the next decade she moved around America, before settling in Washington and began writing fantasy and science fiction. She has three grown children and a young daughter.

[edit] As Robin Hobb

[edit] The Realm of the Elderlings

[edit] The Farseer Trilogy
The Farseer Trilogy follows the life of FitzChivalry Farseer (Fitz), a royal bastard and trained assassin, in a kingdom called The Six Duchies while his uncle, Prince Verity, attempts to wage war on the Red-Ship Raiders from The OutIslands who are attacking the shores of the kingdom by turning the populace (primarily the coastal people) into Forged ones; a form of zombification which makes them emotionless.

Royal Assassin (1996)
Assassin's Quest (1997)


[edit] Liveship Traders Trilogy
The Liveship Traders Trilogy mainly takes place southwest of The Six Duchies in Bingtown (a colony of Jamaillia) and focuses on Liveships (sentient ships). The trilogy is unusually nautical – an area seldom covered in fantasy – with the germ of it being apparently the idea of portraying ships whose figureheads are literally alive and sentient. While this trilogy does not follow FitzChivalry Farseer's life, it is linked to both the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies. Hobb is now working on a standalone novel set in the Rain Wilds, tentatively titled "Dragon Keeper".

[edit] The Tawny Man Trilogy
The Tawny Man continues the life of FitzChivalry Farseer from The Farseer Trilogy. It commences 15 years after the events in Assassin's Quest, a period covered by The Liveship Traders Trilogy. It focuses on The Fool's attempts to guide others to fulfill his prophecies.

[edit] Soldier Son Trilogy
Set in a new world unrelated to her previous trilogies, the Soldier Son Trilogy follows the life of Nevare Burvelle, the second son of a newly elevated Lord of the Kingdom of Gernia, and his preparation for and education at the King's Cavalla Academy.
