Apple — MacBook


The MacBook is a brand of Macintosh notebook computers by Apple Inc. First introduced in May 2006, it replaced the iBook and 12" PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of the Apple Intel transition. Part of the MacBook family, the MacBook is aimed at the education and consumer markets. It is the best-selling Macintosh in history, and according to the sales-research organization NPD Group in October 2008, the midrange model of the MacBook was the single best-selling laptop of any brand in U.S. retail stores for the preceeding five months.[1]
There are two designs of the MacBook: the first uses a polycarbonate casing that was modeled after the iBook G4, while the second uses a unibody aluminum casing. When the current MacBook was announced in October 2008, the original polycarbonate based MacBook was renamed 'MacBook White'. Aside from the name change, it received a standard SuperDrive, and later its chipset was updated to the same one used in the current MacBook model.

[edit] Polycarbonate model




The original MacBook in white


The original MacBook was released on May 16, 2006, and used the Intel Core Duo processor and 945GM chipset, with Intel's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a 667MHz front side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo processor and the GM 965 chipset, with Intel's X3100 integrated graphics on an 800MHz system bus.[2] An updated MacBook White with the same nVidia chipset found in the aluminum model was released in January 2009. However, the new model retains its DDR2 memory, whilst the aluminum uses DDR3.[3]
While thinner than the iBook G4 that it replaced, the MacBook was wider than the 12-inch model due to its widescreen display. In addition, the MacBook was the first to adopt Apple's MagSafe power connector and it replaced the iBook's mini-VGA display port with a mini-DVI display port. The iBook's discrete graphics chip was initially replaced by an integrated Intel GMA solution, though the latest MacBook White now uses a nVidia GeForce 9400M graphics solution.[3]

[edit] Design of Polycarbonate model
While the MacBook largely followed the industrial design standard set by the PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks: the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design, and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one that shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard shortcut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded virtual numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.[4]
Also offered in a more expensive black model until the introduction of the later aluminum MacBook, the polycarbonate MacBook was the only Macintosh notebook to be offered in more than one color since the iBook G3 (Clamshell).

[edit] User serviceability
The polycarbonate Intel MacBook is easier for users to fix or upgrade than its predecessor. Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access most internal components, including removal of the keyboard and RAM[5], users need only remove the polycarbonate MacBook's outer shell to access almost any interior component. Replacing the hard drive and memory requires merely the removal of the battery, and Apple provides do-it-yourself manuals for these tasks.[6]

[edit] Quality problems
Some early polycarbonate MacBook models suffered from include random shutdowns, which were resolved through software and firmware updates.[7]
There were also cases reported of discolored palmrests. In such cases, Apple asked affected owners to contact AppleCare.[8]

[edit] Aluminum Unibody model
Apple announced the new MacBook with its new Nvidia chipset on October 14, 2008, at a Cupertino press conference called "The Spotlight Turns To Notebooks". The chipset brought a 1066MHz system bus, use of DDR3 system memory, and integrated NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics that is up to five times faster than the Intel integrated graphics used by the white MacBook at the time of introduction.[21] Other changes include an LED backlit display, a new Mini DisplayPort (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button, removal of toxins such as mercury, and the removal of the FireWire 400 port (thus it doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system repairs without booting the system).[22]

[edit] Design of Aluminum Unibody model
The MacBook resembles the current MacBook Pro, but with smaller dimensions. It is thinner than the original polycarbonate based MacBooks and makes use of a unibody aluminum case with tapered edges. The keyboard of only the high-end model is backlit, like that of the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

[edit] Reviews
Although Gizmodo concluded it to be "our favorite MacBook to date," they did claim that its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, alleging a smaller viewing angle, washed-out colors, and dimmer backlighting.[23] Similarly AppleInsider and Engadget concluded that it "may well be Apple's best MacBook to date" and "these are terrific choices -- not only from an industrial design standpoint, but in specs as well" respectively, while also drawing attention to a lower quality display as compared with the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.[24][25] Charlie Sorrel of Wired News reached an identical conclusion about the MacBook display, citing its poor contrast and lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older white MacBook.[26] Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the FireWire port for Macworld, said "The absence of FireWire ports is certainly an inconvenience for some users. But it shouldn’t be considered a deal-breaker for most of us, anyway."[27]
