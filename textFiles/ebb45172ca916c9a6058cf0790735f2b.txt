orange - parliamentary republics
green - presidential republics, executive presidency linked to a parliament
yellow - presidential republics, semi-presidential system
blue - presidential republics, full presidential system
red - parliamentary constitutional monarchies in which the monarch does not personally exercise power
magenta - constitutional monarchies in which the monarch personally exercises power, often (but not always) alongside a weak parliament
purple - absolute monarchies
brown - republics where the dominant role of a single party is codified in the constitution
beige - states where constitutional provisions for government have been suspended
grey - countries which do not fit any of the above systems

Note that several states constitutionally deemed to be multiparty republics are broadly described by outsiders as authoritarian states. This chart aims to represent de jure form of government, not de facto degree of democracy. Those more interested in a version reflecting such judgments may be interested in seeing the map below from Freedom House.





Forms of government of states considered to be electoral democracies by Freedom House. States not considered to be electoral democracies are in gray.

[edit] Systems of Governance

[edit] Presidential/Separated republics
These are systems in which a president is the active head of the executive branch of government and is elected and remains in office independently of the legislature. The following list includes democratic and non-democratic states:

[edit] Full presidential systems
In full presidential systems, the president is both head of state and head of government. There is generally no prime minister, although if one exists he or she serves purely at the pleasure of the president. One country have at least vice-president that have an active role in the Government USA.

[edit] Parliamentary republics
A parliamentary republic is a system in which a prime minister is the active head of the executive branch of government and also leader of the legislature. The president's degree of executive power may range from being reasonably significant (e.g. Pakistan) to little or none at all (eg. Ireland). Where the president holds little executive power, their function is primarily that of a symbolic figurehead.

[edit] Notes


^ a b c While the office of prime minister exists, the president is both the head of state and government.
^ Collective presidency consisting of three members; one for each major ethnic group.
^ The SADR is a government in exile, located in Tindouf, Algeria. Most of the territory of Western Sahara is under military occupation by Morocco; the the rest is administered by the SADR.
^ In Bangladesh, a caretaker government during parliamentary elections. The Caretaker government is headed by a Chief Adviser and a group of neutral, non-partisan advisers chosen from the civil society. During this time, the president has jurisdiction over the defence and foreign affairs ministries.
^ a b Combines aspects of an executive presidency with a parliamentary system. The president is elected by parliament and holds a parliamentary seat, much like a prime minister.
^ Collective presidency consisting of two captains-regents from both major parties..
^ The President of Switzerland serves in a primus inter pares capacity amongst the Swiss Federal Council, the seven-member executive council which constitutes the government. The chancellor does not serve in the same capacity as the Austrian or German chancellors.
^ Norwegian Parliament web page [1]
^ CIA factbook on Norway [2]
^ Bishop of Urgell and President of France serve as ex-officio co-princes who are have their interests known through a representative.
^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p One of sixteen constitutional monarchies which recognize Elizabeth II as head of state, who presides over an independent government. She is titled separately in each country (e.g. Queen of Australia), and notionally appoints a Governor-General to each country other than the United Kingdom to act as her representative. The prime minister is the active head of the executive branch of government and also leader of the legislature. These countries may be known as "Commonwealth realms"
^ The UAE's constitution establishes the state as a federation of emirates, with the federal president drawn from hereditary emirs, but each emirate in turn functions as an absolute monarchy
^ Iran combines the forms of a presidential republic, with a president elected by universal suffrage; and a theocracy, with a Supreme Leader who is ultimately responsible for state policy, chosen by the elected Assembly of Experts. Candidates for both the Assembly of Experts and the presidency are vetted by the appointed Guardian Council.
