Kalarippayattu (Malayalam കളരിപയറ്റ്, Tamil: களரிபயத்து, pronounced [kaɭəɾipːajətːɨ̆]), is a Dravidian martial art from Kerala in south India. Possibly one of the oldest fighting systems in existence,[1] it is practiced in Kerala and contiguous parts of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka[2] as well as northeastern Sri Lanka and among the Indian community of Malaysia. The word is spelled variously as kalarippayatta, kalaripayattu, kalari payatt and many others depending on the dialect and romanisation system used. It includes strikes, kicks, grappling, preset forms, weaponry and healing techniques.[3] Regional variants of are classified according to geographical position in Kerala; these are the northern style of the Malayalese, the southern style of the Tamils and the central style from inner Kerala.

[edit] Etymology
The term kalari payattu is a tatpurusha compound from the words kalari (Malayalam:കളരി, Tamil:களரி) meaning school or gymnasium and payattu (Malayalam:പയററ്, Tamil:பயத்து) derived from payattuka meaning to "fight/ exercise" or "to put hard work into".
Belying the assumption that the compound itself might have an equally antique use as the singular kalari and payattu, the unpublished Malayalam Lexicon notes that the earliest use of the compound, kalarippayattu is in Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer's early twentieth century drama Amba when it is probable that the systems of martial practice assumed a structure and style akin those extant today. M.D. Raghavan has suggested that kalari was derived from the Sanskrit khalūrikā while Burrow is of the opinion that khalūrikā (parade ground, arena) and its Sanskrit root, khala- (threshing floor) are Dravidian loan words.

[edit] History




South Indian state of Kerala, where kalari payat originated



[edit] Origins
Main article: Origins of Kalarippayattu
The word "kalari" can be traced to ancient Sangam literature.[4] But according to Dick Luijendijk, a researcher at the university of Nijmegen, in this context the word does not refer to any martial act.[5] But because the Sangam literature is mainly about love-making and fighting among the South Indian nobility, it is possible to see kalari payat as a continuation of earlier traditions.[5] Thus the martial tradition of kalari payat is also dated to ancient Dravidian traditions.[6]
It is generally believed that systemised kalari payat originated in northern Kerala and spread to the Tamil-dominant south where it is closely linked to the stick-fighting style of silambam. Kalari payat became more developed during the 9th century and was practiced by a section of the Nair community, warrior clan of Kerala, to defend the state and the king. The ancient warrior spirit was also retained throughout the centuries by the warrior chieftains of ancient Kerala known as the Mamanka Chekavars and the Lohars, the Buddhist warriors of north Kerala[7].
Phillip Zarrilli, a professor at the University of Exeter and one of the few Western authorities on kalari payat, estimates that the art dates back to at least the 12th century CE.[3] The historian Elamkulam Kunjan Pillai attributes the birth of kalari payat to an extended period of warfare between the Cheras and the Cholas in the 11th century CE.[3] The oldest western reference to the style is the 16th century travelogue of Duarte Barbosa, a Portuguese explorer.
Because it was taught without gender restrictions, kalari payat is said to have eventually become as prevalent as reading and writing. Some of its choreographed sparring can be applied to dance[8] and kathakali dancers who knew martial arts were believed to be markedly better than the other performers. Even today some traditional Indian dance schools incorporate kalari payat as part of their exercise regimen.[5]

[edit] Decline and revival
Main article: Revival of Kalarippayattu
Kalari payat underwent a period of decline when the Nairs lost to the British after the introduction of firearms and especially after the full establishment of British colonial rule in the 19th century.[3] The resurgence of public interest in kalari payat began in the 1920s in Tellicherry as part of a wave of rediscovery of the traditional arts throughout south India[3] and continued through the 1970s surge of general worldwide interest in martial arts.[9] In recent years, efforts have been made to further popularise the art, with it featuring in international and Indian films such as Indian (1996), Asoka (2001), The Myth (2005) and The Last Legion (2007).

[edit] Regional variations
There are several styles of kalari payat. The three main schools of thought can be distinguished by their attacking and defensive patterns. The best introduction to the differences between these styles is the book of Luijendijk which uses photographs to show several kalari payat exercises and their applications. Each chapter in his book references a representative of each of the three main traditions.[10]

[edit] Northern style
Main article: Northern Kalaripayattu
Northern kalari payat was practiced primarily by Nairs and Thiyyas (Chekavars) and is focused mainly in the northern Malabar region of Kozhikode and Kannur.[3] It places comparatively more emphasis on weapons than on empty hands.[3] Parasurama, sixth avatar of Vishnu, is believed to be the style's founder according to both oral and written tradition.[3] Masters in this system are usually known as gurukkal (or occasionally as asan), and were often given honorific titles, especially Panikkar.[3]
The northern style is distinguished by its meippayattu - physical training and use of full-body oil massage.[3] The system of treatment and massage, and the assumptions about practice are closely associated with ayurveda.[3] The purpose of medicinal oil massage is to increase the practitioners' flexibility, to treat muscle injuries incurred during practice, or when a patient has problems related to the bone tissue, the muscles, or nerve system. The term for such massages is thirumal and the massage specifically for physical flexibility chavutti thirumal...which literally means "stamping massage" or "foot massage". The masseuse may use his/ her feet and weight of the body to massage the person.
There are several lineages (sampradayam), of which the arappukai is the most common nowadays. There are schools which teach more than one of these traditions. Some traditional kalari around Kannur for example teach a blend of arappukai, pillatanni, and katadanath styles.[10]

[edit] Southern style
Main article: Southern Kalaripayattu

Southern kalari payat was practised mainly in old Travancore including the present Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu[3] primarily by Nadars and a section of Nairs and Ezhavas in Kerala.[3] It emphasises empty hand techniques.[3] The founder and patron saint is believed to be the rishi Agasthya rather than Parasurama.[3] Masters are known as 'asaan rather than gurukkal.[3] The stages of training are chuvatu (solo forms), jodi (partner training/sparring), kurunthadi (short stick), neduvadi (long stick), katthi (knife), katara (dagger), valum parichayum (sword and shield), chuttuval (flexible sword), double sword, kalari grappling and marmma (pressure points).[11]
Zarrilli refers to southern kalari payat as varma ati (the law of hitting), marma ati (hitting the vital spots) or varma kalai (art of varma).[3] The preliminary empty handed techniques of varma ati are known as adithada (hit/defend).[3] Marma ati refers specifically to the application of these techniques to vital spots.[3] Weapons include bamboo staves, short sticks, and the double deer horns.[3] Southern styles of kalaripayat are not usually practiced in special roofed pits but rather in the open air or in an unroofed enclosure of palm branches.[3]
Medical treatment in the southern styles is identified with siddha,[9] the traditional Dravidian system of medicine distinct from north Indian ayurveda. The siddha medical system, otherwise known as siddha vaidyam, is also attributed to Agasthya.
Closely related to southern kalari payat is silambam, the Tamil art of stick fighting. It supposedly originated in the Kurinji hills of Kerala 5000 years ago where natives were using bamboo staves to defend themselves against wild animals. "Salambal" is a common word used to denote the sound of fast flowing rivers/springs, the chirping noises of birds, the murmur of leaves, the noise created by a talking crowd, the whooshing, whirring and clanging sound of weapons etc. When long sticks, swords and chain flails are used they produce the "sala sala" sound which is called salambal. Thus silambam became the name of the martial art that uses long sticks, swords etc.

[edit] Central style
Main article: Central Kalaripayattu
Central kalari payat is practiced mainly in Thrissur, Malappuram, Palakkad and certain parts of Ernakulam districts.[3] It is a composite of the northern and southern styles that includes northern meippayattu preliminary exercises, southern emphasis on empty-handed moves and its own distinctive techniques which are performed within floor drawings known as kalam.[3]

[edit] Training




Gurukkal praying before puttara CVN Kalari, Ettumanoor


Several componenents make up the basic equipment and training ground of kalari payat. Students begin training at approximately seven years old with a formal initiation ritual performed by the gurukkal.

[edit] Initiation ceremony
At the age of seven, on the opening day of the new session, a novice (mostly Nairs in the olden days) is admitted to the kalari in the presence of the gurukkal or a senior student and directed to place his right foot first across the threshold. The student touches the ground with the right hand and then his forehead, as a sign of respect. He is then led to the guruthara, the place where a lamp is kept burning in reverence to all the masters of the kalari, to repeat his act of worship. He then offers the master some money as dakshina in folded betel leaves and prostrates himself, touching the master's feet as a sign of submission. The guru then places his hands on the pupil’s head, blesses him and prays for him. This worship-touching the ground, puttara, guruthara and the guru’s feet-is repeated everyday. It symbolizes a complete submission to and acceptance of the kalari deities, kalari gurukkal, and the rules and discipline of the art.

[edit] The Kalari
Main article: Kalari
The kalari is a specially constructed practicing area that comprises a puttara (seven tiered platform) in the south-west corner. The guardian deity (usually an avatar of Bhagavathi or Shiva) is located here, and is worshipped with flowers, incense and water before each practising session, which is preceded by a prayer.

[edit] Stages




Ankathari in which both opponents are armed with chuttuval and paricha


Training is mainly divided into four parts consisting of Meithari, Kolthari, Ankathari and Verumkai.


[edit] Meithari (മെയ്ത്താരി)
Meithari is the beginning stage with rigorous body sequences involving twists, stances and complex jumps and turns. Twelve meippayattu exercises for neuro-muscular coordination, balance and flexibility follow the basic postures of the body. Kalari payat originates not in aggression but is in the disciplining of the self. Therefore the training begins with disciplining the physical body and attaining a mental balance. This is crucial for any person and not necessarily a martial aspirant. This first stage of training consists of physical exercises to develop strength, flexibility, balance and stamina. It includes jumps, low stances on the floor, circular sequences, kicks etc. An attempt is made to understand and master each separate organ of the body. These exercises bring an alertness to the mind, and this alertness helps one understand some of the movements and processes of the self defense sequences that are taught at later stages.

[edit] Kolthari (കോല്തരി)




Kolthari


Once the student has become physically competent, he/she is introduced to fighting with long wooden weapons. The first weapon taught is the staff (kettukari), which is usually five feet (1.5 m) in length, or up to the forehead of the student from ground level. The second weapon taught is the cheruvadi or muchan, a wooden stick three palm spans long, about two and a half feet long or 75 cm. The third weapon taught is the otta, a wooden stick curved to resemble the trunk of an elephant. The tip is rounded and is used to strike the vital spots in the opponent's body. This weapon is considered the master weapon, and is the fundamental tool of practice to develop stamina, agility, power, and skill. Otta training consists of 18 sequences.

[edit] Ankathari (അങ്കത്തരി)
Once the practitioner has become proficient with all the wooden weapons, he/she proceeds to Ankathari (literally "war training") starting with metal weapons, which require superior concentration due to their lethal nature. The first metal weapon taught is the kadhara, a metal dagger with a curved blade. Taught next are the sword (val) and shield (paricha). Subsequent weapons include the spear (kuntham) and the flexible sword (urumi or chuttuval), an extremely dangerous weapon taught to only the most skillful students. Historically, after the completion of 'Ankathari', the student would specialize in a weapon of his choice, for example to become an expert swordsman or stick fighter.

[edit] Verumkai (വെറുംകൈ)
Only after achieving mastery with all the weapon forms is the practitioner taught to defend his/her person with bare-handed techniques. These include arm locks, grappling, and strikes to the pressure points (marmam). This is considered the most advanced martial skill so the gurukkal restricts knowledge of marmam only to very few students whom he trusts.

[edit] Marmashastram and massage




Kalari payat practitioners usually meditate to invoke inner energy.


Main article: Marmam
It is claimed that learned warriors can disable or kill their opponents by merely touching the correct marmam (vital point). This is taught only to the most promising and level-headed persons, to discourage misuse of the technique. Marmashastram stresses on the knowledge of marmam and is also used for marma treatment (marmachikitsa). This system of marma treatment comes under sidha vaidhyam, attributed to the sage Agasthya and his disciples. Critics of kalari payat have pointed out that the application of marmam techniques against neutral outsiders has not always produced verifiable results
The earliest mention of marmam is found in the Rig Veda where Indra is said to have defeated Vritra by attacking his marman with a vajra.[12] References to marman also found in the Atharva Veda.[13] With numerous other scattered references to vital points in Vedic and epic sources, it is certain that India's early martial artists knew about and practised attacking or defending vital points.[14] Sushruta (c. 6th century BC) identified and defined 107 vital points of the human body in his Sushruta Samhita.[15] Of these 107 points, 64 were classified as being lethal if properly struck with a fist or stick.[16] Sushruta's work formed the basis of the medical discipline ayurveda, which was taught alongside various Indian martial arts that had an emphasis on vital points, such as Varma Kalai and Marma Adi.[16]
As a result of learning about the human body, Indian martial artists became knowledgable in the field of traditional medicine and massage. Kalari payat teachers often provide massages (Malayalam: uzhichil) with medicinal oils to their students in order to increase their physical flexibility or to treat muscle injuries encountered during practice. Such massages are generally termed thirumal and the unique massage given to increase flexibility is known as katcha thirumal. It is said to be as sophisticated as the uzhichil treatment of ayurveda. Kalari payat has borrowed extensively from ayurveda and equally lends to it (see Ayurveda and Kalari ).

[edit] Techniques
Main article: Kalaripayattu Techniques
Techniques (atavu) in kalari payat are a combination of steps (chuvatu) and postures (vadivu). There are five steps and northern styles have ten postures (Ashta Vadivukal).
