Nana (ナナ ?) is a Japanese shōjo manga series written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa, serialised in Cookie published by Shueisha. There is an anime adaptation, as well as two live-action films. The first twelve volumes of the manga series have cumulatively sold over 22 million copies.[1]As in 2005, it has sold over 34,500,000 making it the fourth best selling shōjo manga worldwide.[2] The manga derives its title from the name of the two main characters, both of whom are called Nana. What sets them apart, however, is the stark difference between their lives. One Nana comes from a small town, following along with her friends and boyfriend to Tokyo with the hope of having the dream life that she wishes for. The other Nana, on the other side, comes to Tokyo with the goal of making it big with her band, Black Stones. The two Nanas are brought together in what has become a major success for Ai Yazawa and the shōjo genre.[citation needed]
Nana is presently being released in North America by Viz Media. It ended its serialization in the August 2007 issue of Shojo Beat and was replaced by Honey and Clover. It will continue, however, to be released in tankōbon (graphic novel format).[3] The manga has also been adapted into a highly successful live-action film with a sequel released on December 9, 2006, and an anime adaptation that premiered on April 5, 2006. The anime adaptation has subsequently been announced as licensed for release in North America by Viz Media.[4] In 2003, the manga won the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōjo.[5]
As of March 10, 2009, there are 15 volumes available in English in the United States, with a 16th volume set to be released on May 5, 2009.

[edit] Plot synopsis
Nana Osaki is a punk singer who wants to debut with her band Black Stones (BLAST for short). Nana was the lead vocalist in their old band with her boyfriend, Ren, and they lived together as lovers since she was 15. When Ren is offered a chance to debut in Tokyo as a replacement member of the popular band Trapnest (Taranesu in Japanese), Nana chooses to cultivate her own band after Ren leaves her and Black Stones for Trapnest. Has too much pride to just follow Ren to Tokyo and happily be a rockstar's girlfriend, she stays behind. She leaves for Tokyo at the age of twenty, and to start her musical career.
Nana Komatsu, the other Nana, is called with the nickname Hachi (after Hachikō) as she has weak mental characteristics that resemble a puppy. With a habit of falling in love at first sight all the time, Hachi has always depended on other people to help her. When her friends and then boyfriend leave for Tokyo, she decides to join them a year later after having saved enough money at the age of 20.
Nana and Hachi meet in a train by chance, both on their way to Tokyo. After a string of coincidences, they come to live together in an apartment numbered 707. Despite having contrasting characters and ideals, the Nanas like and respect each other.
While the Black Stones begin to gain popularity at live gigs, other issues need resolving, especially in the areas of romance. The story of Nana revolves heavily on the romance and relationships of the two characters as one seeks fame and recognition while the other seeks love and happiness.

[edit] Characters
Main article: List of Nana characters
Nana Osaki is a punk-rock singer with a style to match, and Nana Komatsu, also known as Hachi, a small-town girl who moves to Tokyo to start a new life. They meet on a train, and their destinies are sealed. Viz Media, the English translator of the manga, often refers to the girls as "Nana O." and "Nana K." because in the Japanese manga the girls' names were spelled using different characters, making it easier to determine which Nana people were talking about.
The characters in Nana have complex personalities and their own histories, which sometimes intertwine with one another. The importance of each character grows in the manga as the story progresses to many dramatic heights and falls. The two main characters in particular, Nana O. and Nana K., support each other greatly, as evidenced both in the story and in the narration, which is done by either Nana at the beginning and end of each volume.
Other important characters include Hachi's friends and ex-boyfriend, who she followed from her hometown to Tokyo, the members of Nana O.'s band (Black Stones), and the members of the band Trapnest.

[edit] Film




Nana the movie


Main article: Nana (2005 film)
Nana has been made into a film which was released on September 3, 2005. The film stars Mika Nakashima as the punk star Nana Osaki, and Aoi Miyazaki as Hachi (Nana Komatsu). The DVD edition was released on March 3, 2006. The film did quite well at the Japanese box office, grossing more than 4 billion yen, staying in the top 10 for several weeks.

[edit] Main cast

Nana Osaki: Mika Nakashima
Nana Komatsu (Hachi): Aoi Miyazaki


[edit] Theme songs
In addition to creating a Nana craze throughout Asia, the film also helped launch Mika Nakashima to the peak of her career as she released the single "Glamorous Sky" under the name Nana starring Mika Nakashima. The single created topicality with its special collaboration between Nakashima, Hyde (who wrote the song), and Nana author Yazawa Ai (who wrote the lyrics). The single became Nakashima's first number one single on the Oricon Charts.
The film also helped promote another artist, Yuna Ito, who starred in the film as Trapnest vocal Reira, released her debut single "Endless Story," the insert song of the film, under the name Reira starring Yuna Ito. The single ranked second on the Oricon charts, next to Nakashima's "Glamorous Sky," and made Yuna Ito one of the most successful debuting artists of 2005.

[edit] Film sequel




Nana 2


Main article: Nana 2
Nana 2, the sequel to the first film, was announced right after the first debuted. However, on August 4, 2006, Toho stated that shooting would begin mid-September and that the film was to be released on December 9, 2006. Aoi Miyazaki and Ryuhei Matsuda would not be reprising their respective roles as Nana Komatsu and Ren Honjo; as such, their roles were assigned to Yui Ichikawa and Nobuo Kyou, respectively [1].
Two new singles were released under Nana starring Mika Nakashima and Reira starring Yuna Ito.
However, the sequel was a let-down for fans and company, it only peaked #4 at the Japanese Movie Rankings, and had much more bad press than any good.
The film had its international premiere in New York City on December 15, 2006. It opened for a single showing at the IFC. Both Mika Nakashima and Yui Ichikawa were present.

[edit] Main cast

Nana Komatsu: Yui Ichikawa
Nana Osaki: Mika Nakashima
Ren Honjo: Nobuo Kyou
Takumi Ichinose: Tetsuji Tamayama
Shinichi "Shin" Okazaki: Hongo Kanata
Nobuo "Nobu" Terashima: Hiroki Narimiya
Reira Serizawa: Yuna Ito


[edit] Theme songs
Nana 2 once again featured the two artists Mika Nakashima and Yuna Ito, releasing songs under the names Nana starring Mika Nakashima and Reira starring Yuna Ito, respectively.
Nana, starring Mika Nakashima's new single "Hitoiro" featured Takuro of Glay as composer and Nana author Yazawa Ai as the lyricist again. It did not do as well as its predecessor "Glamorous Sky," peaking at only #5 on the Oricon charts. Two weeks after the release of the single, however, Nana starring Mika Nakashima released her first and last album, The End, which managed to rank at #2 on the Oricon charts.
Reira, starring Yuna Ito's "Truth" had no more luck than Nakashima's new single, ranking in only at the tenth place on the Oricon charts. The music video of the single was filmed in Scotland and used as scenes of the film. Neither singles were as record-setting as their predecessors.

[edit] Anime
See also: List of Nana episodes
Nana has been adapted into an anime series, directed by Morio Asaka and animated by the studio Madhouse. The first opening and third ending songs are sung by Anna Tsuchiya for the band Black Stones, and Olivia sings the second opening and first and second endings for the band Trapnest as Reira Serizawa. The first DVD release was on 2006-07-07. The anime series was intended to be equal to the manga and it was adapted until the 12th tankoubon to avoid original anime fillers. According to Junko Koseki (editor of Nana in Shueisha) and Masao Maruyama (president of Madhouse) a second season is probably going to be aired once the manga series is finished.[6]

[edit] CD releases
As with the film Nana, the anime helped promote two artists, Olivia and Anna Tsuchiya. In addition to their respective singles, there have also been several albums released for the anime. These releases did not fare as well as the film-related releases.

Two versions of Nana 707 were released - a limited edition which comes in the form of a hardcover book containing stills from the series plus 7 postcards, and a regular version.
A special compilation album featuring the combined works of Anna Tsuchiya and OLIVIA titled Nana Best was released on March 21, 2007. This album consists of the 14 songs that are featured in the anime. The first press limited edition version comes in deluxe packaging with a DVD featuring special Nana video material.

[edit] Trivia





Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or articles. (July 2007)



It is widely believed that Nana Osaki's characters, including her facial feature, are based on the real-life female singer Nanase Aikawa, who was active during the 1990s.
"Hachikō" is the name of a famous dog in Japan. Additionally, "hachi" is the word for "eight" in Japanese, while "nana" is the word for "seven".
The surnames of the 2 Nanas may have been chosen to give their "seniority"; the Ō (大) in Ōsaki's surname means "big", while Ko (小) in Komatsu's means "small".
The seiyū who voiced Hachi in the PS2 game (Rumi Shishido) also had a cameo role as Hachi's bad tempered superior at the publisher's in the first live-action film. She also was the seiyū of Gokinjo Monogatari's Kouda Mikako, another Yazawa Ai title.
The Black Stones name is derived from the cigarettes smoked habitually by Yasu and Shin, named Black Stone, this is a picture of the actual packaging.
Happy Berry, the clothing line of Gokinjo Monogatari's protagonist Kouda Mikako, can be seen in various scenes in Nana (as well as sudosaurus for Tenshi Nanka Ja Nai, Paradise Kiss and Gokinjo Monogatari).
Various brands are shown quite openly in the series, including Vivienne Westwood clothing, an Apple Powerbook, Fender and Gibson guitars/basses and various real cigarette brands such as Gitanes, Seven Star and Black Stone.
The series takes place around 2001 as indicated by the date on the Trapnest Trigger Tour ticket given to Nana Komatsu early on in the series and later on at the signs of the upcoming television show.
Volumes 19 and 20 were the third and fifth highest selling (respectively) tankobon manga books of 2008.[7]
