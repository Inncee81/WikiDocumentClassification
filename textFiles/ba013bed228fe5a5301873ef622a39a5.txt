M83 is an electronic music act consisting of Anthony Gonzalez (and formerly Nicolas Fromageau), and was formed in Antibes, France in 2001. The musical style owes something to the shoegazing genre in its extensive use of reverb effects and lyrics spoken softly over loud instrumentals, though M83's songs employ considerably less guitar than most shoegazing bands. For the third album released by M83, Before the Dawn Heals Us, Gonzalez decided to part from Fromageau (after an emotionally distressing tour for Dead Cities, involving members of the rock band Eon Megahertz) and record mainly on his own, with the help of a few other musicians.

[edit] Songs and album history
M83 produced the remix of the track "Pioneers" on British group Bloc Party's 2005 album Silent Alarm Remixed. They have also remixed Placebo's "Protège-Moi", Goldfrapp's "Black Cherry", Depeche Mode's "Suffer Well" and Bumblebeez 81's "Vila Attack". Similarly, M83's songs have been remixed by Gooom labelmates Montag and Cyann & Ben.
In 2005, M83 also reissued their 2001 self-titled album. This was made available in the United States, unlike the 2001 release.
In 2006, after the Before the Dawn Heals Us US tour, Anthony Gonzalez continued to explore a musical direction already heard on earlier M83 tracks and began writing and recording a collection of ambient works. The album was recorded primarily at his home studio with the assistance of Antoine Gaillet. The resulting project is called Digital Shades Volume 1 and was released on September 3, 2007. It is intended to be part of an ongoing series of ambient works.
Saturdays = Youth, M83's fifth studio album was released on April 15, 2008 on Mute Records. It was recorded with Ken Thomas (known for his work with Sigur Rós, The Sugarcubes, Boys in a Band, Cocteau Twins and Suede), Ewan Pearson (who has also produced for Tracey Thorn, The Rapture and Ladytron) and Morgan Kibby (of The Romanovs) The album is said to deliver the rich sonic textures for which M83 is well known, but with a more focused approach to song structure and form. "Couleurs" was the first single from the new album, released to digital retailers on February 25, 2008. The album's second single, "Graveyard Girl," was released to digital retailers on April 8, 2008 and comes with an exclusive remix from Yuksek.
In 2008, they supported Kings of Leon on their UK tour. In 2009, they will support Depeche Mode in their stadium "Tour of the Universe" in April / May / June in Germany and France. [1] and they will tour with The Killers and play the V Festival tour around Australia.
