The Prophecy of the Popes, attributed to Saint Malachy, is a list of 112 short phrases in Latin. They purport to describe each of the Roman Catholic popes (along with a few anti-popes), beginning with Pope Celestine II (elected in 1143) and concluding with a later added pope described in the prophecy as "Peter the Roman", whose pontificate will end in the destruction of the city of Rome.

[edit] Provenance
The prophecy was first published in 1595 by Arnold de Wyon, a Benedictine historian, as part of his book Lignum Vitæ. Wyon attributed the list to Saint Malachy, the 12th‑century bishop of Armagh in Ireland. According to the traditional account, in 1139, Malachy was summoned to Rome by Pope Innocent II. While in Rome, Malachy purportedly experienced a vision of future popes, which he recorded as a sequence of cryptic phrases. This manuscript was then deposited in the Roman Archive, and thereafter forgotten about until its rediscovery in 1590.
On the other hand, Bernard of Clairvaux's biography of Malachy makes no mention of the prophecy, nor is it mentioned in any record prior to its 1595 publication.[citation needed] Some sources, including the most recent editions of the Catholic Encyclopedia, suggest that the prophecy is a late 16th‑century forgery. Some have suggested that it was created by Nostradamus and was credited to Saint Malachy so the purported seer would not be blamed for the destruction of the papacy. Supporters, such as author John Hogue, who wrote a popular book titled The Last Pope about the claims, generally argue that even if the author of the prophecies is uncertain, the predictions are still valid. There seems to be no indication that the papers were in fact a forgery except for the wild inaccuracies and reaching attributions of the later predictions when compared to earlier ones, assuming a 1580-1590 creation date.[citation needed]

[edit] Skepticism and authenticity
Skepticism of the prophecy's authenticity is from the general vagueness of each papal motto, leading to multiple interpretations, and that the prophecy's mottos fit the earlier popes much better than they do those elected after the document's first publication. Such similarities as exist between the later popes and their mottoes can be seen as a product of coincidence and the mottoes' vagueness; that is to say, these later prophecies are susceptible to a confirmation bias.
For example, the association of John Paul II with the motto De labore Solis ("the Sun's labor"), allegedly due to his birth and funeral both occurring at times of solar eclipse ("labores solis"), can be seen, erroneously, as a statistically likely post-diction, as various types of eclipses occur two or more times each year. However, solar eclipses, to which the prophecy referred, are much rarer occurring about every two years on average. Moreover, solar eclipses are only infrequently visible from a specific site more than once. Indeed, on average, it takes almost four hundred years for a solar eclipse to be visible again from the same spot on the Earth.
Another example of the questioned authority of the prophecy is Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger's choice of the name Benedict XVI, which was seen by some as the fulfilment the prophecy De Gloria Olivae, since it is claimed that the olive branch is sometimes used as a symbol of St. Benedict. However, prior to his election there were numerous speculations in the media as to what could be considered as "fulfillment of the prophecy". For example, it was said that any pope from the Benedictine Order; or any Latin American pope (with olive complexion) or any black pope; or any pope from Italy or Spain (two countries strongly associated with the cultivation of olives); or any pope with links to Judaism—any of the aforementioned possibilities was advanced as constituting a fulfillment of the prophecy, giving a broad array of possibilities. It has also been noted that the choice of name, while interesting for those who predicted the choice of the name, was not statistically unlikely, as modern papal names are generally chosen from a fairly limited set of names. In the last 250 years, for example, there have only been seven names used for Popes: John, Benedict, Pius, Gregory, Paul, Leo, and John Paul. Media comments on Pope Benedict XVI's choice of name have suggested that he seeks to emulate Pope Benedict XV's legacy of diplomacy and theological conservatism.
Separate doubts are raised about the last entry, describing Petrus Romanus. Some claim that this was first recorded sometime after 1820 and so is often considered not to be part of the original prophecy.

[edit] Interpretation
Interpretation of the mottos has generally relied on finding correspondences between the mottos and the popes' birthplaces, their personal arms, and the events of their pontificates. For example, the first motto, Ex castro Tiberis (From a castle on the Tiber), fits Pope Celestine II's birthplace in Città di Castello, on the Tiber. Pope Clement XIII, referred to in the prophecy Rosa Umbriae, the rose of Umbria, who is stated to have used a rose "as his personal emblem" (his coat of arms does not include one, however, nor was he from Umbria nor had any but the most marginal connection with the region, having been briefly pontifical governor of Rieti, at the time part of Umbria). The technique of word play was evident in instances where interpreters find a phrase fitting more than one explanation.
In recent times, some interpreters of prophetic literature have drawn attention to the prophecies, both because of their success in finding connections between the prophecies and recent popes, and because of the prophecies' imminent conclusion. Interpretations made before the elections of recent popes have generally turned out not to predict their papacies accurately.

[edit] Popes and corresponding mottos
This list, adapted from The Prophecies of St. Malachy by Peter Bander, begins its numbering two numbers ahead of the Vatican's numbering of popes (Benedict XVI is the 265th, not the 267th). The reason for this is unclear. (perhaps because of the 2 purported "anti-popes")

(In extreme persecution, the seat of the Holy Roman Church will be occupied by Peter the Roman, who will feed the sheep through many tribulations; when they are over, the city of seven hills will be destroyed, and the terrible or fearsome Judge will judge his people. The End.) Most scholars believe that this prophecy was added at a later date. It can be noted that this pope had explicitly not been numbered (as he would have been #112)
See below




[edit] Contemporary Popes and the Prophecy

[edit] Pope Pius IX (Crux de Cruce)

Cross of the Cross. His successor Pope Pius XII renewed the beatification process for Pius IX, commenting with the words, per crucem ad lucem, through the cross to light. Pius IX was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2000.

[edit] Pope Pius X (Ignis Ardens)

The motto means "ardent" or "burning fire". The pope was known for his great personal piety and strong devotion to the church, advocating reforms such as the codification of Canon law, daily communion and the Gregorian chant in the Catholic liturgy. He was known for his zeal in fighting the modernist heresy. He has been the first pope to date in over 400 years to be declared a saint, the last being Pope Pius V.

[edit] Pope Benedict XV (Religio Depopulata)

The motto means "religion laid waste". During Pope Benedict XV's reign, three significant events occurred:

World War I, which killed 20 million people in Europe,
Spanish flu, the 1918 flu pandemic which killed 50-100 million people worldwide
the October Revolution in Russia, which established the atheist Soviet Union.


[edit] Pope Pius XI (Fides Intrepida)

The motto means "intrepid faith". This pope released the encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge which condemned Nazi racism and also signed agreements with Fascist Italy which, among other things, gave the Vatican sovereignty, established the pope as head of state, and added 700 million lire to the church coffers.

[edit] Pope Pius XII (Pastor Angelicus)

The motto means "an angelic shepherd". This pope was known to be very mystical, and it was believed that he received visions. His writings added greatly to understanding of Catholic beliefs and church doctrine. During his reign, Pius exercised Papal Infallibility in defining dogma when he issued, on November 1, 1950 an apostolic constitution, Munificentissimus Deus, which defines ex cathedra the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into heaven, on the request of the heavenly father. He was declared Venerable in 2000.

[edit] Pope John XXIII (Pastor et Nauta)

"Pastor et Nauta" translates to "Shepherd and Sailor". Prior to his election he was patriarch of Venice, which is a maritime city, famous for its waterways and gondolas.
According to Peter Bander in The Prophecies of Malachy, during the conclave which was to elect John XXIII, Cardinal Spellman, evidently having taken Malachy's forecast that the next pope would be "pastor and mariner" literally, rented a boat, filled it with sheep and sailed up and down the Tiber.
The anti-pope Pius XIII of the True Catholic Church has also claimed to be "Pastor et Nauta", as their group believes that his last valid predecessor was Pius XII. He has used justifications including his residence in the United States, which is across the Atlantic Ocean from Rome.

[edit] Pope Paul VI (Flos Florum)

Pope Paul VI, is described in the prophecies as "Flos Florum" or "Flower of Flowers". His personal arms bore three fleurs-de-lis, the heraldic charge best known as that in the arms of the French monarchy. Fleur-de-lis literally means "flower of the lily": yet the medieval flower par excellence was the rose[citation needed], not the lily; and many popes have borne various flowers in their arms.
The fleur-de-lys has the meaning of purity and chastity in Catholic religion. This is based upon scripture. Paul VI published his encyclical Humanæ Vitæ subtitled On the Regulation of Birth, on July 25, 1968. In this encyclical he reaffirmed the Catholic Church's traditional condemnation of artificial birth control.

[edit] Pope John Paul I (De Medietate Lunae)

"De Medietate Lunae" translates to "of the half-moon". It could also be interpreted as "De Media Aetate Lunae", meaning "of the average age of the moon".

Albino Luciani, who later became Pope John Paul I, was born in Canale d'Agordo, diocese of Belluno, which name is similar to bella luna or beautiful moon.


He was elected on August 26, 1978, the day after the moon reached its last quarter, and reigned for 33 days, approximately five days longer than a lunar cycle. He died the day before the new moon.


However, a much simpler explanation might be that he was born on the day of the half moon: on October 17, 1912, the moon was in its first quarter.


Others point to his name before becoming pope, Albino Luciani. Albino is related to "albus", white, and "Luciani", derived from "Lucius", is ultimately related to the Latin word lux "light", whence "white light". Still others have linked "half-moon" to the smile often exhibited by John Paul I, who is remembered by many as the "smiling Pope."


[edit] Pope John Paul II (De Labore Solis)

The prophetic motto corresponding to Pope John Paul II is "De labore Solis", which literally means "Of the Labour of The Sun". But "labores solis" or "travails of the sun" is a common metaphor used to mean solar eclipse.
There are a variety of explanations that have been given to explain the motto:

Karol Jozef Wojtyła, who later became Pope John Paul II, was born on 18 May 1920, the day of a partial solar eclipse over the Indian Ocean, and buried on 8 April 2005, the day of a rare hybrid eclipse over the south-western Pacific and South America.


During World War II, Karol Wojtyła worked in a quarry, "laboring in the sunlight".


It might also be seen to be the fruit of the intercession of the "Woman Clothed with the Sun labouring" in the Book of Revelation 12, because of his devotion to the Virgin Mary, to whose intercession he credited surviving an assassination attempt early in his papacy.
Also, he affirmed the importance of the reported messages of the Virgin Mary at Fatima, which had as its confirming event, the strange "solar eclipse" or "sun spinning in the sky" event, reported in the secular media in 1917.


It has also been suggested that the associated Latin phrase could also be an anagram for "de borealis sol" (correct Latin: de boreali sol) or "a Sun from the North", being a luminary coming from Poland which is north of Rome.


Another interpretation points simply to the sun rising in the east and his being the first Pope from Eastern Europe.


A further theory is that the combination of "labore" and "solis" cryptically refers to "the sun of the workers", i.e., "the star of communism", with John Paul being the only pope to have spent much of his life under a communist regime.


Yet another theory exists among some traditionalist Catholics, who believe that the motto translates as "Eclipse of the Sun". These Catholics view the Second Vatican Council as a fundamental departure of the Catholic faith. and that the differences between the church before and after the council are stark enough to regard the contemporary official Catholic Church as a new modernist church and not truly Catholic. The sun is so interpreted as the true Catholic faith, which has been eclipsed by the heterodoxy of the council teachings. They identify this time period as the Great Apostasy, that has been predicted for the End of Times.


Nicolas Copernicus (who studied at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland) was the first to present the heliocentric theory, later presented by Galileo. Between 1990 and 2000, the Papacy apologized for the Galileo Trials. Thus, the 'Labor of the Sun' was first presented by a Polish-born astronomer, and corrected by the Polish-born Pope.


John Paul II introduced the Mysteries of Light to the Rosary.


During his pontificate, John Paul II traveled extensively all around the world, more than any other pope before, and similarly to what the sun does daily, from an earth-centric point of view.[74]


[edit] Pope Benedict XVI (De Gloria Olivae)

"De Gloria Olivae" or "glory of the olive", is the next phrase following "De labore Solis".

Prior to the papal conclave, this motto led to speculation that the next pontiff would be from the Order of Saint Benedict, whose symbols include the olive branch.


Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, elected in April 2005, is not a Benedictine, but did choose Benedict XVI as his regnal name, partially named after Benedictine founder Benedict of Nursia), which might be regarded as a fulfillment of this prophecy.


By choosing the name Benedict, the Pope became linked with St. Benedict, who in turn is distantly connected to the Olivetans, a small sub-order of Benedictines. Although it is frequently stated that the Order of St Benedict is also known as that of the Olivetans, this is not true: while all Olivetans are Benedictines, few Benedictines are Olivetans.


On 5 April 1993, the future Pope Benedict XVI was installed as the cardinal bishop of Velletri-Segni. Velletri's coat of arms are emblazoned with three olive trees.


Pope Benedict XVI was born on 16 April, the feast day of Saint Benedict Joseph Labre (26 March 1748 - 16 April 1783), also known as the Holy Pilgrim, with whom the Pope now shares both names, Benedict and Joseph. St. Benedict Labre, however, is not associated with olives, Olivetans or Mount Olivet in any way.


Yet another possible interpretation might be that, like his predecessor — who spoke of the Church needing to "breathe with both lungs" again — Pope Benedict XVI has a special desire to reunite with the Eastern Orthodox churches, which have been separated since the Great Schism in 1054. The olive can of course be taken as a symbol of Greece, and hence the Greek Orthodox Church (and — by extension — the Russian Orthodox Church which grew out of it).


Another interpretation was that "De Gloria Olivae" would promote world peace, as symbolized by the olive branch. In a general audience on 27 April 2005, Benedict XVI explained that he chose his regnal name as a link to Benedict XV, "Religio Depopulata", and that: "In his footsteps I place my ministry, in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples, profoundly convinced that the great good of peace is above all a gift of God, a fragile and precious gift to be invoked, safeguarded and constructed, day after day and with everyone's contribution."


Some, who expect Pope Benedict XVI to restore order and discipline, namely, the "rule", Latin "regula", within the Catholic church, the "sheepfold", Latin "ovilis", whence "ovilia", the place where the sheep lay to rest. Consider the phrase to be an imperfect and ungrammatical anagram, "de regola ovilia" (correct Latin: de regula oviliae) or "of the rule of the sheepfold" for the counter-reformation he is expected to introduce.


Others have pointed to the Olivet Discourse in the Gospel of Matthew and argued that the events described therein will come to completion during the reign of this Pope. These people argue that the Tribulation will begin during the reign of Benedict XVI.


[edit] Petrus Romanus
The longest and final motto reads:

In the original Latin:

"In psecutione[75]extrema S.R.E. sedebit Petrus Romanus,
qui pascet oves in multis tribulationibus:
quibus transactis civitas septicollis diruetur,
et Iudex tremendus iudicabit populum suum.
Finis."




This is usually translated into English as:

"During the final persecution of the Holy Roman Church, the seat will be occupied by Peter the Roman,
who will feed his sheep in many tribulations;
and when these things are finished, the seven-hilled city will be destroyed,
and the formidable Judge will judge his people.
The End."



Several anti-popes claiming to be Pope Peter II have emerged in recent years, probably inspired by this motto.
Not everyone who takes the prophecy seriously believes that Petrus Romanus will be the last pope ever, or that he will be called Peter II. Ronald L. Conte Jr., who in 2002 correctly predicted that the pope immediately after John Paul II would be called Benedict XVI but incorrectly predicted that he would be black,[76] believes that Cardinal Francis Arinze will take the name of Pius XIII after the death of Pope Benedict XVI, and that the description "Peter the Roman” means that the "Pope will reaffirm the authority of the Roman Pontiff over the Church; this authority is based on his place as a Successor of Peter" and "will emphasize the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Faith and the Roman Catholic Church above all other religions and denominations, and its authority over all Christians and all peoples of the world," and also will be “the last Pope for about a generation (until the 2040's) to rule from Rome."[77] In Conte’s opinion, St. Malachy’s list ends with Petrus Romanus because his reign will coincide with the beginning of the first part of the Tribulation.
Additionally; with regards to prophecy 112, there is some uncertainty revolving around the word "persecutione" as it has been said that in the very first publication of the prophecies (1595); Arnold de Wion had this word as "psecutione", an abbreviation either for "persecutione" (persecution) or for "prosecutione" (continuation in time), while Messinghan's 1624 had it as "persecutione". If it were indeed "psecutione" (according to de Wion), and this checks out with the original Vatican manuscript he was reporting on, it could be interpreted as "continuation" and the opening line of prophecy 112 could read as - "In the extreme passage of time the seat of the Holy Roman Church will be occupied by Peter the Roman" - thus suggesting that there may be a Pope or Popes in between "De Gloriae olivae" and "Petrus Romanus".
Beside this there's yet another small controversy about Petrus Romanus - according to what we can read in BibleProbe [2], Petrus Romanus was not in St. Malachy’s original list and was first published after the 1820 publication of the prophecies.[78] In other sources we can read that the 112th pope was added in 1559 by the Olivetan monks.[79] And in another we can read that there's actually no 112 number preceding Peter Romanus prophecy [80], meaning that there maybe many popes between Pope Benedict XVI and Peter Romanus or it can also means that Pope Benedict XVI and Peter Romanus are the same.
