Military slang is an array of colloquial terminology used commonly by military personnel, including slang which is unique to or originates with army, naval/marine/coast and air armed forces. It often takes the form of abbreviations/acronyms or derivations of the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, or otherwise incorporates aspects of formal military concepts and terms. Military slang is often used to reinforce or reflect (usually friendly and humorous) interservice rivalries. Military slang has often been incorporated into wider usage. Military slang and jargon are distinguishable, as the latter has official currency, while the former is a grassroots phenomenon.
Some military slang terms have been come to be considered derogatory to varying degrees and audiences, and attempts have been made to curb their use.
