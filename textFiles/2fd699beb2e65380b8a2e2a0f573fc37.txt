Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech was one of the 50 recordings added on the first year of existence of the United States National Recording Registry


The recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry form a registry of recordings selected yearly by the National Recording Preservation Board for preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.[1]
The legislative intent of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 was to develop a national program to guard America's sound recording heritage. The act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts.[2] The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.[3] Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved. The first four yearly lists included 50 selections. However, the 2006 and 2007 lists only included 25 selections each. Thus, a total of 250 recordings have been preserved in the Registry as of 2008. Each year, open nominations are accepted until July 1 for inclusion in that year's list of selections to be announced the following spring. Thus, nominations for the 2008 list to be announced in the spring of 2009 had to be submitted by July 1, 2008 although nominations are accepted year round.[1][4]
Each of the first five yearly lists have included a few recordings that had already been selected for inclusion in the holdings of the National Archives' audiovisual collection. The National Archives maintains holdings of documents and materials created by the United States Federal government that are considered so important for legal or historical reasons that they should be preserved indefinitely.[5] Its audiovisual collection consists of film, sound recordings and videotapes.[6] The National Archives serves American democracy by safeguarding and preserving the records of American Government, ensuring continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and the actions of their government.[7] Thus, those recordings in the National Recording Registry that are of a political nature will tend to overlap with the audiovisual collection of the National Archives. The list shows overlapping items and whether the National Archives has an original or a copy of the recording. The recording on the list that was recorded most recently is Nirvana's album Nevermind and the oldest is Thomas Edison's exhibition recordings.

[edit] Selection criteria
The criteria for selection are as follows:[8]

Recordings selected for the National Recording Registry are those that are culturally, historically or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.
For the purposes of recording selection, "sound recordings" are defined as works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sound component of a moving image work, unless it is available as an autonomous sound recording or is the only extant component of the work.
Recordings may be a single item or group of related items; published or unpublished; and may contain music, non-music, spoken word, or broadcast sound.
Recordings will not be considered for inclusion into the National Recording Registry if no copy of the recording exists.
No recording should be denied inclusion into the National Recording Registry because that recording has already been preserved.
No recording is eligible for inclusion into the National Recording Registry until ten years after the recording's creation.


[edit] 2002
In January 2003, the following 50 selections were made by the National Recording Preservation Board.[9]




Selected exhibitions recording for the phonograph were added in 2002.






Louis Armstrong was one of American music's most important and influential figures. The sessions preserved in the registry, and his solos in particular, set a standard musicians still strive to equal in their beauty and innovation.[9]






The Original Dixieland Jazz Band's "Tiger Rag" launched jazz as a music genre, and is preserved in the registry.






"Downhearted Blues" was the first release by "Empress of the Blues" Bessie Smith.






Booker T. Washington recreated his controversial 1895 Atlanta Exposition Speech in 1906.






Franklin D. Roosevelt's Fireside Chats "redefined the relationship between the president and the American people."[9]






Orson Welles' 1938 "War of the Worlds" radio drama created alarm and panic across the United States.
