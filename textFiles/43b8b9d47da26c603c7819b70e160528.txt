This article is about the logical fallacy.  For other uses, see Straw man (disambiguation).
"Man of straw" redirects here. For the novel Man of Straw by Heinrich Mann, see Der Untertan.
A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position.[1] To "attack a straw man" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting a superficially similar proposition (the "straw man"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position.[1] [2]
Presenting and refuting a weakened form of an opponent's argument can be a part of a valid argument. For example, one can argue that the opposing position implies that at least one of two other statements - both being presumably easier to refute than the original position - must be true. If one refutes both of these weaker propositions, the refutation is valid and does not fit the above definition of a "straw man" argument.

[edit] Origin
A man made of straw, such as those used in military training, is easy to attack. Attacking a straw man can give the illusion of a strong attack or good argument. It is occasionally called a straw dog fallacy, scarecrow argument, "straw person" or wooden dummy argument.[citation needed] In the UK, it is sometimes called Aunt Sally, with reference to a traditional fairground game.

[edit] Reasoning
The straw man fallacy occurs in the following pattern:
1. Person A has position X.
2. Person B ignores X and instead presents position Y.
Y is a distorted version of X and can be set up in several ways, including:

Presenting a misrepresentation of the opponent's position and then refuting it, thus giving the appearance that the opponent's actual position has been refuted.[1]
Quoting an opponent's words out of context — i.e. choosing quotations which are intentionally misrepresentative of the opponent's actual intentions (see contextomy and quote mining).[2]
Presenting someone who defends a position poorly as the defender, then refuting that person's arguments - thus giving the appearance that every upholder of that position (and thus the position itself) has been defeated.[1]
Inventing a fictitious persona with actions or beliefs which are then criticized, implying that the person represents a group of whom the speaker is critical.
Oversimplifying an opponent's argument, then attacking this oversimplified version.

3. Person B attacks position Y, concluding that X is false/incorrect/flawed.
This sort of "reasoning" is fallacious, because attacking a distorted version of a position fails to constitute an attack on the actual position.

[edit] Examples

(Hypothetical) prohibition debate:


Person A: We should liberalize the laws on beer.
Person B: No - any society with unrestricted access to intoxicants loses its work ethic and goes only for immediate gratification.

(The proposal was to relax laws on beer. Person B has exaggerated this to a position harder to defend, i.e. "unrestricted access to intoxicants").[1]

Political debate:


Person A: The war in Iraq is wrong!
Person B: You cannot convince me that liberty is a bad thing.

(B has equated A's opposition to the war as an opposition to liberty which is easier do defeat).

A beach debate:


Person A: Nude bathing is healthy and nude beaches should be permitted here.
Person B: No, that kind of free sex threatens the morality of society.

(B has misrepresented A's position as a call for sexual promiscuity).

Creation-evolution debate:


Person A: The theory of evolution must be taught in science class.
Person B: No, because the universe works too well to be here by pure random chance.

(B has misrepresented A's position and the theory of evolution as a cosmogony).

Person A: Life got here by creation.
Person B: No, the earth could not possibly have been created in six 24-hour days.

(B is representing A as a young-earth creationist, which is not the only creation theory).

[edit] Debating around a straw man
Strictly speaking, there are three ways to deal with a straw man setup. 1. Using the terms of the straw man and refuting the theory itself: Beach debate: "There is no threat to morality with "free" sex. Sex for purposes other than procreation is something that shouldn't be tied to morality, shame, or guilt". (Note: A weakness of this retort is that agreeing to use the terminology of the opponent may deflect the debate to a secondary one about the opponent's assumptions). 2. Clarifying the original theory: "I said evolution should be taught, not that I believe in the big bang". This may involve explicitly pointing out the straw man. 3. Questioning the disputation ("Why could it not have been made in six 24-hour days?"). See also Debate
