This is a list of people who in childhood (at or before 13) showed exceptional abilities in a specific field comparable to those of a highly skilled adult; hence the term child prodigy.

[edit] Mathematics and science

[edit] Mathematics

Srinivasa Ramanujan(22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician, who, with almost no formal training in pure mathematics, made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series and continued fractions.
March Tian Boedihardjo: an Indonesian-Chinese born in 1998. In 2007, he gained entry into Hong Kong Baptist University to study mathematics at the age of 9, becoming the youngest ever university student in Hong Kong.

Sufiah Yusof : a Malaysian, in 1997, she gained entry into St. Hilda's College, Oxford University to study mathematics at the age of 12. [1]
Terence Tao
Magnus LaDue At 9 years old, he discovered an error in one of the Laplace transforms in the CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae. The incorrect result appears in formula 36 on p. 607.
Sir William Rowan Hamilton The great mathematician read Hebrew at the age of seven, and studied Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Syriac, Sanskrit and four others continental languages when he was twelve.[2]
Blaise Pascal (June 19, 1623 – August 19, 1662): A French mathematician, physicist, and religious philosopher who wrote a treatise on vibrating bodies at age 9, his first proof on a wall with a piece of coal at age 11 and a theorem by age 16. Famous for Pascal's theorem and many other contributions in mathematics, philosophy, and physics.


[edit] Mental calculators
Note: Several mathematicians were mental calculators when they were still children. This section is for child prodigies largely or primarily known for calculating skills. It should be noted that mental calculators are sometimes more like savants than they are like child prodigies. They have skills that rarely exist in adults and they may not be truly "mature" in mathematical understanding.

Shakuntala Devi: Her abilities were first recognized at age 3.[3]
John Von Neumann: A "mental calculator" by age 6 who could tell jokes in classical Greek.[4][5]

[edit] The Arts

[edit] Acting/directing
Note: This section is mostly limited to child actors or directors who were respected enough to be nominated or win awards against adult competitors or who were declared prodigies. It also includes a few actors from eras predating film who were declared theatrical prodigies. This section must be limited in this way because being even an award-winning child actor is not, in itself, prodigious. (For child actors who won against juvenile competition see Academy Juvenile Award. These names do not necessarily equate to being competitive with adults and therefore do not necessarily fit as prodigies.)
