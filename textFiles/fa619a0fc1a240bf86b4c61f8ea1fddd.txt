"txt" redirects here. For other uses, see TXT.
SMS language or Textese (also known as chatspeak, txt, txtspk, txtk, texting language or txt talk) is the English language slang used in mobile phone SMS, social networks and instant messaging. It is an abbreviated form of English similar to a rebus. With predictive text input increasingly being used, it is becoming less common.[citation needed] This type of language does not always obey or follow standard English grammar; furthermore, the words used in the writing system may not be found in standard dictionaries.

[edit] Significance
The objective of textese is to use the fewest number of characters needed to convey a comprehensible message. Hence, punctuation, grammar, and capitalization are largely ignored.
The dialect has a few hieroglyphs (codes comprehensible to initiates) and a range of face symbols.[1] According to a study, though it is faster to write it takes more time to read than normal English.[2] According to research done by Dr.Nanagh Kemp of University of Tasmania, the evolution of ‘textese’ is inherently coupled to a strong grasp of grammar and phonetics.[3]

[edit] History




Look up txt in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

Textese is a nascent dialect of English that subverts letters and numbers to produce ultra-concise words and sentiments.[4] The invention of mobile phone messages may be considered as its source, although elliptical styles of writing dating back to at least the days of telegraphese. There are no standard rules for writing SMS languages, and a lot of words can also be shortened, such as "text" then turns into "txt". Words can also be combined with numbers to make them shorter, such as "later" turns into "l8r". Its speed in which they can be written and helps in using fewest number of letters, and helps in dealing with space constraints of text messaging.
It is similar to AOL speak and Telex speak, and has evolved from the shorthand use in Internet chatrooms to accommodate the small number of characters allowed (early SMS permitted only 160 characters and some carriers charge messages by the number of characters sent), and as a convenient language for the small keyboards on mobile phones.

[edit] Vocabulary

[edit] Single letters can replace words

be becomes b
see becomes c
are becomes r
you becomes u
why becomes y


[edit] Single digits can replace words

ate becomes 8
for becomes 4
to or too becomes 2
one or won becomes 1


[edit] A single letter or digit can replace a syllable

ate becomes 8, so:

great becomes gr8
mate becomes m8
later becomes l8r or l8a
skate becomes sk8
skater becomes sk8r


tomorrow becomes 2mro
for or fore becomes 4, so:

before becomes (combining both of the above) b4
therefore becomes thr4




[edit] Combinations of the above can shorten a single or multiple words

Your and You're both become ur or yr

[edit] Frequency of use



This section requires expansion.


In one American study, researchers found that less than 20% of messages used SMS language.[5]
In a collection gathered by linguist David Crystal, just 10% of messages used SMS language [5]

[edit] The use of txt in school exams
There have been some reports in the media of children using SMS language for essays in school:

(16 August 2002). “Examiner's warning over exams culture”. BBC.
(4 March 2003). “Is txt mightier than the word?”. BBC.
November 2006. The New Zealand Qualifications Authority discourages the use of text abbreviations after suggesting that they may be used in certain subjects provided they clearly show the required understanding. NZQA Press statement [1]
