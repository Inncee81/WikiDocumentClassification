List of Bilderberg participants from 1978


List of Bilderberg attendees is a list of prominent persons who have attended one or more conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group. The list is currently organized by category. It is not a complete list and it includes both living and deceased people. Where known, the year(s) they attended are denoted in brackets.
The Bilderberg conference is an unofficial annual invitation-only conference of around 130 guests, most of whom are persons of influence in the fields of business, media, and politics.
The elite group meets annually at luxury hotels or resorts throughout the world, normally in Europe, once every four years in the United States or Canada. It has an office in Leiden, South Holland, Netherlands.[1] They met at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Istanbul, Turkey for the June 2007 meeting.[2] The 56th Bilderberg meeting took place June 6-8, 2008 at the Westfields Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia.
