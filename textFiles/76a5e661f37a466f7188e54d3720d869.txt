Arduinome


An Arduinome is a controller device that mimics the Monome using the Arduino physical computing platform.

[edit] Concept
The Monome was conceived of as open source hardware. Its schematics and firmware were made public.
The creation of the Arduinome was possible because of the publication of the Monome schematics and code. In acknowledgment of this, and at the request of the creators of Monome, Arduinomes should not be built for profit or otherwise undercut the sales of original Monomes.

[edit] Parts
As well as the Arduino board, many Arduinome's make use of SparkFun silicone button pads and printed circuit boards (PCB).
