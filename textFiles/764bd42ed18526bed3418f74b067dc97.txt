Gamebryo is a game engine, originally from Numerical Design Limited (NDL), and is the successor to NDL's NetImmerse engine.
Since the creation of Gamebryo, NDL merged with Emergent Game Technologies. The new company is known as "Emergent Game Technologies" (EGT). Gamebryo, now called Gamebryo Element, is the product of the new Emergent Game Technologies.

[edit] Description
Gamebryo Element is a 3D computer graphics engine, written in the C++ programming language and targeted at game development. It supports the following platforms:[1]

Windows

DirectX 9 (Latest Version, currently 2.6)
DirectX 10 (Latest Version, from 2.6 onwards)


Nintendo GameCube (Up to Version 1.2)
Wii / WiiWare (Latest Version, currently 2.6)
PlayStation 2 (Up to Version 1.2)
PlayStation 3 / PSN (Latest Version, currently 2.6)
Xbox (Up to Version 1.2)
Xbox 360 (Latest Version, currently 2.6) (including Xbox Live Arcade[2])

A Gamebryo license can be purchased as either binary (headers, libraries and tools) or with full source code, so developers can debug the engine (and use it as reference for any customizations). Additionally, Gamebryo comes with searchable documentation. Some developers complain that much of the documentation for the Maya plugins is incomplete.[citation needed] Gamebryo is genre agnostic and is used in virtually every 3D domain from all types of AAA games, casual titles and serious games/simulation technologies. Educational licenses are also made available by Emergent for universities and schools running 3D technology courses.

[edit] Industry use
Gamebryo is used throughout the video game industry. Some of the developers who use EGT's Gamebryo include:

Bethesda Softworks (Morrowind, Oblivion and Fallout 3)
Firaxis (for Pirates!, Civilization IV and Railroads!)
Irrational Games (Freedom Force)
Mad Doc Software (Empire Earth II and Empire Earth III)
Mythic Entertainment (Dark Age of Camelot and Warhammer Online)
Timegate Studios (Kohan II, Axis & Allies)
MindArk (Entropia Universe)
Blue Fang Games (Zoo Tycoon 2)
Google (Lively)
Square Enix (untitled project in development)[3]
