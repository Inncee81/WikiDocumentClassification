Lazarus is a cross platform visual IDE which provides a Delphi clone for Pascal and Object Pascal developers. It is developed for and supported by the Free Pascal compiler, and as of March 2008 available for several Linux distributions, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.
Distributed under a mix of free software licenses[1], Lazarus is free software, just as Free Pascal is. Notably among those licences is a modified version of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The modification grants extra permissions to allow Lazarus to be used in proprietary software.[2]
Free Pascal is a compiler which runs on many operating systems. It is designed to use and compile Delphi source code, which is Object Oriented Pascal. Unlike Java which is intended to be write once, run anywhere, Lazarus and Free Pascal aim to be write once, compile anywhere. As the same compiler is available for all of the above operating systems, there is no need for recoding to produce identical products for different platforms, except when operating-system-dependent features are used. Cross-compiling is supported.
Under Microsoft Windows Lazarus is less stable and less well-documented than Delphi, but has multi-platform capability and is more transparent, customizable and can run from a USB flash drive. Under Linux, Delphi source code can be compiled with Lazarus with a little adaptation. Lazarus source code can be adapted to compile under Delphi and Kylix (An abandoned version of Delphi for Linux).

[edit] Lazarus and UI access

[edit] LCL
The Lazarus GUI subsystem, Lazarus Component Library (LCL), is a set of visual and non visual component classes over a Widget toolkit-dependent part. The LCL is based on the Delphi6 VCL, but has not been kept totally compatible to improve use with operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.

[edit] Interfaces - Widget toolkit dependence
In Lazarus terminology, this part is called simply "the Interface". Actually it's more like one Interface per Widget toolkit.
The current status of Widget toolkit Interface is roughly like this:

Win32 GDI support (win32 native) is in mainstream use.
GTK+ 1.2.x is in mainstream use (Unix derivatives including Mac OS X)
GTK+ 2.6+ is fully working and in mainstream use.
Qt 4.2+ has headers translated, and the interface is fully implemented.
for Cocoa (Mac OS X native toolkit, Objective C) there are bindings and a initial interface.
for Carbon (Mac OS X native toolkit, C) is in mainstream use.
wince (Windows CE native) is almost fully working.
fpGUI (Free Pascal GUI toolkit) has a initial interface.


[edit] PDA support
Currently there is no cross platform tool for PDAs or good RADs. Support for PDAs on Lazarus is being implemented and it may occupy this vacancy.
Platforms with LCL Interfaces being implemented:

Windows CE
Qtopia

Possible in the future:

PalmOS
Symbian OS


[edit] Development process
The Lazarus project has a good community and a vigorous development process, with many contributors and development testers. The community solves the problems using a discussion board, and programmers submit fixes for issues raised on the board. Each night untested builds are generated for beta testing.

[edit] Database support
Developers can install packages which allow Lazarus to support several databases. Programs can interact with databases through code or by components dropped on a form. The data-aware components represent fields and are connected by the correct setting of properties to a TDataSource, which represents a table, and to the database components, which may be TPSQLDatabase, TSQLiteDataSet, or equivalent.
The following databases are directly supported:

PostgreSQL, with the PSQL package
dBase and FoxPro can be supported without the need for an external server or library through the TDbf component
MySQL works
SQLite needs a single external library and the TSqliteDataset component
MSSQL is working with Zeoslib
InterBase / Firebird also work with the latest ZeosLib

Some helper data providers (CSV, SDF) are also provided.

[edit] Cross-development
Free Pascal supports cross-compiling, and Lazarus applications can be cross-compiled from Windows to Linux and FreeBSD and vice versa. Compiling from Mac OS X to Windows, Linux and FreeBSD is possible. Cross-compiling to OS X has been done, but is not ready for use by end users.
Lazarus is also used to build PDA applications, e.g. for Windows CE, on a machine running Linux or Windows.

[edit] Limitations
While resembling the Delphi RAD in many ways, there are a few limitations regarding the performance and feature set:

Under Windows executable file size is somewhat larger than the Delphi equivalent because debug information is included within Lazarus executables, instead of as separate files like Delphi. Lazarus program file size can be significantly reduced by using Strip. See also FPC wiki: Size Matters
Components for Delphi can be installed in Lazarus, but they must be converted, which can be complex.
Missing important media libraries and widgets:

Microsoft Office connectivity
Datasnap (not a publicly documented system, Borland proprietary enterprise functionality)


Networking is mostly available, with a wealth of packages to choose from:

Indy.

Status: Linux/x86, win32: 100 percent working;
FreeBSD/x86: also 100 percent, but requires developer's versions;
Mac OS X/PowerPC: servers untested, various endianness problems in demos;
Other platforms remain untested, though some client success on wince was claimed;


ICS A bit win32-centric, but quite well suited for Windows-specific customization if needed.
Synapse FPC support hugely improved the last year.
lNet is an FPC native non-blocking variant, with Linux/FreeBSD specific (KSE/EPoll) optimizations for mass connectivity


No support to directly call .NET libraries. On the other hand, it is possible to call Object Pascal code from .NET software. [1]
The COM support was missing from the 2.0.x series, but was initially working in 2.2.0, and has matured fast since.
No frames (*)
No visual form inheritance (*)
Missing dynamically loadable packages support.
Not 100 percent compatible with VCL. As mentioned previously this is by design, although the current LCL widget set should suffice for most applications. But this makes the deep repository of available VCL widgets inaccessible without conversion. The conversion effort mostly involves some editing, although there are a few fundamental differences. When porting, missing units in the libraries and COM support are a considerably bigger problem than incompatibilities between LCL and VCL.

(*) denotes features currently being worked on

[edit] Licensing
Although Lazarus software is GPL licensed, software developed using it can be deployed on any license. The Lazarus Component Library (LCL) is statically linked into programs and is licensed using a modified version of LGPL specially designed to allow static linking to proprietary programs. (the "special" linking is an own wording of GNU's GPL-With-Linking-Exception. Meanwhile the wording has changed to more closely match the GNU variant. It doesn't matter if the linking exception is applied to the GPL (as GNU does) or LGPL (as FPC/Lazarus did), since the exception is more liberal than the differences between both )
Note that installing a designtime package is equivalent to linking to the IDE. So distributing the Lazarus IDE with non-GPL compatible (e.g. MPL, the Jedi packages) designtime packages pre-installed would be a license violation. Despite that, you can build proprietary Lazarus packages, as long as you don't distribute a Lazarus pre-installed with them.

[edit] Applications produced with Lazarus

Audio X is a media management tool that can organize and sort your media without using a separate database, so the data set is always synchronized. Many audio formats are usable directly but you can also organize your LP or CD collection with it. It stores data in XML files so they are also viewable with a web browser. Made with Lazarus/FPC.
Cactus Jukebox is an audio player that comes with a database to organize your MP3 file collection. It is platform independent and currently available for Linux and 32-bit Windows. Made with Lazarus/FPC.
Becape is a open source backup tool aimed at personal/desktop usage. It does incremental backups and stores the backup info in an SQLite database allowing the restoration of the exact state of the backed files at a chosen date. It's fully written in Lazarus/Freepascal.
CQRLOG is an advanced ham radio logger based on a Firebird database. Provides radio control based on hamlib libraries (currently support of 140+ radio types and models), DX cluster connection, QRZ callbook (web version), a grayliner, ON6DP QSL manager database support and a most accurate country resolution algorithm based on country tables developed by OK1RR. CQRLOG is strongly focused on easy operation and maintenance. Made with Lazarus/FPC.
Dedalu is a collection of small and simple projects developed in Lazarus/FPC by Giuseppe Ridinò (aka Pepecito). They are games, editors, utilities, etc.
KComm is a ham radio logging program developed specifically for Elecraft K2 and K3 transceivers. It works under Windows or Linux. It is designed for the average ham radio operator who wants an easy to use logging program also suitable for casual contest use. It supports CW Transmit from the keyboard, CW decoding, PSK31/63 transmit and receive. DX Cluster client and integration with CW Skimmer. Made with Lazarus/FPC.
