^ a b c d e  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Cyprus,  Georgia, and  Turkey, classified as Asian countries by the United Nations Statistics Division, are often considered also as European countries, since their territories are either partly in Europe or in the vicinity of Europe (for the geographical boundaries between Asia and Europe, see here), and they have close political and historical ties with Europe (e.g., they are members of the Council of Europe).
^ a b c d  Abkhazia,  Nagorno-Karabakh,  Northern Cyprus, and  South Ossetia, all sovereign states lacking general international recognition, can also be considered as European countries.
^ Russia is generally considered as a European country more than an Asian country, even though most of its territory is in Asia, since most of its population and also its capital are in Europe, and it has close political and historical ties with Europe. Among the federal districts of Russia, four are in Europe (Central, Southern, Northwestern and Volga) and three are in Asia (Far Eastern, Siberian and Urals).
