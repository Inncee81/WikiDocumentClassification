From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Web log analysis software (also called a web log analyzer) is a simple kind of Web analytics software that parses a log file from a web server, and based on the values contained in the log file, derives indicators about who, when, and how a web server is visited. Usually reports are generated from the log files immediately, but the log files can alternatively be parsed to a database and reports generated on demand.

[edit] Indicators reported by most web log analyzers

Number of visits and number of unique visitors
Visits duration and last visits
Authenticated users, and last authenticated visits
Days of week and rush hours
Domains/countries of host's visitors
Hosts list
Number total pageviews
Most viewed, entry and exit pages
Files type
OS used
Browsers used
Robots
HTTP referrer
Search engines, key phrases and keywords used to find the analyzed web site
HTTP errors
Some of the log analyzers also report on who's on the site, conversion tracking and page navigation.
