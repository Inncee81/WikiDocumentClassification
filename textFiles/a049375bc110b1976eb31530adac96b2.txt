[edit] Medieval

[edit] England
Following the collapse of the Roman Empire there followed a period where the Romano-British political entity fragmented caused mainly by the Celtic system of dividing a realm between the sons of a king on his death. This situation was made worse after c.449 when Jutes and later Anglo-Saxons began colonising the eastern and southern seaboards and driving inland. Eventually the Romano-Britons (now known to the Anglo-Saxons as "Welsh") were assimilated or driven into the highlands of Cambria (Wales) or Caledonia (Scotland). Wales and Scotland will be considered separate from what once existed in England.

[edit] Ireland
Extinct kingdoms in Ireland Ireland during the early medieval period consisted of some two hundred tuathas or minor kingdoms, which were in turn vassals of the rulers of an over-kingdom, called a cóiced (usually translated as a portion, a fifth, or a province). The most prominent of these kingdoms were

Aileach - later Tír Conaill and Tír Eógain
Airgíalla
Ulaid
Mide
Laighin
Osraighe
Munster - including Ormond, Desmond and Thomond
Uí Maine
Connacht

Between the 8th and 12th centuries, various Ard Rí attempted unsuccessfully to impose their rule over all the kingdoms in Ireland. Among those whose efforts almost made this a reality were Flann Sinna, reigned 877-916); Niall Glúndub mac Áedo (916-919); Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig (1002-1014); Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain (1055-1086; and Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair (1119-1156). The last of these kingdoms ceased to exist in the early 17th century. Further Irish kingdoms included:

Aidhne
Breifne
Dál Fiatach
Dál nAraidi
Dál Riata (this kingdom spanned western Scotland and northeastern Ireland)
Desmond
Dublin
Fir Manach
Meath
Moylurg

Those indigenous states which were still in existence by the time of the first permanent European colonizations from the late fifteenth century onwards were soon substantively destroyed and/or absorbed.

Notes


Indigenous peoples of the Americas
The whole of North America
Native Americans in the United States and the First Nations of Canada had established varying levels of governmental organization before contact with Europeans; in many cases, these were equivalent to contemporary European levels of government organization.
All the native peoples were eventually incorporated into the United States and Canada, but many retain various levels of self-government and autonomy within those two nations.



Cahokia
Illinois, Missouri
The population of the town at Cahokia exploded circa 1050 AD, indicating the establishment of a large "chiefdom"
The population of Cahokia dispersed in the 14th Century, indicating the decline of the Cahokia chiefdom
Other political bodies existed in the Mississippian culture; the Mississippian culture article has a list of Known Mississippian Chiefdoms


Huron Confederacy
Central Ontario
Confederacy of five Iroquoian tribes and several smaller groups. Controlled trade in corn and furs in the upper Great Lakes area and sporadically through the Ottawa and St. Lawrence River valleys.
The Hurons were dispersed by the Iroquois in 1649. Many fled to the northern Lake Michigan region and Quebec, while a large group joined the Iroquois.



Iroquois Confederacy
Upstate New York and surrounding areas.
Formed before European contact; arguably as early as 31 August 1142, though also likely sometime in the 15th to the 17th Century
The Treaty of Canandaigua, signed in 1794, established relations between the United States government and the Iroquois; the treaty is still in force, though the Confederacy is no longer effectively an independent nation.



Cherokee Nation
Originally in the southeastern United States, primarily Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Part of the nation (and its government structures) ended up in present-day Oklahoma.
The Cherokee nation was unified from an interrelated society of city-states in the early 18th century under the "Emperor" Moytoy
The Cherokee Nation and several smaller nations which broke off are still federally recognized tribal entities, somewhat autonomous within the United States, but having similar powers to states.



Vermont Republic
