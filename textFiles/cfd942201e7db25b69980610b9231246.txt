From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
This is a list of the best-selling albums in the United States based on RIAA certification. The criteria are that the album must have been published (including self-publishing by the artist), and the album must have shipped at least 10 million units in the United States. Groupings are based on different certification benchmarks, the highest being for certification of at least 20–29 times platinum, and the lowest being for certification of 10–14 times platinum. Albums are listed in order of certification (highest to lowest), and order of release date (earliest to most recent). This list contains any type of album, including studio, greatest hits, compilation, various artists, soundtrack and remix.
Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) by the Eagles is the album with the highest certification awarded in the United States, being certified 29× platinum which is a total of 29 million copies shipped to retail stores.
Please note that as a result of the RIAA's methodology of counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification, most double albums on the list, such as The Wall, Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II, Garth Brooks' Double Live, The White Album, Physical Graffiti, and Speakerboxxx/The Love Below have been certified for twice as many units than actual albums sold. Conversely, the certification level for double albums that fit onto one compact disc such as the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack reflect the actual number of albums sold. Other notable double LPs that would appear on this list if counted as two units are the Grease soundtrack (8x platinum), Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (7x platinum) and Peter Frampton's Frampton Comes Alive! (6x platinum).
