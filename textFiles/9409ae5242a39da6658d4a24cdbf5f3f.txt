LCARS screens, as seen in Star Trek Nemesis


In the Star Trek fictional universe, LCARS (an acronym for Library Computer Access/Retrieval System, pronounced /ɛl karz/), is a fictional computer operating system depicted in the Star Trek television series and motion pictures. Within Star Trek chronology, the term was first used in Star Trek: The Next Generation and in subsequent shows. In a real-world context, the term "LCARS" is frequently used to describe the style of the computer displays of the LCARS system, especially the screens from The Next Generation. The term Okudagram, named for Michael Okuda, the designer of the graphics, is also used to refer to this style. The design is popular among Star Trek fansites.

[edit] Production
The LCARS GUI was designed by scenic art supervisor and technical consultant Michael Okuda. The original design concept was influenced by a request from Gene Roddenberry that the instrument panels not have a great deal of activity on them. This minimalized look was designed to give a sense that the technology was much more advanced than in the original Star Trek. The early display panels were made out of colored Plexiglas with light behind them. This can produce complex-looking displays cheaply. As the show progressed there was more use of animations. Most of the animations seen on the show are displayed on video equipment built into the sets.[citation needed]
