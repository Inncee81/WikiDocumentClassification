[edit] Development
The main developer of LiVES is Salsaman (Gabriel Finch), who is also a video artist and international VJ.
The project began in late 2002, and it is expected that the 1.0 version will be released sometime early in 2009.
On the Freshmeat site, LiVES is listed as the 4th most popular non-linear video editing software [1] despite being still a beta release.
The LiVES application allows the user to manipulate video in realtime and in non-realtime. The application also has features which go beyond traditional video editing applications - for example, it can be controlled and monitored remotely over a network, and it has facilities for streaming to and from another copy of LiVES.
LiVES uses a system of plugins for effects, decoders, encoders and video playback. The API's for these are now well defined, and the application can be easily extended.
