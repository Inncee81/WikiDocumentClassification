From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

OpenCourseWare, or OCW, is a term applied to course materials created by universities and shared freely with the world via the internet. The OCW movement began at MIT with the launch of MIT OpenCourseWare in October 2002. Since then, a number of universities have created OCW projects, some of which have been funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
According to the website of the OCW Consortium, an OCW project:

is a free and open digital publication of high quality educational materials, organized as courses.
is available for use and adaptation under an open license.
does not typically provide certification or access to instructors.[1]

[edit] Technology

Utah State University's Center for Open Sustainable Learning developed a Content Management System for OCW known as eduCommons, a technology which is utilized by many members of the OCW Consortium. eduCommons is built on the open source Content Management System called Plone.[citation needed]
