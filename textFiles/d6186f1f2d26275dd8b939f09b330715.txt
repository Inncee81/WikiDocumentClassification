This is an incomplete list, which may never be able to satisfy certain standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with sourced additions.


This is a list of the highest prices paid for paintings. Very valuable paintings, if sold, are usually sold at auctions.
The world's most famous paintings, especially works done before 1800, are generally owned by museums, which very rarely sell them, and as such, they are quite literally priceless. Guinness World Records lists the Mona Lisa as having the highest insurance value for a painting in history. It was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962, before the painting toured the United States for several months. However, the Louvre chose to spend the money that would have been spent on the insurance premium on security instead. Taking inflation into account, the 1962 value would be approximately US$670 million in 2006.

[edit] List of highest prices paid at auctions or private sales (inflation adjusted)
This list is ordered by consumer price index inflation-adjusted value (in bold) in millions of 2008 United States dollars. Where necessary, the price is first converted to dollars using the exchange rate at the time the painting was sold. The inflation adjustment may change as recent inflation rates are often revised. A list in another currency would probably be in a slightly different order due to exchange rate fluctuations. Paintings are only listed once, i.e. for the highest price sold.

[edit] Notes

^ Reportedly, Gachet's portrait was privately resold to a European buyer in 1997 or 1998 for $65-$90 million through Sotheby’s [1] [2]
^ Privately resold for ca. $50 million through Sotheby’s in 1997 [3]
^ Alan Bond could not pay off the painting, and Irises was resold (probably for somewhat less) to the Getty Museum.
^ Kimmelman, Michael: How the MoMA got the Van Gogh, New York Times, 09 October 1989.
^ Later in 2002, Thomson donated his private collection, including the Rubens, to the Art Gallery of Ontario [4]
^ Most expensive painting by a living artist
^ Annenberg donated it subsequently to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
^ Steve Wynn, who bid on the painting at auction, privately acquired the work several months later from the unidentified buyer for an undisclosed, supposedly lower price. Kenneth Griffin acquired it in 2004 from Wynn [5]. Some news articles, probably by mistake, claim that Griffin was the buyer at Sotheby's in 1999 [6].
^ Thornton, Sarah; Adam, Georgina (May 4, 2008), "Revealed: $72.8m Rockefeller Rothko has gone to Qatar", The Art Newspaper, http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=7946 
^ resold for £12m to Stavros Niarchos in 1993
^ In October 2006, Steve Wynn purportedly agreed to sell Le Rêve to Steven Cohen for $139 million, but Wynn accidentally elbowed a hole in the middle of the canvas, thus scuppering the sale. The sale would have made Le Rêve the most expensive painting at the time.
^ On Oct. 7, 2005, The New York Times reported that Steven Cohen bought van Gogh's "Peasant Woman Against a Background of Wheat" and Gauguin's "Bathers" (1903) from Steve Wynn for approximately $110 million [7], though guesses range from $100-150 million. One or both of the paintings may thus occur higher on this list.
