From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Textile is a lightweight markup language originally developed by Dean Allen and billed as a "humane Web text generator". Textile converts its marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML and also inserts character entity references for apostrophes, opening and closing single and double quotation marks, ellipses and em dashes.
Textile was originally implemented in PHP, but has been translated into other programming languages including Perl, Python, Ruby, ASP, Java and C#.
Textile is distributed under a BSD-style license and is included with, or available as a plugin for, several content-management systems.
Version 2.0 beta was released in 2004 as part of the Textpattern content management system.
Version 2.0 was released in 2006.
