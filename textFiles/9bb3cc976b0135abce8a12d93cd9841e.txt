John Hamon french Artist in Paris.


Street art is any art developed in public spaces — that is, "in the streets" — though the term usually refers to art of an illicit nature, as opposed to government sponsored initiatives. The term can include traditional graffiti artwork, stencil graffiti, sticker art, wheatpasting and street poster art, video projection, art intervention, guerrilla art, flash mobbing and street installations. Typically, the term Street Art or the more specific Post-Graffiti is used to distinguish contemporary public-space artwork from territorial graffiti, vandalism, and corporate art.




Owl, Mezer, Moss. Venice Beach, Ca.


The motivations and objectives that drive street artists are as varied as the artists themselves. There is a strong current of activism and subversion in urban art. Street art can be a powerful platform for reaching the public, and frequent themes include adbusting, subvertising and other culture jamming, the abolishment of private property and reclaiming the streets. Other street artists simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places. However the universal theme in most, if not all street art, is that adapting visual artwork into a format which utilizes public space, allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised, to reach a much broader audience than traditional artwork and galleries normally allow.

[edit] Techniques
Whereas traditional graffiti artists have primarily used free-hand aerosol paints to produce their works,[1] "street art" encompasses many other media and techniques, including;

Wheatpasting
Sticker art
Stencil art
Mosaic tiling
Video projection/LED art
Woodblocking
Street installations
Murals

Traditional graffiti also has increasingly been adopted as a method for advertising; its trajectory has even in some cases led to its artists' working on contract as graphic artists for corporations.[2] Street art is a label often adopted by artists who wish to keep their work unaffiliated, and strongly political. Street artists are those whose work is still largely done without official approval in public areas.
For these reasons street art is sometimes considered "post-graffiti" and sometimes even "neo-graffiti".[3] Street art can be found around the world and street artists often travel to other countries foreign to them so they can spread their designs.

[edit] Street artists
The first Street art artist was Gérfrom Zlotykamien from France[citation needed]. He was born in 1940 in Paris. Street artists such as Banksy, D*Face, Swoon, Twist, 108, Ellis Gallagher, Neck face, Os Gemeos and have earned international attention for their work and in turn migrated the showing of their works to the museum or gallery setting as well as the street. It is also not uncommon for street artists to achieve commercial success Shepard Fairey, Faile, WK Interact[4], Kaws, Ash and Buff Monster doing graphics for other companies or starting their own merchandising lines.

[edit] Key locations
See also: Street Art in Melbourne
While practically every large city in the world and some of the larger regional towns, host some form of street art or graffiti, there are a few locations that are considered to harbour forerunners of particular mediums or foster a pioneering street art culture in general. Such locations often attract internationally known street artists who travel to these locations to exhibit their works. The following is an incomplete list of a few of the most notable locations;

Berlin, Germany - has attracted attention to international street artists since the reunification of the city making it one of Europe's street art strongholds. A lot of bizarre post-communist locations, cheap rents and ramshackle buildings gave rise to a vibrant street art scene. Hotspots include; Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain.


Bristol, U.K. - also is part of a vibrant street art scene due in part to the success of Banksy.


Melbourne, Australia - see Street Art in Melbourne - home to one of the world's most active and diverse street art cultures, and a pioneer in the stencil medium. Street artists such as Banksy have often exhibited works on Melbourne's streets. Key locations within the city include; Brunswick, Carlton, Fitzroy, Northcote and the city centre including Hosier Lane.


Sao Paulo, Brazil - generally viewed as one of the capitals of street art, and particularly murals. The lively and colourful atmosphere of the city is reflected in the street art scene, quickly evolving into one of the biggest and best in the world, drawing in many artists from around the world to collaborate.


New York City,USA - considered the home of graffiti, New York City has a thriving street art scene.
