MusE is a MIDI/Audio sequencer with recording and editing capabilities written by Werner Schweer. MusE aims to be a complete multitrack virtual studio for Linux: it currently has no support under other platforms as it relies on Linux-only technologies, including JACK and ALSA.
From version 0.7 it has no music notation abilities as these were moved to MuseScore. [1]
Published under the GNU General Public License, MusE is free software.
