[edit] Comparison
An attempt to classify data structures based on feature attributes:


Structure
Stable
Unique
Cells per Node


Bag (multiset)
no
no
1


Set
no
yes
1


List
yes
no
1


Map
no
yes
2


"Stable" means that input order is retained. Other structures such as "linked list" and "stack" cannot easily be defined this way because there are specific operations associated with them.
