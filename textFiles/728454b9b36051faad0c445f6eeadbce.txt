From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
This is a list of Free software / open source software packages: computer software licensed under an open source license / Free software license. Software that fits the Free software definition may be more appropriately called free software; the GNU project in particular objects to their works being referred to as open source. For more information about the philosophical background for open source software, see free software movement and Open Source Initiative. However, nearly all software meeting the Open Source Definition also meets The Free Software Definition and vice versa. Software that meets either is listed here.
