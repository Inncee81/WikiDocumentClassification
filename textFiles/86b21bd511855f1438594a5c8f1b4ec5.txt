Neo-Luddism is a modern movement of opposition to specific or general technological development.
The term "Neo-Luddite" is derived from Luddite, a political/historical term relating to a political movement by that name, that took place in England during the Industrial Revolution
The term "neo-Luddite" is often deployed by advocates of technology to describe persons or organizations that resist technological advances.

Neo-Luddites come from a variety of political backgrounds, ranging from anarchists (such as anarcho-primitivists) to political conservatives (such as eco-fascists).
Neo-Luddites claim that there are a wide range of problems with the development of technology including:

Increases in government/ corporate control over individual lives, which might lead to a totalitarian state
loss of personal privacy due to development of surveillance technologies
dehumanization
alienation[1], depression, and other mental disorders[2]
environmental degradation[3]
increased division of labor[4][3]
Health problems caused by industrialization, such as cancers, heart disease, and birth defects
social decay
the possibility of nuclear war
cruelty to animals
the destruction of tribal[5] and nature-based[6] ways of life

Some neo-Luddites, such as those in the anarcho-primitivist or green anarchist movements advance explicitly anti-technology arguments, viewing technology as a fundamental form of oppression, destruction, and alienation. Notable thinkers and writers in this vein include John Zerzan, Derrick Jensen, Jacques Ellul, Kirkpatrick Sale, and Chellis Glendinning.
The actions and words of Theodore Kaczynski[7] and groups like the Earth Liberation Front may also be seen as a militant articulation of Luddism.
The historical Luddite movement of the early 19th century is often referenced positively by people who consider themselves Luddites.
