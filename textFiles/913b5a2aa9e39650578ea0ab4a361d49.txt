A State of Trance


A State Of Trance (often abbreviated as ASOT) is the title of a weekly radio show hosted by popular trance DJ Armin van Buuren. First airing in March 2001 on ID&T Radio (the predecessor of Slam!FM), the show takes the format of a two hour mix in which he plays new trance music, both promotional and commercially released. Selected tracks are announced during the show in order to help promote new artists and releases. Its radio-show/website combination has proven popular internationally, as fans — while listening to the radio-show — will converse in the website chat-rooms and forums, such as DI.FM, during the broadcast. Internationally, the show attracts more than 30 million listeners each week[1],making it the most popular radio programme in the world.
