Michael Porter.


Michael Eugene Porter (born 1947) is a University Professor at Harvard Business School, with academic interests in management and economics. He is the founder of a nonprofit organization called the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City and one of the founders of The Monitor Group. Porter's main academic objectives focus on how a firm or a region can build a competitive advantage and develop competitive strategy. He is also a Fellow Member of the Strategic Management Society. Porter graduated from Princeton University in 1969, where he was an outstanding intercollegiate golfer. He has two daughters and is divorced. One of his most significant contributions is the five forces.
Porter's strategic system consists primarily of:

Porter's Five Forces Analysis
strategic groups (also called strategic sets)
the value chain
the generic strategies of cost leadership, product differentiation, and focus
the market positioning strategies of variety based, needs based, and access based market positions
global strategy
Porter's clusters of competence for regional economic development
Diamond model

[edit] Criticisms
Porter has been criticized by some academics for inconsistent logical argument in his assertions.[1] Critics have also labeled Porter's conclusions as lacking in empirical support and as justified with selective case studies.[2] [3] [4] [5]
