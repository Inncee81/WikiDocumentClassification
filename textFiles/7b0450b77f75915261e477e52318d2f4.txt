The Beatles released twelve original albums, twelve EPs, one double EP, and twenty-four singles (mainly featuring original music not found on their albums) in eight years (1962-1970) in their native United Kingdom. Their international discography is complicated, however, due to sometimes different versions of their albums released in other countries, particularly in their early years on Capitol Records in the United States. In addition, most of their releases are available in both mono and stereo mixes.
The Beatles discography was originally released on the vinyl format, with full-length long plays (LPs), shorter extended plays (EPs), and singles. Over the years, the collection has also been released on cassette, 8-track, and compact disc (CD). The Beatles catalogue has not yet been released digitally, but steps are being made toward that goal.[1]
Most of the Beatles' albums were released in both mono and stereo. The first two albums, Please Please Me and With the Beatles, were mixed in mono only. Since mono record players were the most common at the time, producer George Martin and the Beatles gave more time and attention to preparing mono mixes of their recordings for most of their albums. By the late 1960s, stereo record players were more common; The Beatles' final two albums, Abbey Road and Let It Be, were originally mixed and released in stereo only.
The Beatles UK discography was released on CD in the late 1980s. For these, the first four albums were released in mono, and the remaining albums in stereo. However, the sound of the digital transfers of the current discs, produced by George Martin in 1987 and 1988 using the best equipment available during the early days of the format, no longer meet standards achievable using current techniques. Digital remasters of the Beatles' catalogue are currently in development.[2]
There are currently plans to release remastered versions of the Beatles catalogue according to Olivia Harrison, who claims that the plans are nearly complete.[3][4]

[edit] Official canon (UK discography)
This section lists the canon of material currently sanctioned by the Beatles as part of their official catalogue.[5] After the band's breakup, EMI, who controlled the Beatles material, "explored a range of repackaging schemes to exploit their Beatles catalogue",[6] without input from the Beatles themselves. It was not until "an agreement reached with EMI/Capitol in 1989... gave the Beatles control of future use of all their EMI recordings. This meant that any shoddy repackaging ideas... could now be nipped in the bud by Apple".[7] The canon of official Beatles releases include the following albums, EPs, and singles. The albums are currently all available on vinyl and CD. The EPs and singles have been made available as both vinyl and CD boxed sets but are currently deleted. All tracks are however available on CD albums.

[edit] Studio albums
The official canon of Beatles studio albums consists of the original albums as released in their native UK from 1962 to 1970. The single exception is Magical Mystery Tour, which was released as a 6-song double EP in the UK, but as a longer 11-song LP in the U.S. (the LP included singles and B-sides released during that year). When the Beatles catalogue was released on CD in the 1980s, the longer U.S. version was chosen for release and is now considered a part of their official catalogue.

Pos column indicates the peak position in the charts. Currently, all of the non-album singles can be collected on the Past Masters, Volumes One and Two discs (1988), the "Baby It's You" CD E.P. (1995), the "Free as a Bird" CD Single (1995), and the "Real Love" CD single (1996).

[edit] UK non-canon releases
This list reflects the various albums, EPs, and singles released in the UK which are not considered a part of the official Beatles catalogue as they were not authorised by Apple Corps. An agreement between Apple and EMI in 1989 meant EMI could no longer reissue any Beatles material without Apple's consent.

[edit] U.S. discography

[edit] U.S. albums
The first seven Beatles albums appeared in different versions in the U.S., where Capitol Records mixed UK album tracks with UK single tracks to create different albums altogether, with different titles, track listings, and often different audio mixes. The first eight of these records have been released on CD as The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 (2004) and The Capitol Albums, Volume 2 (2006). The Capitol release of Rubber Soul is preferred by some over its UK counterpart, due to its more folky flavour[citation needed]; it was this version of the album that greatly influenced the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, who "answered" it by releasing Pet Sounds in 1966[citation needed]. Upon the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967, the Beatles albums had the same track listing in both the U.S. and the U.K. (The only exception to this is Magical Mystery Tour, which was released as a double EP in the UK, and a longer LP in the U.S., and Hey Jude, which was comprised primarily of non-album songs.)

After this album, Capitol of Canada synchronised its catalogue production with the U.S. market, beginning with United Artists' A Hard Day's Night and concluding with Apple's Hey Jude. Notably, the albums Something New and The Beatles' Story were only produced in mono when originally released. In 1967 the American back catalogue was released in Canada:

The Beatles' Second Album, ST 2080 (Stereo)/ T 2080 (Mono), 1 February 1967
Meet The Beatles, ST 2047 (Stereo), 1 February 1967
Something New, ST 2108, 1 February 1967
The Beatles' Story, STBO 2222 (Stereo), 1 August 1968
The Early Beatles, ST 2309 (Stereo), 1 August 1968


[edit] Canadian compilations
All post-Beatles albums were released exactly the same in Canada as in the U.S., with the exception of:

Very Together, Polydor (Fall 1969)
The Beatles' Ballads, Capitol Records (1980-10-13)


[edit] Canadian singles
This reflects the Beatles singles which appeared on the "CHUM Hit Parade" charts between the weeks of Monday 6 January 1963 and Saturday 8 January 1977.[9] Capitol of Canada took on the Beatles early on and issued early singles in their 72000 series of Canada only releases[10] before aligning with the American company's numbering system when the American company began issuing Beatle singles. American Beatle recordings issued on the Vee-Jay, Swan and Tollie labels were issued by Capitol of Canada with 72000 series catalogue numbers. Capitol Canada was the only country outside of the U.K. to issue version 1 of "Love Me Do" with Ringo on the drums.

[edit] Christmas records
The Beatles also recorded annual Christmas records for their fan club members. From 1963 to 1969 these were released as 7" flexidiscs on LYN. In 1970 the 7 previous records were put onto a 12" vinyl record, From Then to You. In the United States, the 1964 and 1965 Christmas records were not released. In 1964, American fans received an edited copy of the 1963 record. In 1965, instead of a Christmas record, American fans received a postcard saying, "Seasons Greetings from the Beatles." Nothing was sent to American fans in 1963. These remain largely unavailable today (although they have been widely bootlegged), with the exception of one track, "Christmas Time Is Here Again", which was edited and released on the Free As a Bird CD single in 1994:

The Beatles Christmas Record, LYN 492 (1963)
Season's Greetings from The Beatles, LYN 757 (1964)
The Beatles 3rd Christmas Record, LYN 948 (1965)
Everywhere It's Christmas, LYN 1145 (1966)
Christmas Time Is Here Again, LYN 1360 (1967)
Beatles 1968 Christmas Record, LYN 1743/4 (1968)
Happy Christmas 1969, LYN 1970/1 (1969)
From Then to You, (UK) Apple LYN 2154 / The Beatles' Christmas Album (U.S.) Apple SBC 100 (1970)
