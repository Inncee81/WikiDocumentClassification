The NRS social grades are a system of demographic classification used in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. They were originally developed by the National Readership Survey in order to classify readers but are now used by many other organisations for wider applications and have become a standard for market research.[1]

[edit] The grades
The classifications are based on the occupation of the head of the household.[1]


Grade
Social class
Chief Income Earner's Occupation


A
upper middle class
Higher managerial, administrative or professional.


B
middle class
Intermediate managerial, administrative or professional


C1
lower middle class
Supervisory or clerical and junior managerial, administrative or professional


C2
skilled working class
Skilled manual workers


D
working class
Semi and unskilled manual workers


E
underclass
Casual or lowest grade workers, pensioners and others who depend on the welfare state for their income


The grades are often grouped into ABC1 and C2DE and these are taken to equate to middle class and working class respectively. Only around 2% of the UK population identifies as upper class,[2] and this group is not included in the classification scheme.
