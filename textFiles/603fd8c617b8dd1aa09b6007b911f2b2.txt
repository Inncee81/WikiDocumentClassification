Tsundere (ツンデレ ?) is a Japanese word for a character archetype which describes a person with a conceited, spiky, combative personality that suddenly becomes modest and loving when triggered by some sort of cause (such as being alone with someone). It can also describe a personality that is good-willed, but its attitude and actions often contradict its nature. Originally found in Japanese bishōjo games, the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon, reaching into other media such as anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.

[edit] Terminology
Tsundere is an Internet slang word that has a remarkable subdivision structure; usage rules vary accordingly. Therefore, the term is not elaborately defined as to what character types can be described as tsundere; the term transcends gender and species. The definition is often subjected to the creator's point of view.
Tsundere is a combination of the two words tsuntsun (ツンツン ?), and deredere (デレデレ ?). Tsuntsun is defined as "aloof, morose, pointed", and deredere is defined as "exhausted, lovestruck".[1] Tsunderekko (ツンデレっ娘 ?) is a related noun, referring to a girl with a tsundere personality. Like nekomimi, tsundere is considered a moe-inspiring character trait.[2] The concept has received increasing attention in Japan, with a tsundere cafe opened in Akihabara[3] and tsundere-themed products released (like Tomy Co.'s portable television set),[4] and the concept increasingly reflected in recent anime, from an extended discussion of the meaning of the concept and its origin on the internet in Lucky Star's Lucky Channel segment to merchandise for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya classifying the characters according to tsundere-ness.
One of the earliest examples of a tsundere is Sayaka Yumi from Mazinger Z. While this tsundere is a generally kind girl, she is initially resistant to accept romantic overtures and turns cold when the lead male Koji starts showing interest in other girls, and is known to sometimes become physically aggressive towards him.
