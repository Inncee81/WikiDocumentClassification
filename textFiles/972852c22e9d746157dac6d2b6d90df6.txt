MILAN (French: Missile d´infanterie léger antichar; English: Anti-Tank Light Infantry Missile, "milan" is French and German for "kite bird") is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962. It was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (Semi-Automatic Command to Line-Of-Sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA thermal sight, to give it night-firing ability.

[edit] History





Please help improve this article or section by expanding it. Further information might be found on the talk page. (November 2008)


MILAN is a French and German missile that has been license-built by the Italians, Spanish, British and Indians. As it is guided by wire by an operator, this missile can avoid most countermeasures (flares and chaffs). The drawbacks are its short range, the exposure of the operator, and that it requires a skilled and well-trained operator.

[edit] Warhead variants

MILAN: Single, Shaped Charge (1972)
MILAN 2: Single, Shaped Charge (1984)
MILAN 2T: Tandem, Shaped Charge (1993)
MILAN 3: Tandem, Shaped Charge (1996)
MILAN ER: Extended Range

The later MILAN models have tandem HEAT warheads. This was done to keep pace with developments in Soviet Armour technology. Soviet tanks began to appear with explosive reactive armor, which could defeat earlier ATGMs. The precursor HEAT warhead penetrates and detonates the ERA tiles, paving the way for the main charge to penetrate the armor behind.
