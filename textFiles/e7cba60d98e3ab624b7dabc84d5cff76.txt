Mathcore is a rhythmically complex and dissonant style of metalcore. It has its roots in bands like Converge,[1] Botch,[2][3] and the Dillinger Escape Plan.[4] The term mathcore is suggested by analogy with math rock. Both math rock and mathcore make use of unusual time signatures. Math rock groups such as Slint, Don Caballero, Shellac, and Drive Like Jehu have some influence on mathcore, though mathcore is more closely related to metalcore and grindcore. Prominent mathcore groups have been associated with grindcore.[5][6][7][8][9]

[edit] History
An early antecedent to mathcore was practiced by Black Flag, in 1984, with the album My War: "Its seven-minute metal dirges and fusion-style time signatures proved too much for many fans".[10] Many groups from the mathcore scene paid tribute to Black Flag for the album Black on Black.[11]




Dillinger Escape Plan on 28 March 2005 in the Effenaar (Eindhoven, The Netherlands)


Mathcore is an offshoot of math rock, which originated in the early 1990s. Math rock's convergence with metalcore inspires the portmanteau term: math rock with hardcore. The earliest known bands to record this hybrid include Rorschach, Starkweather, Botch and Converge. Throughout the 1990s, several other groups started to emerge: Cave In from Massachusetts, Cable from Connecticut, Coalesce from Kansas City, and Knut from Switzerland. The term mathcore was coined at the release of The Dillinger Escape Plan's 1999 debut album Calculating Infinity. The Dillinger Escape Plan is often considered the "pioneer" of mathcore.[12] The style had previously been referred to as "noisecore",[13][14] which confusingly also refers to a style of hardcore techno and an earlier outgrowth of grindcore.[15]
In the early 2000s several new mathcore bands started to emerge. These bands were rarely described as such, but were commonly related to mathcore pioneers or cited a major mathcore band as an influence. Norma Jean's earlier records are often compared to Converge and Botch[16][17] and are sometimes comically referred to as a "Botch rip-off".[18] Other new mathcore bands that cite older mathcore bands as an influence or are compared to one include The Locust,[19] Daughters,[20] Some Girls,[21] Fear Before the March of Flames,[22] Behold... The Arctopus,[23]and The Number Twelve Looks Like You.[24]

[edit] Style
Much like math rock, mathcore incorporates heavy usage of unusual time signatures, jarring tempo changes and unconventional song structure. The influence of metal and metalcore is what sets it apart as an extreme variation.
The term progressive metalcore is sometimes used interchangeably with mathcore, however it varies from mathcore in that it is used more to describe metalcore bands who are strongly influenced by progressive metal and rock bands. In general terms it is more a simple combination of the two genres. Mathcore is generic to bands who are heavily hardcore influenced also moving towards playing technical grindcore, with various experimental influences. Some examples of progressive metalcore bands would be The Human Abstract, Protest the Hero, SikTh, Shai Hulud, and Misery Signals.
