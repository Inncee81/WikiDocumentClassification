Look up framework in
Wiktionary, the free dictionary.


A framework is a basic conceptual structure used to solve or address complex issues. This very broad definition has allowed the term to be used as a buzzword, especially in a software context.
Framework can also refers to mechanical structures, such as scaffolding.
