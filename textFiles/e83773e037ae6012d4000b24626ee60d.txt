Don McLean singles chronology






"American Pie" (1971)
"Vincent"
(1972)





"American Pie" is a folk rock song by singer-songwriter Don McLean.
Recorded and released on the American Pie album in 1971, the single was a number-one U.S. hit for four weeks in 1972. A re-release in 1991 did not chart in the U.S., but reached number 12 in the UK. The song is an abstract story surrounding "The Day the Music Died"--the 1959 airplane crash that killed Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper (Giles Perry Richardson, Jr.). The importance of "American Pie" to America's musical and cultural heritage was recognized by the Songs of the Century education project which listed the song as the number five song of the twentieth century. Some Top 40 stations initially played only side two of the single, but the song's popularity eventually forced stations to play the entire piece.

[edit] Background and interpretation
The song's lyrics are the subject of much curiosity. Although McLean dedicated the American Pie album to Buddy Holly, none of the musicians in the plane crash are identified by name in the song itself. When asked what "American Pie" meant, McLean replied, "It means I never have to work again."[1] Later, he more seriously stated "You will find many interpretations of my lyrics but none of them by me... sorry to leave you all on your own like this but long ago I realized that songwriters should make their statements and move on, maintaining a dignified silence."[2] McLean has generally avoided responding to direct questions about the song lyrics ("They’re beyond analysis. They’re poetry.")[3] except to acknowledge that he did first learn about Buddy Holly's death while folding newspapers for his paper route on the morning of February 3, 1959 (the line "February made me shiver/with every paper I'd deliver"). He also stated in an editorial published on the 50th anniversary of the crash in 2009 that writing the first verse of the song exorcised his long-running grief over Holly's death.
Also, the line 'When Lenin read a book on Marx " possibly refers to Das Kapital, (written by Karl Marx) which Lenin read and then contributed to the communist Marxist theory. This successfully became known as Leninism. However, this interpretation is doubtful- considering that the song is about the evolution of Rock 'n' Roll, followed by the reference to the "quartet" (The Beatles) practicing in the park, it can be logically interpreted as a pun on the name Lennon, as in John Lennon. Many others have similarly interpreted the line as a reference to Lennon, this time with Groucho Marx, who were photographically paired together on the 1969 Firesign Theater album (cover), How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All which was issued two years earlier than the "Pie".
Despite this, many fans of McLean, amongst others, have attempted an interpretation (see Interpretation Links); at the time of the song's original release in late 1971, many American AM & FM rock radio stations released printed interpretations and some devoted entire shows discussing and debating the song's lyrics, resulting in both controversy and intense listener interest in the song. Some examples are the real-world identities of the "Jester", "King and Queen", "Satan", "Girl Who Sang the Blues" and other characters referenced in the verses. Speculation ranges from Bob Dylan, Elvis, Janis Joplin, and Mick Jagger.[4]

[edit] Notable cover versions
A few cover versions have been made over the years. The first English language cover version was by The Brady Bunch in 1972, but a Spanish translation sung by voice actor Francisco Colmenero surfaced around Mexico in 1971. A very significant version, also in Spanish, was recorded in 1984 by the Nicaraguan singer Hernaldo Zúñiga. (Eduardo Fonseca recorded a cover version of the translation in 2000.) Ska punk band Catch 22 made a ska version which became a staple of their live show, released in several versions. Alternative rock band Killdozer recorded a thrashing, ironic version of the song in 1989.
As heard on Live, Mott the Hoople opened mid-1970s concerts with singer Ian Hunter performing the first verse on solo piano up to the phrase the day the music died. Hunter would then add "or did it?", and the full band would segue into the next number.[5]
Tori Amos performed the song often as a piano solo in her live concerts, and country singer Garth Brooks also sang this song during concerts in the early to mid 1990s. During Brooks' "Live in Central Park" concert, he performed this song as a duet with McLean himself at the end of the concert. The audience, of over 100,000 people, was also invited to sing the chorus near the end of the song. He also covered the song during Barack Obama's "We Are One" inauguration celebration.
British a cappella group King's Singers covered the song for their 1993 album Good Vibrations.
Chris de Burgh covered the song in 2008 on the album Footsteps.
Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder has sung the chorus of "American Pie" over the outro music of "Daughter" during select live performances.
It was also the late Hong Kong pop superstar Leslie Cheung's breakthrough song.

Audio sample










file info · help





Madonna released a cover of the song for the soundtrack to the 2000 film The Next Best Thing. Madonna's cover however is noted for being much shorter in length (it contains only the beginning of the first verse and all of the second and sixth verses) and for being recorded as a pop-dance song.

[edit] Song history
Released in the spring of 2000, American Pie was a big worldwide hit, reaching #1 in many countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Finland. Ironically there was no commercial single release in the US, but the single still reached the #29 spot on The Billboard Hot 100, based on airplay alone. The song was added as a bonus track on Madonna's Music album (outside the US). This single was Madonna's first single of the 2000s.

[edit] Music video

The music video, directed by Philip Stolzl, pays tribute to the seventies in which the original song by Don McLean was recorded. It show several snaps of ordinary people; playing children, happy couples, a lonely woman in a store, etc. in splitscreens intercut with shots of Madonna dancing in front of a large American flag. Rupert Everett also features in the video and provided backing vocals in the song.

Former Grateful Dead keyboardist Tom Constanten played an adapted version of American Pie when opening for Jefferson Starship on August 9, 2005, the tenth anniversary of Jerry Garcia's death. Constanten altered the lyrics to allude to Jerry's death and how he heard the news by a phone call from Bruce Hornsby.
Finnish rock musician Hector (Heikki Harma) made a Finnish cover of the song "American Pie" in 1971, under the name Suomi-Neito (Maid Finland). While the original song covered the American issues, Hector's version was likewise "translated" to deal with the Finnish post WWII history and the loss of innocence in Finnish culture.
"American Diet" ("I'm too heavy for my Chevy; I belong in a sty..."), played on radio stations in Baltimore, MD during the late 1970s and early 80s.[citation needed] "The day the routers died" was written and performed by Gary Feldman at the conclusion of the RIPE 55 meeting.[6]
On That '70s Show, In the episode "Celebration Day (AKA Graduation Day)", (Season 5, episode 25),the character Michael Kelso uses the music of "American Pie" to create a song dedicated to Jackie Burkhart, and later claims that the "American Pie guy" stole the music from him.[citation needed]
At the 1984 Yale Law Revue, a satirical show performed by Yale Law Students, a parody entitled "The Year Yale Law School Died" featured entirely reworked lyrics, such as a reference to "The three men I admire least -- Jay Katz, Klevorick and George Priest."
A version of American Pie was adapted in 1997 to the first retirement of NHL legend, Mario Lemieux, entitled "Bye Bye, French-Canadian Guy". It was originally aired on Pittsburgh-based radio station, WDVE. Often, it is wrongfully credited to a Canadian parody band, The Arrogant Worms.
In 1998, the Christian parody band ApologetiX released a parody of the song, entitled "Parable Guy", about Jesus' ministries through the use of storytelling.
In 1999, "Weird Al" Yankovic did a Star Wars inspired lyrical adaptation of "American Pie". Entitled "The Saga Begins", the song recounts the plot of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace through the eyes of Obi-Wan Kenobi. While McLean gave permission for the parody, he did not make a cameo appearance in its video, despite popular rumour. McLean stated he was very pleased with the parody. He even admits to almost singing Yankovic's lyrics at live shows, due to the fact that his children played the song so often.[7][8]
The Jewish Summer Camp Song book, used at various Jewish summer camps in the Northeast USA, includes the song but changes the allusion to the trinity to "the three men I admire most, Abraham, Isaac, and Yaakov". It also changes the line "those old church bells were broken" to "those wacky synagogue bells were broken". In a season 2 episode of Roswell (TV series), Colin Hanks and Nick Wechsler - trapped in an underground cave filled with parasitic alien crystals and running out of oxygen - sing the song while Max, Liz, Isabelle, and Tess try to prevent them from being buried alive. The episode, entitled "How the Other Half Lives", aired on February 19, 2001, and was the fourteenth of the season.
In the Futurama Episode The Why of Fry, upon finding themselves trapped in a parallel universe for all eternity a race of alien 'brains' are at a loss for what to do. One brain suggested that they could sing American Pie to which a depressed Fry replied "Go on, I deserve it".
On season 4 on NBC's The Office on the episode "The Chair Model" Michael and Dwight sing American Pie at the cemetery mourning the death of the chair model with whom Michael was infatuated.
The final episode of series 11 of Bremner, Bird and Fortune features a dream sequence sung supposedly by Tony Blair with lyrics referring to New Labour:[citation needed]
In an episode[which?] of King Of The Hill, Hank remarks that "You never realize how American Pie is seven minutes long until your boss makes you sing it for karaoke."
Seattle radio disc jockey Bob Rivers produced a parody entitled "American Pie Eulogy" in which a singer impersonating Don McLean's voice laments, "Why did Madonna kill American Pie? / Well, it’s tragic, but this classic has been hung out to dry / She might as well have poked a sharp stick in my eye / She’s making all the neighbor dogs cry."[9]
The Don McLean recording was used in the films "The Next Best Thing" (1999) and "Born on the Fourth of July (film)" (1989).
