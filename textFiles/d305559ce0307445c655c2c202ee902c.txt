AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains is a list of the 100 greatest movie heroes and villains (50 of each) chosen by American Film Institute in June 2003. It is part of the AFI 100 Years... series. The series was first presented in a CBS special hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The presentation program was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Special.[1]
In several cases, the characters on the lists are seen in two or more films, but the terminator is the only character to appear as both a hero and a villain. The primary or original (if possible) film that character(s) was in is listed, or that film that was given particular attention during the program.
