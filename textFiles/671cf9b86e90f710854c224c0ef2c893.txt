Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS) is a demographic defining a particular market segment related to sustainable living, "green" ecological initiatives, and generally composed of a relatively upscale and well-educated population segment. Researchers have reported a range of sizes of the LOHAS market segment. For example, Worldwatch Institute reported that the LOHAS market segment in the year 2006 was estimated at $300 billion, approximately 30% of the USA consumer market;[1][2][3] and, a study by the Natural Marketing Institute showed that in 2007, 40 million Americans were included within the LOHAS demographic.[citation needed] Author Paul H. Ray, who coined the term Cultural Creatives in his book by the same name, explains that "What you're seeing is a demand for products of equal quality that are also virtuous."[4][5] Included in the cultural creative demographic are consumers of "new age" goods and services.[6][1]

[edit] Products and services
The marketplace includes goods and services such as:

Organic and locally grown food
Organic and natural personal care products
Hybrid and electric cars
Green and sustainable building
Energy efficient electronics/applicances
Socially responsible investing
Natural household products (paper goods and cleaning products)
Complementary, alternative and preventive medicine (Naturopathic, Chinese medicine, etc.)

[edit] Scope
LOHAS is a recognised market segment in the USA, Western Europe[7] and South East Asia. Progressive Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and Taiwan have similarly aligned interests.
The Japanese government recently launched "Cool Biz", a campaign that encouraged offices to allow their workers to remove the tie and adopt light-colored business suits. This made great a contribution to the environment as offices adjusted their themostats up to 28 degree Celsius, subject to the government's instruction.
