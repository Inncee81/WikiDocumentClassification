[edit] Themes
The book describes the socio-political tactic of creating temporary spaces that elude formal structures of control.[1] The essay uses various examples from history and philosophy, all of which suggest that the best way to create a non-hierarchical system of social relationships is to concentrate on the present and on releasing one's own mind from the controlling mechanisms that have been imposed on it.
In the formation of a TAZ, Bey argues, information becomes a key tool that sneaks into the cracks of formal procedures. A new territory of the moment is created that is on the boundary line of established regions. Any attempt at permanence that goes beyond the moment deteriorates to a structured system that inevitably stifles individual creativity. It is this chance at creativity that is real empowerment.
Bey later expanded the concept beyond the "temporary," saying "we've had to consider the fact that not all existing autonomous zones are 'temporary.' Some are ... more-or-less 'permanent.'"[2] Hence, the concept of the Permanent Autonomous Zone.
The titular section is divided up into the following subsections:

Pirate Utopias
Waiting for the Revolution
The Psychotopology of Everyday Life
The Net and the Web
"Gone to Croatan"
Music as an Organizational Principle
The Will To Power as Disappearance
Ratholes in the Babylon of Information

The ideas which inspired the "Gone to Croatan" chapter—i.e. the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony—were later used as the basis for the book Gone To Croatan: The Origins of North American Dropout Culture, edited by Ron Sakolsky and James Koehnline.

[edit] Use in music
The 1992 album Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis) by Praxis features quotes from TAZ in its liner notes.
Bill Laswell produced an album featuring Hakim Bey reading excerpts from TAZ with music by Material featuring Wu Man, Nicky Skopelitis, and Buckethead. It was released by Axiom in 1994. The six tracks were: "Chaos", "Poetic Terrorism", and "Amour Fou" (all from "Chaos: The Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchism"), "Immediatism", and "The Tong" (both from the book Immediatism), and "Boycott Cop Culture" (from "Communiques of the Association for Ontological Anarchy").
Bey's line "art as crime; crime as art" from "Poetic Terrorism" was sampled by Negativland in their song "Downloading" from their album No Business.
Polish rock band TSA is named after the Polish translation of T.A.Z..

[edit] Implementations
The concept of TAZ was first put into practice on a large scale by the Cacophony Society in what they called Trips to the Zone, or Zone Trips. One of their Zone Trips gave birth to Black Rock City, also called the Burning Man Festival.
Smart mobs and flash mobs are also examples of the concept of TAZ put into practice, if only very briefly.

Raves, too, once implemented the TAZ philosophical idea, in a similar concept to the Burning Man Festival, until PLUR (Peace Love Unity Respect) became the dominant philosophical trend.
