This article is about the acronym.  For other uses, see Snafu.
SNAFU is an acronym meaning, "Situation Normal; All Fucked Up". It is sometimes bowdlerized to "Situation Normal: All Fouled Up" or similar,[1] in circumstances where profanity is discouraged or censored. In modern usage, "snafu" is often used as an interjection, as a shorthand for the sentiment expressed by the phrase. "Snafu" is also sometimes used as a noun or verb, referring to a situation that suddenly went awry, or the cause of the trouble. The acronym is believed to have originated in the US Army during World War II.

[edit] Date of origin
SNAFU, simply defined as "situation normal" and used in a military context, was first recorded in American Notes and Queries in their September 1941 issue.[2] Time magazine used the term in their June 15, 1942 issue: "Last week U.S. citizens knew that gasoline rationing and rubber requisitioning were snafu."[2] Most reference works, including the Random House Unabridged Dictionary, supply an origin date of 1940-1944, generally attributing it to the U.S. Army. Rick Atkinson, in The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944 (The Liberation Trilogy) ascribes the origin of SNAFU, FUBAR and a bevy of others to cynical GI's ridiculing the Army's penchant for acronyms.
At least three songs from that era can be traced that either are titled "SNAFU" or feature "SNAFU" as part of discussion.

Leonard Feather/Shorty Sherock's SNAFU — a jazz instrumental composition. [3]
Glenn Miller's SNAFU Jump. [4]
Carole Landis and Martha Raye performed a skit about SNAFU sometime during the war. [5]

The Army produced training cartoons during WWII featuring a character called Private Snafu who always did the wrong thing.
