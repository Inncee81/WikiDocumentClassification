The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), formed in 1991, is a democratic, international organization. Its members are indigenous peoples, occupied nations, minorities and independent states or territories which lack representation internationally. The organization educates groups in what channels to use to make their voices heard, and helps defuse tensions so that frustrated groups do not turn to violence to gain attention for their demands. Some former members, like Armenia, Estonia, Latvia and the country of Georgia, have gained full independence and joined the United Nations.[1][2]
UNPO aims to protect the members' human and cultural rights, preserve their environments, and to find non-violent solutions to conflicts which affect them. UNPO provides a forum for member aspirations and assists its members to participate at an international level.
UNPO members are generally not represented diplomatically (or only with a minor status, such as observer) in major international institutions, such as the United Nations. As a result, their ability to have their concerns addressed by the global bodies mandated to protect human rights and address conflict is limited.
UNPO is dedicated to the five principles enshrined in its Covenant:

The equal right to self-determination;
Adherence to the internationally accepted human rights standards as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments;
Adherence to the principles of democratic pluralism and rejection of totalitarianism and religious intolerance;
Promotion of non-violence and the rejection of terrorism as an instrument of policy; and
Protection of the natural environment.

All members are required to sign and abide by the UNPO Covenant. They must affirm that they support the principle of nonviolence in their people’s struggle for a peaceful solution and that they apply the democratic methodology as their guiding principle. Despite the "UN" in its acronym, UNPO is an NGO and not an agency of the United Nations.

[edit] Criticism
Valery Tishkov, the Director of the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology at the Russian Academy of Sciences and former Russian Minister for nationalities, criticized the UNPO by stating:

The UNPO's activities in The Hague took a different track when the flags of separatist regimes and organizations that emerged after the collapse of the USSR and Yugoslavia were hoisted above its headquarters. In the context of new geopolitical rivalries and western euphoria about rebuilding the post-communist world, "unrepresentedness" came to be seen as a breach of order rather than an improvement, as a process of exiting the system rather than finding one's voice within it.[2]
