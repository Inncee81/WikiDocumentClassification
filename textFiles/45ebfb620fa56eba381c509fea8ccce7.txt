Named entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify atomic elements in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
Most research on NER systems has been structured as taking an unannotated block of text, such as this one:

Jim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006.

And producing an annotated block of text, such as this one:

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> bought <NUMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">300</NUMEX> shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Acme Corp.</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</TIMEX>.

In this example, the annotations have been done using so-called ENAMEX tags that were developed for the Message Understanding Conference in the 1990s.
State-of-the-art NER systems produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of f-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%. These results indicate the algorithms had roughly twice the error rate (6.61%) as human annotators (2.40% and 3.05%).

[edit] Approaches
NER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better results, but at the cost of months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data.

[edit] Problem Domains
Research indicates that NER systems developed for one domain do not typically perform well on other domains.[1].
Early work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities. The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products.

[edit] Named Entity types
In the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, stands for the referent. For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 is referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company. Rigid designators include proper names as well as certain natural kind terms like biological species and substances.
There is a general agreement to include temporal expressions and some numerical expressions (i.e., money, percentages, etc.) as instances of named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in “June”). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, June 2020, etc.). It is arguable that the named entity definition is loosened in such cases for practical reasons.
At least two hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories [1], proposed in 2002, is used for Question Answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy [2], proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes.

[edit] NER Evaluation Forums
Evaluation of NER systems is critical to scientific progress of this field.
Most evaluation of these systems has been performed at conferences or contests put on by government organizations, sometimes acting in concert with contractors or academics.
