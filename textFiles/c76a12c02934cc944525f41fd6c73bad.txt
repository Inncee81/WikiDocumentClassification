RT's ticket list interface






An individual RT ticket


Request Tracker, commonly abbreviated to RT, is a ticket-tracking system written in Perl used to coordinate tasks and manage requests among a community of users. RT's first release was in 1996, written by Jesse Vincent, who later formed Best Practical Solutions LLC to distribute, develop and support the package. Distributed under the GNU General Public License,[1] Request Tracker is free software.
RT's primary customer-facing interface is email, while its employee-facing interface is Web-based via the Apache HTTP server or any other web server or RT own webserver. Sites using RT can often be identified by the subject line of their email autoresponses, which take the form "[domain-name #ticket-number]". For example, ticket 330 from the RT instance used at example.com would contain "[example.com #330]" in its subject line.
Among others, RT is used by NASA, MIT, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Rice University IT, Boston University's CAS Computing Services Group, University of Washington, Yale University, Lakehead University TSC, University of Maine, Brandeis University's Library and Technology Services, Evare LLC, Princeton University Department of Computer Science, and Merrill Lynch and acts as the centralized bug reporting system for both the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and Perl 5/6 itself.
RT integrates with Best Practical's knowledge base application, "RTFM".[2]
