Microsoft Expression Blend is a user interface design tool developed and sold by Microsoft for creating graphical interfaces for web and desktop applications that blend the features of these two types of applications.

[edit] Availability
Expression Blend was code-named Sparkle, and originally the product was announced as Microsoft Expression Interactive Designer, before it was renamed Expression Blend in December 2006.
On January 24, 2007, Microsoft released the first public Community Technology Preview of Expression Blend as a free download on their web site. The final version was released to manufacturing along with other Expression products on 30 April, 2007. The RTM news was announced at Microsoft's MIX 07 conference for web developers and designers. [1] Expression Blend Service Pack 1 was released in November 2007. [2] Expression Blend requires .NET Framework 3.0. Expression Blend and Expression Web are also available as part of the MSDN Premium subscription.
The latest version, Expression Blend 2.0 is available which supports developing Microsoft Silverlight browser-based Rich Internet Applications providing animation, vector graphics, interactivity and video playback capabilities. Version 2.0 supported only Silverlight 1.0 applications at release and Microsoft had planned Blend 2.5 for Silverlight 2.0 applications, however the capabilities of the preview version 2.5 have been added to Blend 2.0 Service Pack 1.
A trial version of Expression Blend is available. [3]
Expression Blend 3 Preview is available March 18, 2009. New features include SketchFlow, support for PSD and AI files, TFS support and number of other significant improvements.[4]
