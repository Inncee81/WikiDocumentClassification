From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) is a de facto application programming interface standard for publishing libraries to perform basic linear algebra operations such as vector and matrix multiplication. They were first published in 1979, and are used to build larger packages such as LAPACK. Heavily used in high-performance computing, highly optimized implementations of the BLAS interface have been developed by hardware vendors such as by Intel as well as by other authors (e.g. ATLAS is a portable self-optimizing BLAS). The LINPACK benchmark relies heavily on DGEMM, a BLAS subroutine, for its performance.

[edit] Functionality
The BLAS functionality is divided into three levels: 1, 2 and 3.

[edit] Level 1
This level contains vector operations of the form



as well as scalar dot products and vector norms, among other things.

[edit] Level 2
This level contains matrix-vector operations of the form



as well as solving  for x with T being triangular, among other things.

[edit] Level 3
This level contains matrix-matrix operations of the form



as well as solving  for triangular matrices T, among other things. This level contains the widely used General Matrix Multiply operation.

[edit] Implementations

refblas
The official reference implementation from netlib. C and Fortran 77 versions are available.[1]
Accelerate
Apple Computer's framework for Mac OS X, which includes tuned versions of BLAS and LAPACK for both PowerPC and Intel Core processors.[2]
