[edit] Live CD
dyne:bolic is designed from ground up to be used as Live CD. It does not require installation to a hard drive, and attempts to recognize most devices and peripherals automatically (for example: sound, video, TV, etc). Its kernel is highly optimized for low latency and high performance, making it suitable for audio and video production.
dyne:bolic is not based on any other existing Live CD technology. Basic system requirements are relatively low: a PC with a Pentium MMX (i586) class CPU and 64 MB of RAM is sufficient. Some versions of dyne:bolic can be used on an Xbox game console (Xbox is not currently supported by v2.0).

[edit] Installation
Windows and Linux installation is simple and direct. The user copies the dyne directory from the CD (described in db literature as "Docking") to any suitably formatted partition or drive. This filesystem will be recognised and booted by the CD, or there is the option to install a bootloader or edit an existing one. Booting from floppy disk is also supported. Dyne:bolic can save user settings in a file on a partition (or even user's own USB flash drive) which can also be encrypted for better privacy (described as "Nesting" in the db literature). Xfce is used as the desktop interface (Window Maker was used before 2.4).

[edit] Multimedia Support
dyne:bolic has been shaped by the needs of media activists, artists and creators, to be a practical tool for multimedia production.[4] It allows manipulation and broadcast of both sound and video with tools to record, edit, encode, and stream. In addition to many multimedia specific programs, dyne:bolic also provides word processors and common desktop computing tools.
The dyne:bolic author and maintainer Jaromil has also created various multimedia tools included in the distribution: MuSE, HasciiCam, FreeJ, as well as other software functionalities such as the nesting and docking, while co-developer and friend, Smilzo contributed the port for Xbox game consoles.

[edit] Modules
dyne:bolic can be extended by downloading extra modules such as development tools and OpenOffice. The modules are placed in the modules folder of a dock (see above) or a CD and are automatically integrated at boot.

[edit] New Features
The latest versions contain many JACK Audio Connection Kit applications and can automatically turn a network of computers into an openMosix cluster on booting for instant network-wide CPU clustering. This powerful feature allows a network of machines to work as a distributed supercomputing environment, and can be thought of as an out-of-the-box Render Farm supporting additional features useful in CPU-intensive environments.
A new feature in versions 2.0 and above is that it is truly "Live". Most Live CD distributions are often a demo of Linux, and to have new software, one will have to wait for a new version. dyne:II is designed to be a truly "live" CD. Basically, Dyne:II is a core; while it can be run live as-is, it is also designed to be customized by placing additional modules (dynemodules) into the ISO image, so that it may truly suit the users' needs.
An example would be pure:dyne, formerly based on the dyne:II core.
The main improvements in dyne:II are:

No longer just booting to root, dyne:II is a now a True Multiuser system in the Linux & UNIX Tradition.
Inclusion of development tools, including a compiler which can rebuild dyne:II.
More modifications to user settings are allowed.
Modular software add-ons are now available.

The current stable version is 2.5.2 and uses Linux 2.6. Version 1.4.1 (using Linux 2.4) is provided for Xbox use.
