The Japanese Language Proficiency Test (日本語能力試験 ,nihongo nōryoku shiken?), or JLPT, is a standardized criterion-referenced test to evaluate and certify the Japanese language proficiency of non-native speakers. It is held twice a year in East Asia and once a year in other regions.[2] The JLPT has four levels, with Level 4 the most basic and Level 1 the most difficult. The Japan Foundation estimates that approximately 150 hours of study are necessary to pass the Level 4 exam and 900 hours of study are required to pass the Level 1 test,[3] although the figures may be significantly higher for native English speakers. In 2008, the Japanese government announced a plan under consideration to use the JLPT to screen applicants for long-term and permanent resident visas.[4]

[edit] History and statistics
The JLPT was first held in 1984 in response to growing demand for standardized Japanese language certification. Initially 7,000 people took the test.[5] Until 2003, the JLPT was one of the requirements for foreigners entering Japanese universities. Since 2003, the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students (EJU) is used by most universities for this purpose;[6] unlike the JLPT, which is solely a multiple-choice exam, the EJU contains sections which require the examinee to write in Japanese.
In 2004, the JLPT was offered in 40 countries, including Japan. Of the 302,198 examinees in that year, 47% (around 140,000) were certified for their respective level.[7] The number of examinees continues to rise, as 523,958 examinees took the test in 2007,[8] while the percentage of candidates certified has fallen below 36%.[9]

[edit] Administration
In Japan, the JLPT is administered by the Ministry of Education[10] through the Japan Educational Exchanges and Services (JEES). Overseas, the Japan Foundation co-sponsors the administration of the test with local cultural exchange and/or educational institutions, or with committees specially established for this purpose.[11][12]

[edit] Format
All instructions on the test are written in Japanese, although their difficulty is adjusted to remain appropriate to each test level.[13] The subject matter covered at each level of the examination is based upon the Test Content Specification (出題基準 ,Shutsudai kijun?). The Test Content Specification was first published in 1994 and revised in 2004; it serves as a reference for examiners to compile test questions, rather than as a study guide for students. The test specification consists of kanji lists, expression lists, vocabulary lists, and grammar lists for all four JLPT levels. However, about 20% of the kanji, vocabulary, and grammar in any one exam may be drawn from outside the prescribed lists at the discretion of exam compilers.[14]

[edit] Test sections
The JLPT is divided into three sections: "Characters and Vocabulary" (100 points), "Listening Comprehension" (100 points), and "Reading Comprehension and Grammar" (200 points).
The first section (文字･語彙, moji, goi) tests knowledge of vocabulary and various aspects of the Japanese writing system. This includes identifying the correct kanji characters for given situations, selecting the correct hiragana readings for given kanji, choosing the appropriate terms for given sentences, and choosing the appropriate usage of given words.
The second section (聴解, chōkai) comprises two sub-sections that test listening comprehension. The first involves choosing the picture which best represents the situation presented by a prerecorded conversation. The second is of a similar format but presents no visual cues.
Section three (読解･文法, dokkai, bunpō) uses authentic or semi-authentic reading passages of various lengths to test reading comprehension. Questions include prompts to fill in blank parts of the text and requests to paraphrase key points. Grammar questions request that examinees select the correct grammar structure to convey a given point or test conjugations and postpositional particle agreement.

[edit] Results
All examinees receive a report including a breakdown of their score for each section of the test. Those who pass also receive a Certificate of Proficiency. Exams take several months to process, hence results are announced the following February for examinees in Japan, and March for overseas candidates. Test results are given to the examinee through the testing organization or centre to which they applied.[15]

[edit] Revised test
A new and revised test pattern, originally scheduled to be implemented from December 2009, has been postponed until 2010. The revised test will consist of five levels: N1, N2, N3, N4, and N5, with N1 being the highest level and N5 the easiest.

N1: the same passing level as the original level 1, but able to gauge slightly more advanced skills, possibly through equating of test scores[16]
N2: the same as the original level 2
N3: in between the original level 2 and level 3
N4: the same as the original level 3
N5: the same as the original level 4

The revised test will continue to test the same categories as the original, but the first and third sections of the test will be combined into a single section.[17] It will not test oral or writing skills.[5]
