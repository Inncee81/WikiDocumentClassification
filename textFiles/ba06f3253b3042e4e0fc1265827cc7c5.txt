From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Agile Modeling is a practice-based methodology for modeling and documentation of software-based systems. It is intended to be a collection of values, principles, and practices for modeling software that can be applied on a software development project in a more flexible manner than traditional modeling methods.
Agile Modeling is a supplement to other Agile methodologies such as:

Extreme Programming ("XP")
Agile Unified Process
Scrum

In which it is used to replace the more standard UML, or other standard design tools.

[edit] Answers to Criticisms
The principles and values of Agile Modeling practices are intended to help mitigate the perceived flaws of Agile Software Development. The principle "Maximize Stakeholder Value" aims to inspire the developer to collaborate with the customer in providing an adequate level of documentation.
The principle "Model With Others" attempts to involve project stakeholders such as the client or customer in the modeling process to attempt to bring the model more into line with the end user requirements.

[edit] Limitations
There is significant dependence on face-to-face communication and customer collaboration. Agile Modeling is difficult to apply where there are large teams (in Agile methodologies 'large' is typically considered as anything more than around 8), team members are not co-located, or people skills are lacking. However, Agile Modeling can be scaled with agile architecture techniques.[citation needed]
