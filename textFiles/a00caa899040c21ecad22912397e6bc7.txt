Nagios, originally created under the name NetSaint, was written and is currently maintained by Ethan Galstad, along with a group of developers actively maintaining both official and unofficial plugins.
Nagios was originally designed to run under Linux, but also runs well on other Unix variants.

[edit] Overview

Monitoring of network services (SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, ICMP, SNMP, FTP, SSH)
Monitoring of host resources (processor load, disk usage, system logs) on a majority of network operating systems, including Microsoft Windows with the NRPE_NT plugins or with the NSCLIENT++ plugin.
Monitoring of anything else like probes (temperature, alarms...) which have the ability to send collected data via a network to specifically written plugins
Remote monitoring supported through SSH or SSL encrypted tunnels.
Simple plugin design that allows users to easily develop their own service checks depending on needs, by using the tools of choice (shell scripts, C++, Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, C#, etc.)
Parallelized service checks available
Ability to define network host hierarchy using "parent" hosts, allowing detection of and distinction between hosts that are down and those that are unreachable
Contact notifications when service or host problems occur and get resolved (via e-mail, pager, SMS, or any user-defined method through plugin system)
Ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events for proactive problem resolution
Automatic log file rotation
Support for implementing redundant monitoring hosts
Optional web-interface for viewing current network status, notifications, problem history, log files, etc.


[edit] Nagios meaning
N.A.G.I.O.S. is a recursive acronym: "Nagios Ain't Gonna Insist On Sainthood"[3]. "Sainthood" is a reference to the original name of the software, "NetSaint", which was changed in response to a legal challenge by owners of a similar trademark.[4] The word Nagios is a portmanteau of two words, network and hagios (also spelled agios) which means saint in Greek.[citation needed]
