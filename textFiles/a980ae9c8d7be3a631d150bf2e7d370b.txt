For the United States communal reading program, see One City One Book.
The Big Read can refer to either a 2003 survey carried out by the BBC,[1] or a program sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts.[2] In addition, a dubious blog meme has circulated that purports to originate with the Big Read, though the origins of the given list are more likely from a World Book Day survey.[3]

[edit] BBC version
The BBC started the Big Read with the goal of finding the "Nation's Best-loved Book" by way of a viewer vote via the Web, SMS, and telephone. The show attracted controversy[citation needed] for adopting an allegedly sensationalist approach to literature, but supporters[who?] praised it for raising the public awareness of reading. The British public voted originally for any book that they wished. From this, a list of 200 was drawn up, with the highest 21 then put forward for further voting, on the provision that only one book per author was permitted in the top 21.
Contests similar to Big Read were held in other countries:

My Favourite Book in Australia
Das große Lesen in Germany
A Nagy Könyv ("The Big Book") in Hungary
Голямото четене ("The Big Read") in Bulgaria
