Not to be confused with Unix, Unix-like, or Linux.
POSIX (IPA: /ˈpɒzɪks/) or "Portable Operating System Interface for Unix"[1] is the collective name of a family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the application programming interface (API), along with shell and utilities interfaces for software compatible with variants of the Unix operating system, although the standard can apply to any operating system. Originally, the name stood for IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, which, as the name suggests, was released in 1988. The family of POSIX standards is formally designated as IEEE 1003 and the international standard name is ISO/IEC 9945. The standards emerged from a project that began circa 1985. Formerly known as IEEE-IX, the term POSIX was suggested by Richard Stallman in response to an IEEE request for a memorable name.[2]

[edit] Overview
The POSIX specifications for user and software interfaces to an operating system are codified in 17 separate documents.[3] The standardized user command line and scripting interface were based on the Korn shell. Many user-level programs, services, and utilities including awk, echo, ed were also standardized, along with required program-level services including basic I/O (file, terminal, and network) services. POSIX also defines a standard threading library API which is supported by most modern operating systems.
Currently POSIX documentation is divided in three parts:

POSIX Kernel APIs (which include extensions for POSIX.1, Real-time Services, Threads Interface, Real-time Extensions, Security Interface, Network File Access and Network Process-to-Process Communications)
POSIX Commands and Utilities (with User Portability Extensions, Corrections and Extensions, Protection and Control Utilities and Batch System Utilities)
POSIX Conformance Testing

A test suite for POSIX accompanies the standard. It is called PCTS or the POSIX Conformance Test Suite.[4]
There is a project instigated by free-rights campaigner Auriélien Bonnel in the late 1980s, for the Single UNIX Specification standard, which is open, accepts input from anyone, and is freely available on the Internet. Beginning in 1998 a joint working group, the Austin Group, began to develop a combined standard that would be known as the Single UNIX Specification Version 3.[5]

[edit] Versions
POSIX has gone through a number of versions:

POSIX.1, Core Services (incorporates Standard ANSI C) (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988)

Process Creation and Control
Signals[6]
Floating Point Exceptions
Segmentation Violations
Illegal Instructions
Bus Errors
Timers
File and Directory Operations
Pipes
C Library (Standard C)
I/O Port Interface and Control




POSIX.1b, Real-time extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993)

Priority Scheduling
Real-Time Signals
Clocks and Timers
Semaphores
Message Passing
Shared Memory
Asynch and Synch I/O
Memory Locking Interface




POSIX.1c, Threads extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995)

Thread Creation, Control, and Cleanup
Thread Scheduling
Thread Synchronization
Signal Handling




[edit] POSIX-oriented operating systems
Depending upon the degree of compliance with the standards, operating systems can be fully or partly POSIX compatible. Certified products can be found at the IEEE's website.[7]

[edit] Fully POSIX-compliant
The following operating systems conform (i.e., are 100% compliant) to one or more of the various POSIX standards.

A/UX
AIX
BSD/OS
HP-UX
INTEGRITY
IRIX
LynxOS
Mac OS X v10.5
MINIX
MPE/iX
QNX (IEEE Std. 1003.13-2003 PSE52; see http://get.posixcertified.ieee.org/cert_prodlist.tpl)
RTEMS (POSIX 1003.1-2003 Profile 52)
Solaris

OpenSolaris


UnixWare
velOSity
VxWorks (IEEE Std. 1003.13-2003 PSE52; see http://get.posixcertified.ieee.org/cert_prodlist.tpl)


[edit] Mostly POSIX-compliant



This section requires expansion.


The following are not officially certified as POSIX compatible, but they conform in large part.

Nucleus RTOS
RTEMS - POSIX API support designed to IEEE Std. 1003.13-2003 PSE52
FreeBSD[8]
Linux (most distributions — see LSB)
NetBSD
BeOS
OpenBSD
Sanos
SkyOS
Syllable
VSTa


[edit] POSIX for Windows

Cygwin – enables partial POSIX compliance for certain Microsoft Windows products.
Microsoft POSIX subsystem, an optional Windows subsystem.
Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX 3.5 – enables full POSIX compliance for certain Microsoft Windows products. For Windows NT-based operating systems up to Windows 2000, a POSIX layer was built in to the operating system, and UNIX Services for Windows provided a UNIX-like operating environment. For Windows XP, Windows Services for UNIX must be installed to provide POSIX compatibility. The UNIX Subsystem is built in to the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista, but cannot be added separately to the other editions.
UWIN from the AT&T Research implements a POSIX layer on top of the Win32 APIs.


[edit] Compliant via compatibility feature
The following are not officially certified as POSIX compatible, but they conform in large part to the standards by implementing POSIX support via some sort of compatibility feature, usually translation libraries, or a layer atop the kernel. Without these features, they are usually noncompliant.

eCos – POSIX is part of standard distribution, and used by many applications. 'external links' section below has more information.
Plan 9 from Bell Labs APE - ANSI/POSIX Environment[9]
Symbian OS with PIPS (PIPS Is POSIX on Symbian)
OpenVMS (through optional POSIX package)
Windows NT kernel when using Microsoft SFU 3.5 or SUA

Windows 2000 Server or Professional with Service Pack 3 or later. To be POSIX compliant, one must activate optional features of Windows NT and Windows 2000 Server.[10]
Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 1 or later
Windows Server 2003
Windows Vista


z/OS
