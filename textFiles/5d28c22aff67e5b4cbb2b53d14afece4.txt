[edit] Early life
Sid Vicious was born Simon John Ritchie in London to John and Anne Ritchie. Anne was a hippie, whereas his father was a guard at Buckingham Palace.[3] Shortly after his birth, John Ritchie left the family. Simon ("Sid") and his mother moved to the island of Ibiza. She married Christopher Beverley in 1965 before setting up a family home back in Kent. Sid had taken his stepfather's surname and became John Beverly.
His stepfather died six months later, and by 1968 Ritchie and his mother were living in a rented flat in Tunbridge Wells where he attended Sandown Court School. In 1971 the pair moved to Hackney in East London. He also spent some time living in Somerset where he was a pupil at Clevedon Secondary Modern.
According to the band's photographer, Dennis Morris, Ritchie was "deep down, a shy person."[4] However, he did assault NME journalist Nick Kent with a motorcycle chain with help from Jah Wobble.[5] On another occasion, at The Speakeasy (a London nightclub popular with rock stars of the day) he threatened BBC DJ and Old Grey Whistle Test presenter Bob Harris.
Ritchie was given the nickname "Sid Vicious" by John Lydon, after Lydon's pet hamster. The hamster had bitten Ritchie, who said that "[Rotten's] Sid is really vicious!" [6] The animal was described by Lydon as "the softest, furriest, weediest thing on earth."[7] At the time, Ritchie was squatting with Lydon, John Wardle and John Gray.
According to John Lydon, the two of them would often busk for money with Sid playing the tambourine. They would play Alice Cooper covers and people gave them money to be quiet.[8]

[edit] Music career

[edit] The Flowers of Romance, and The Banshees
Vicious began his musical career in 1976 as a member of The Flowers of Romance along with former co-founding member of The Clash, Keith Levene (who later co-founded John Lydon's post-Pistols project Public Image Limited) and Palmolive and Viv Albertine, who would later form The Slits. He appeared with Siouxsie & the Banshees, playing drums at their notorious first gig at the 100 Club Punk Festival in London's Oxford Street. According to members of The Damned, Sid, along with Dave Vanian, was considered for the position of lead singer for the Damned, but failed to show up for the audition.[9]

[edit] Sex Pistols
Before joining the band, Sid had associations with The Bromley Contingent, the fashion avant garde that followed the Sex Pistols. According to various publications (such as the biography England's Dreaming by John Savage) and films (namely The Filth and the Fury) Ritchie was asked to join the group after Glen Matlock's departure in February 1977 due to his being present at every gig. Manager Malcolm McLaren once claimed "if Rotten is the voice of punk, then Vicious is the attitude."
McLaren also said in person, and in a documentary, that if he'd met Sid before he had hired Johnny to be the singer, Sid would have been the Sex Pistols front man, because he had the most charisma of anyone on that stage. Alan Jones described Sid as "[having] the iconic punk look (...) Sid, on image alone, is what all punk rests on."[10] His nails would be painted in a sloppy manner with purple nail polish [11]. Ritchie played his first gig with the Pistols on 3 April 1977, at the Screen on the Green in London. His debut was filmed by Don Letts and appears in Punk Rock Movie.
In November 1977, Ritchie met American groupie Nancy Spungen, and they immediately began a relationship (Spungen had come to London looking for Jerry Nolan of The Heartbreakers). She was a heroin addict, and Ritchie, who already believed in his own "live fast, die young" image, soon shared the dependence. Although they were deeply in love, their often violent and rocky relationship had a disastrous effect on the Sex Pistols. Both the group and Ritchie visibly deteriorated during their 1978 American tour. The Pistols broke up in San Francisco after their concert at the Winterland Ballroom on 14 January 1978. With Spungen acting as his "manager," Ritchie embarked on a solo career during which he performed with musicians including Mick Jones of The Clash, original Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock, Rat Scabies of The Damned and the New York Dolls' Arthur Kane, Jerry Nolan, and Johnny Thunders. Ritchie performed the majority of his solo performances at Max's Kansas City and drew large crowds. His final performances as a solo musician took place at Max's.[12]

[edit] Musicianship
Sid was not recognized as a competent bass player. During an interview for Guitar Hero III, when Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones was asked why he instead of Vicious recorded the bass parts of Never Mind The Bollocks, Jones responded, "Sid was in a hospital with hepatitis so he couldn't really play, not that he could play anyway."[13] Sid asked Lemmy, the bassist of Motörhead, to teach him how to play bass with the words, "I can't play bass," to which Lemmy replied "I know." In another interview Lemmy stated "Yeah. It was all uphill. And he still couldn't play bass when he died."[14]
According to Paul Cook, in the few months between joining the band and meeting Nancy, Sid was a dedicated worker and tried his hardest to learn to play; indeed, this period was Cook's favorite in the band [15]. Viv Albertine went further in defense of his ability, saying that one night she "went to bed, and Sid stayed up with a Ramones album and a bass guitar, and when I got up in the morning, he could play. He'd taken a load of speed and taught himself. He was so quick" [16].

[edit] Spungen's death
On the morning of 12 October 1978, Vicious claimed to have awoken from a drugged stupor to find Spungen dead on the bathroom floor of their room (number 100) in the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan, New York. She had suffered a single stab wound to her abdomen and apparently bled to death. On 22 November 1978 he was arrested and charged with her murder. Vicious said they had fought that night, but gave conflicting versions of what happened next, saying "I stabbed her but I didn't mean to kill her", then saying he didn't remember and at one point arguing Spungen had fallen onto the knife.
Bail of $50,000 was arranged by his mother.
On 22 October, 10 days after Spungen's death, Vicious attempted suicide by slicing his wrist, and subsequently became a patient at Bellevue Hospital for 72 hours. Some time after leaving hospital he was charged with assault after an altercation with Todd Smith (singer Patti Smith's brother). Vicious was arrested 9 December 1978 and sent to Riker's Island jail for 55 days. He was released on bail on 1 February 1979.

[edit] Death
On the evening of 1 February 1979, a small gathering to celebrate his bail was held at the home of his new girlfriend, Michele Robinson, with whom he'd started living the day he got out of Bellevue Hospital the previous October. Ritchie was clean, having been detoxed from heroin during his time at Rikers Island jail. However, at the dinner gathering, his mother had some heroin delivered, against the wishes of his girlfriend. The junkie who delivered it, Peter Kodick, came and went quickly. After Kodick left, Sid overdosed. Robinson revived him, though she had never seen an OD before, nor had any experience in that area. [17] Much later that night, the couple fell asleep together. Vicious was discovered dead late the next morning. An autopsy confirmed that Vicious died from an accumulation of fluid in the lungs that was consistent with heroin overdose. A syringe, spoon and heroin residue were discovered near the body. [18]
