The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model is a neutral and open specification that is not controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors. It is an object oriented file format with a data model developed by the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) to facilitate interoperability in the building industry, and is a commonly used format for Building Information Modeling (BIM). The IFC model specification is open and available.[1] Because of its focus on ease of interoperability between software platforms the Danish government has made the use of IFC format(s) compulsory for publicly aided building projects.[2]

[edit] History
The IFC format was originally developed by the International Alliance for Interoperability established in 1995 by American and European AEC (Architecture Engineering and Construction) firms, along with software vendors, to promote interoperability between software in the Industry. Since 2005, the IFC specification is developed and maintained by buildingSMART International. buildingSMART International is actively facilitating IFC implementation and adaptation via local chapters world-wide.
Graphisoft, a CAD vendor and the developers of ArchiCAD, was the first software company world-wide to allow users to save/export their files in the IFC format.
