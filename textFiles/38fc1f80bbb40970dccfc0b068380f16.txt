ImgBurn is a freeware program that allows the recording of many types of CD/DVD images to recordable media (.cue files are supported as of version 2.4.0.0)[2]. Starting with version 2.0.0.0, ImgBurn can also burn files and data directly to CD/DVD. It supports padding DVD-Video files so the layer break occurs on a proper cell boundary (where possible).

[edit] History
ImgBurn is an optical disc authoring software created by Lightning UK! the author of DVD Decrypter after it was forced to stop development of DVD Decrypter in response to a cease and desist order from Macrovision.[3]
ImgBurn is based on the optical disc burning engine of DVD Decrypter; however, it does not have the ability to circumvent copy protections of encrypted DVDs. As of version 2.3.0.0, ImgBurn can create image files from unencrypted CDs/DVDs. It cannot, however, remove CSS encryption or any other copy protection. It is possible to use third-party software such as DVD43, an intermediate driver that operates between the hardware and software, for such purpose.

[edit] Features

Supported formats: BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, ISO, MDS, NRG, PDI and more.
Ability to build DVD Video discs (from a VIDEO_TS folder), HD DVD Video discs (from a HVDVD_TS folder) and Blu-ray Video discs (from a BDAV / BDMV folder).
Full unicode folder/file name support.
Supported environments: Windows 95, 98, Me, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista and 2008 (including all the 64-bit versions). It also officially supports Wine.
Image queue provides support for burning several images with minimum interaction.
ImgBurn is relatively lightweight (compared to similar programs); under 1.8MB for all installed features.


[edit] Hardware interface support
ImgBurn supports numerous low level drive access interfaces. This allows it to operate on almost all Windows platforms. ImgBurn can use any of the following interfaces:

ASPI - WNASPI32.DLL (Adaptec)
ASAPI - ASAPI.DLL (VOB Computersysteme/Pinnacle Systems)
SCSI Pass Through Interface - Microsoft
ElbyCDIO - Elaborate Bytes
Patin-Couffin - VSO Software
