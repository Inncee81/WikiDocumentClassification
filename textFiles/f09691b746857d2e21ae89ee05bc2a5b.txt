Art Of Illusion

Developed by
Peter Eastman


Latest release
2.7 / 2009-01-26; 80 days ago


Operating system
Cross-platform


Platform
Java


Type
3D computer graphics software


License
GPL


Website
www.artofillusion.org


Art of Illusion is a software package used for 3D modeling, texturing, ray tracing, and otherwise rendering computer generated imagery stills or animations (movies).
The goal of Art of Illusion is to provide powerful 3D modeling tools with a user interface that improves on those found in other 3D software packages. Though its interface is simple, Art of Illusion contains many features found in high-end commercial graphics software. Some of its features, like the use of online repositories and a built-in downloading tool for installing extensions, are not found in similar proprietary software.
The primary creator and maintainer of the software is Peter Eastman.
Art of Illusion is written in the Java programming language. Distributed under the GNU General Public License,[1] it is free software.

[edit] Software Features




"Rain drops are still falling on my antennas" by Jyrki Ihalainen, modeled and rendered using Art of Illusion.



Interface

Object list, scene layout windows, and animation score
Tooltips and explanatory icons
Bundled documentation and help interface
Built-in "live help" chat client for connecting to the freenode Art of Illusion support channel
Extensions available as scripts or plugins with automated installation and update from online repository (requires internet connection)
Grid view and realtime display modes including Wireframe, Smooth, Textured.




Modeling

Primitives: cube, sphere, cone, tube, curve, triangle mesh, spline mesh
Boolean modeling operations
Lathe, sweep, extrude (straight or along a curve)
Subdivision surfaces (smoothing) with edge creasing available for triangle meshes.
Mesh editor featuring adjustable mesh tension, bevel, taper, various selection methods (including select edge loop/strip), etc.
Object array tool (multidimensional arrays or arrays along a curve)
Isosurface modeling (via procedural nodes or direct numeric input)




Animation

Distortion tracks for effects like bend, twist, and shatter
Skeletal animation with weighting, constraints and IK
Poses and Gestures
Keyframe editor with interpolating curves
Path animation
Animation through scripted objects, e.g. particles using Particle Jet script




Textures





Textures created using the Art of Illusion procedural texture editor





Types: Uniform, image mapped, procedural 2D and 3D
Mapping options: Projection, spherical, cylindrical, UV
Per-vertex, per-face and per-face-per-vertex texture assignment (depending on textured object)
Layered textures
Graphical language for procedural texture/material design
Procedural textures can be based on parameters like view angle (for fresnel-like effects), etc.
Animateable textures via texture parameters and use of Time module
Environment background can be mapped with any photo (HDR or RGB), as well as procedural textures


Materials (Represent the internal properties of an object)

Procedural and uniform materials
Adjustable index of refraction, scattering, eccentricity
Animatable materials via Time module

Rendering

Multithreading
Global illumination rendering, along with caustics and subsurface scattering
Global illumination methods: Monte carlo, photon mapping with final gathering, direct photon mapping, and ambient occlusion
Light types: Point lights, spotlights (both with editable radii), and directional lights
Soft shadows
Light scattering for materials: Both Single Scattering and Photon Scattering (BSSRDF). User can specify either or both at rendertime.
Raytraced depth of field
Gloss/translucency (blurred reflections and blurry transparency)
Motion blur
HDRI scene illumination
Save renders as HDRI images




Post Processing

Camera filters (Exposure Correction, Glow, Outline, Tint, Blur, etc.)
Noise reduction for Global Illumination




Scripting

Scripting language (Beanshell) allowing development of new tools/commands
Dynamic Scripts ("smart objects" - see flyswatter tutorial)




File Handling

3D Import: .obj natively; .dem, .dxf, .geo, .lwo, .pov, .inc, .3ds via plugins
2D Import via scripts: .ai, .svg
3D Export: .pov, .obj, VRML, all native; .stl via plugin
2D Export/Save: .jpg, .bmp, .png, .tif, .hdr, all native; .svg via plugin




Extended Functionality Through Scripts and Plugins

Direct-to-disk rendering using presets like "Letter," "A4," with DPI and Bleed settings (Advanced Rendering plugin)
Wireframe/polygon renders with antialiasing and SVG export (Vector Renderer plugin)
Preview renders in sidebar (Preview Plugin)
Subdivision (Ngon) modeler with tools for both open- and closed-mesh modeling and support for Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces (Polymesh Editor plugin)
ABF+ UV unwrapping available through Polymesh Editor plugin
Procedural tree and plant creator (Tree and Plant Designer plugin)
Other major features provided through script or plugin extensions such as: 3D text, mesh thickening, platonic solids, sculpt, fractal/image-based heightfields, hair, grunge, and more




[edit] Development

Art of Illusion is a free and open source application and contributions to the source code, scripts and plugins base, and other aspects of the software are welcome.
Art of Illusion's development cycle usually includes two builds called "Early Access" (EA) releases followed by a Beta, or "bug fix" version. However, with a recent announcement, the bug-fixing portion of development has been shifted to make sure that more bugs are fixed in existing features.
Developers are welcome to submit scripts and plugins via email to maintainers of the Scripts and Plugins Repository for inclusion in the online repository. This ensures that users will be able to download scripts and plugins easily from within Art of Illusion itself.
Developers with code to contribute to AoI itself should submit it to Peter Eastman for approval and inclusion. More information
Non-code contributions can be made as well. Details (Note that the Smartgroups link on that page is obsoleted by the Scripts and Plugins Repository)


[edit] IRTC Competition
The Internet Ray Tracing Competition is an online computer graphics competition. Several Art of Illusion users have submitted entries to the competition.

Nate Ryan's Fungus Dance image won 1st place in the September - October 2003 "Decay" contest. link
Julian MacDonald's "Gladiators" animation won Honorable Mention: Artistic Merit in the July-October 2004 contest. link
"Bathtime Fun", also by Julian MacDonald, won 2nd place in the September-October 2004 contest. link
Kevin Lynn's "Is Juggling a Sport?" animation won 1st place in the July-October 2005 contest. link

Kevin is continuing an Art of Illusion tradition by offering a box of chocolates to the next winner of an online graphics competition using Art of Illusion.




[edit] Press Coverage and Awards
The French Linux magazine Linux Pratique has published articles about Art of Illusion. link (See the French version of this Wikipedia entry for downloadable PDF versions of the articles)
Art of Illusion was the SourceForge.net Project of the Month for April, 2007.
