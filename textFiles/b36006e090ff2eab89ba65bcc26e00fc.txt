New Rave (sometimes labelled Nu Rave or Neu Rave) is a term applied to several types of music that go from fusing elements of electronic, rock, indie[1], to techno[citation needed], hip house, electro[citation needed], breakbeat[citation needed]. In Australia, it is also known as Electrindie[citation needed].
The British music magazine NME is largely responsible for popularising the term throughout 2006 and 2007, despite having claimed in mid-2008 reviews that "New Rave is over". The genre has connotations of being a 'new' version of 'rave' as well as being a corruption of the term 'new wave'.[2]
Klaxons,[3][4][5] Trash Fashion,[6] New Young Pony Club,[7][8][9][10], Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles, Bono Must Die[11] and SHITDISCO[3] are generally accepted as the main exponents of the genre.
The aesthetics of the New Rave scene are largely similar to those of the original rave scene, being mostly centred around psychedelic visual effects. Glowsticks, neon and other lights are common, and followers of the scene often dress in extremely bright and fluorescent colored clothing.[3][12] Indeed, many consider New Rave to be defined more by the image and aesthetic of its bands and supporters, than by the somewhat vague sonic criteria. Trash Fashion lead singer, Jet Storm has been described as the scenes very own pin up. [6][13]. Nevertheless, the usage of electronic instruments, a musical fusion of rock and dance styles, and a particular anarchic, trashy energy are certainly key elements.

[edit] Criticism
The actual sound of original Rave is barely (if at all) discernible (save some typical analog synth lines) in the majority of bands referred to as 'new rave' . Bands such as The Sunshine Underground,[14] Cansei de Ser Sexy, Solo Combo [15], and Hot Chip[16] are often labeled as New Rave due to their large following by fans of the genre, despite evolving in a different musical culture and, in some cases, a different country. M.I.A. has been described as "a new raver before it was old."[17] Several have publicly declared they have nothing to do with the genre. Indeed, even Klaxons have declared they are not New Rave, describing it as a "joke that’s got out of hand."[18] [19][12]
In their review of the Klaxons' new album, Myths of the Near Future, the NME branded all ravers of the traditional rave scene “twats with baggy trousers”. [20]
The New Rave scene can be viewed as a media construct, largely propounded by the NME and TRAX with other publications treating the subject as a joke.[7] The belief that many of the bands associated with New Rave can more appropriately be associated with the genre of dance-punk has given credence to such suggestions, although differences between both genres are said to be minor and more down to aesthetics. John Harris has stated in The Guardian newspaper that the genre is nothing more than a "piss-poor supposed 'youthquake'" that will soon go out of fashion in the same way as rave.[7] In season 3 of the BBC comedy The Mighty Boosh, the song 'Eels' made satirical references to Nu-Rave, in an episode titled Eels.
