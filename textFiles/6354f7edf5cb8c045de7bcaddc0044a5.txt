[edit] History
WebEx was founded in 1995 by Subrah Iyar and Min Zhu. Zhu co-founded Future Labs (one of the first companies to produce multi-point document collaboration software) in 1991.[2] Zhu met Iyar, then a vice president and general manager of Quarterdeck Inc., when Quarterdeck acquired Future Labs in 1996. Iyar was named president of Future Labs, which had been made a Quarterdeck subsidiary, and the same year Iyar and Min went on to co-found WebEx. On March 15, 2007, Cisco Systems announced it would acquire WebEx for $3.2 billion.

[edit] Securities
Before the purchase by Cisco, WebEx previously was included in the NASDAQ Global Select Market.[3]

WebEx acquired the ability to offer online collaboration tools such as discussion forums, document sharing and calendaring while Intranets.com provided access to the WebEx communications environment for its customers.[4]

[edit] Legal proceedings and inquiries

[edit] Goldman Sachs securities fraud investigation
As a result of the securities fraud investigation initiated by the SEC and various state Attorney General offices, Goldman Sachs faced charges of issuing unfair research, including coverage of WebEx, and IPO violations. WebEx management allegedly dictated to Goldman Sachs analysts what the research should and should not include. WebEx maintains the management's information was accurate.[6] Another charge accuses Goldman Sachs of violating securities law in its allocation of shares in WebEx's initial public offering.[7]

[edit] Zhu and Zeleny legal dispute
On May 13, 2005, WebEx announced that Min Zhu was stepping down as CTO and retiring to China, where he would serve as a "WebEx Fellow."[8] This closely followed the WebEx Second Annual Users Conference, which was disrupted and then canceled because of a demonstration by a former business partner of Zhu's, Michael Zeleny.[9] The protest demonstration occurred amid a spate of lawsuits between the Zhu family, WebEx, and Zeleny for various claims, including breach of contract and defamation.[10] In the course of the legal dispute, Zeleny made public online that a complaint for childhood sexual abuse had been made by Zhu's daughter, Zeleny's former domestic and business partner, and alleged that Zhu diverted WebEx assets to settle that complaint. Zhu denied these claims in court records and WebEx sued Zeleny for defamation. Zeleny's claims have since been settled out of court and the WebEx counter-claim dropped.[11]

[edit] Raindance lawsuit for patent infringement
On September 27, 2005, WebEx sued Raindance Communications, Inc., a competitor, for patent infringement. On October 14, 2005, Raindance filed a countersuit against WebEx for patent infringement. Both parties sought both damages and an injunction enjoining further acts they claim to be infringing on patents.[12] On March 31, 2006, the parties agreed to the dismissal of both actions, releases of claims for past infringement, payments associated with those releases, and cross-licenses to each other's patents. The agreement resulted in Webex receiving $1.0 million from Raindance.[12]

[edit] Cisco takeover
On March 15, 2007, Cisco Systems announced that it had agreed a deal to pay $57 per share to acquire WebEx. The deal values WebEx at about $3.2 billion, or $2.9 billion when WebEx's cash reserves are factored into the price. WebEx's largest stockholder is Jan Baan with 9% of outstanding shares. In a press release Cisco said WebEx would "become a part of Cisco's Development Organization while maintaining its unique business model".[13] Cisco has also said that its long-term plan is to absorb WebEx at both a technology and a sales level.[14]
There is also increased use of WebEx as an online learning platform and classroom for a diverse set of education providers. The platform has worked for educational institutions because of real time collaboration using an interactive whiteboard, chat, and VOIP technology that allows audio and video sharing. In distance learning situations, while replacing the classroom with features, institutions have also looked for security features which are inherently strong in a Cisco powered collaboration environment[citation needed]. The downside is that WebEx is not a free platform like WiZiQ or Moodle, and fees are paid per "host" of a classroom or a meeting.
