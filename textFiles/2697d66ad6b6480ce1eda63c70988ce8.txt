[edit] History
Community Server was created in 2004 from the merger of three widely-used open source ASP.NET projects: the .Text blog engine, the nGallery photo gallery, and the ASP.NET Forums.[2] The people behind those projects (Scott Watermasysk, Jason Alexander, and Rob Howard) joined together as Telligent Systems and along with several other developers created Community Server. As of 2007[update] Community Server is the platform behind many large community sites on the internet, including the MySpace forums.[3]
The first annual Community Server Developers Conference was held on October 20-21, 2007 in Frisco, Texas.[4] It was attended by over 100 developers.[5]

[edit] Criticism

The licensing terms for Community Server have changed for the 2007 version. The Personal and Business licenses are no longer available. Only the free express, professional, intranet and enterprise licenses remain, along with a hosted edition. However the free express edition may not be used for commercial use and has limits of 15 Blogs, 15 Forums, 10 Photo Galleries, and 250 Shared Files.[20] The pricing for the 2008 version has doubled in some cases, continuing concerns among users, mostly small businesses, that the software is becoming less affordable.
