[edit] Anomalies
In the book "Tesla: Man Out of Time", there are references to missing patents[7]. Some patents of his experiments are lost to history, as well as some of the scientific notes and records pertaining to Dr. Tesla's patents. These, though, are alluded to in the redacted FBI files. The missing patents may be among effects seized by government agents and military intelligence officers following Dr. Tesla's death in 1943. In various patent logs, it is recorded Tesla received U.S. Patent 613,819 for "Filings Tube" (such as Charles Henry Sewall's "Wireless Telegraphy" (New York, 1904)).[8][9] This number does not match the U. S. Patent office records (that patent is issued to G. Kelly for an "Illuminating torch").
