Amazon Kindle is a software and hardware platform for reading electronic books (e-books), developed by Amazon.com subsidiary Lab126, first launched in the United States on November 19, 2007.[1] Two hardware devices, known as "Kindle" and "Kindle 2," support this platform, as does an iPhone application called "Kindle for iPhone."
The Kindle hardware devices use an electronic paper display and download content over Amazon Whispernet using the Sprint EVDO network. Kindle hardware devices can be used without a computer, and Whispernet is accessible without any fee.[2] These devices also provide free internet access to Wikipedia.[3]
On March 3, 2009, Amazon.com launched an application entitled Kindle for iPhone in the App Store for iPhone and iPod Touch owners to read Kindle content. Through a technology termed "Whispersync," customers can keep their place across Kindle hardware devices and other mobile devices.[4][5]

[edit] Original Kindle




The Kindle


Upon the initial launch of the Kindle, Amazon's Kindle Store had more than 88,000 digital titles available for download, with the number of titles steadily increasing.[6][7] Amazon's first offering of Kindle sold out in five and a half hours[8] and the device remained out of stock until late April 2008.[9]
The Kindle device retailed for $399; Amazon subsequently lowered the price to $359. Amazon does not sell the Kindle outside the United States as Whispernet only works in the U.S.[10] Plans for a launch in the UK and other European countries are being delayed by problems with signing up suitable Wi-Fi operators.[11] The CDMA technology in the Kindle does not allow for its use in the UK due to the lack of a CDMA network operator in the UK.[citation needed]
The internal memory of the Amazon Kindle can hold approximately 200 non-illustrated titles, and the memory is expandable with an SD memory card.[10]
Reviews of Kindle have been generally favorable, although a reviewer from CNET expressed concern with the presentation of the device despite its ergonomic appeal.[12] The picture to the left displays a distinctly beige colored device. In point of fact, both Kindle versions are a matte bright white with all button labels and text colored gray. The Kindle 1 is the exact same color as the Kindle 2 pictured in the upper right-hand corner of this page.

[edit] Kindle 2
On Monday, February 9, 2009, Amazon announced the Kindle 2, which became available for purchase on February 23, 2009 for the price of $359. The new Kindle features improved battery life, 20 percent faster page-refreshing, a text-to-speech option to read the text aloud, [13] and overall thickness reduced from 0.8 to 0.36 inches (9.1 millimetres).[14] The Kindle 2 has 2 GB of internal memory of which 1.4 GB is user-accessible. Amazon estimates that the Kindle 2 will hold about 1500 books. Unlike the original Kindle, Kindle 2 does not have a slot for SD memory cards.[15] To promote the new Kindle, author Stephen King has written a novella called UR, which is available exclusively as a Kindle download.[16]
According to an early review by website iFixIt, the new Kindle 2 features a Freescale 532 MHz, ARM-11 90 nm processor, 2GB moviNAND main memory, and 3.7 V 1530 mAh lithium polymer battery.[17]

[edit] Content
Users can download content from Amazon in the proprietary Kindle format (AZW), or load unprotected Mobipocket (PRC, MOBI) or plain text (TXT) content. Amazon offers an email-based service that will convert HTML, DOC, PDF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP documents to AZW.[18] It also supports audio in the form of MP3s and Audible 2, 3, and 4 audiobooks, which must be transferred to the Kindle over USB, or (on the original Kindle) on an SD card. Kindle Terms of Use forbid transferring e-books to another user or a different type of device.[19]
Users can select reading material through the Kindle or through a computer at the Amazon Kindle store, and can download content through the Kindle Store. New releases and New York Times bestsellers are offered for approximately $10. Classics such as Bleak House sell for around $1.99. The first chapters of many books are offered as a free sample. Many titles, often classics now in the public domain, are offered for free. Subscriptions to newspapers cost between $5.99 and $14.99 per month, magazines between $1.25 and $3.49 per month, and blogs for $0.99-$1.99 per month.[20] Users can send documents to a conversion service which will send a Kindle-formatted file to the device directly for $0.10 or to a personal email account for free.
The device comes with electronic editions of its owner's manual and the New Oxford American Dictionary. The Kindle also contains several free experimental features, including a basic Web browser.[21] Users can also play music from MP3 files in random order in the background. Operating system updates are received over the air and installed automatically.

[edit] File formats
The first Amazon Kindle supports unprotected Mobipocket books (MOBI, PRC), plain text files (TXT), and Amazon's proprietary, DRM-restricted format (AZW). It does not fully support Portable Document Format (PDF), but Amazon provides "experimental" conversion to the native AZW format.[22] Amazon will also convert Microsoft Word files and structured HTML files through the same email based mechanism. Users may also convert PDF files to supported formats using third-party software.
Initially Kindle 1 only supported the ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) character set for its content and unicode characters and non-western characters were not supported. The firmware update of February 2009 supports additional character sets including ISO 8859-16.
Kindle 2 supports the Kindle (AZW), TXT, Audible (formats 4, Audible Enhanced (AAX)), MP3, unprotected MOBI, PRC, PDF, HTML, DOC, JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP (through conversion) formats. Amazon claims that not all PDF's may format correctly.[23]
Using the experimental web browser, it is possible to download books directly on the Kindle (MOBI, PRC, TXT). Hyperlinks in a Mobipocket file can be used to download e-books[24] but cannot be used to reference books stored in the Kindle's memory. The Kindle charges monthly for RSS subscription to select blogs, even though users may use the experimental web browser to navigate to and read blogs or any other web pages free of charge.[25]

[edit] Annotations
The user can bookmark, highlight, and look up content. Pages can be dog-eared for reference and notes can be added to relevant content. While a book is open on the display, menu options allow users to search for synonyms and definitions from the built-in dictionary. The device also remembers the last page read for each book. Pages can be saved as a "clipping", or a text file containing the text of the currently displayed page. All clippings are appended to a single file, which can be downloaded over a USB cable.[26]

[edit] Digital Text Platform




The text can also be displayed in larger sizes


Concurrently with the Kindle device, Amazon launched the Digital Text Platform, a system for authors to self-publish directly to the Kindle. Currently in open beta, the platform was promoted to established authors by e-mail.[27] Authors can upload documents in several formats for delivery via Whispernet and charge between US$0.99 and $200 per download.[27] The authors receive 35% of revenues based on their list price, regardless of discounts by Amazon.[28]

[edit] Criticism
While the reception of the Kindle has generally been favorable, a number of reviews have criticized both the hardware itself, as well as the business model behind it.
One claim is that the price point of the device is too high to be practical in a bad economy[29]--especially given that by design the Kindle is closed to the kind of expansion and customization available to many other consumer electronic devices in the same price range.[30][31]
Critics claim that if the Kindle allowed open development, it could compete with existing music players, video players, cell phones and PDAs to some degree. But as an essentially single function device, locked down from being expanded, and expensive to boot, its potential market is very limited.[32][33] Theoretically, with outside development, other capabilities could be added to the Kindle, which even if they had reduced feature-sets compared to dedicated devices, would vastly expand the desirability of the device.
Additionally there is concern based on the specific hardware choices made for the device.[34] For example, the Kindle 2 had removed the memory expansion slot which was part of the original Kindle. This not only affects the potential number of e-books which can be stored on the device, it also removes potential capabilities to import e-books onto the device via memory card. Another hardware decision which has been questioned is the non-availability of WiFi functionality on the Kindle. Instead the device relies on Sprint's Whispernet service[35], which, critics argue does provide a large amount of geographical coverage, but also drives the price of the device up considerably.[36] It also limits the device's functionality outside the US.
Other criticisms which have been raised involve not only the hardware, but the economic/business model behind Amazon's entire implementation and distribution of e-books.[37][38] While the cost of e-books has dropped somewhat, the true potential savings to consumers has not been realized. E-books are theoretically far cheaper to produce than printed books, especially when marketed in large volume, but many of Amazon's policies for marketing their e-books have severely limited the potential volume of e-book sales they'd need to sell to reduce costs further, and thus allowing lower pricing, which would allow Amazon to sell at yet even greater volume. The biggest of these barriers, until recently, has been that Kindle format books could only be read on a Kindle device, this limiting book purchasing to Kindle owners. Since it is an expensive device, the potential to sell large quantities of e-books on Amazon.com was severely limited. Amazon, however, eventually retreated from their "Kindle device only" policy and recently introduced a software application allowing Kindle books to be read on an iPhone (or iPod Touch).[39]

[edit] Discovery lawsuit
On March 17, 2009, Discovery Communications filed a lawsuit seeking unspecified damaged, royalties and legal fees against Amazon.com in Delaware alleging infringement of patents on security developed by John Hendricks in the 1990s.[40]
