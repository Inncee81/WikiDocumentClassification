HR-XML is a library of XML schemas developed by the HR-XML Consortium, Inc. to support a variety of business processes related to human resource management. It includes schemas to represent résumés, payroll information, benefits enrollment, and so on.
The HR-XML Consortium is an independent, non-profit consortium that develops freely available interoperability specifications for human resources management. The focus of its work is the development of specifications for electronic exchange between arms-length HR service providers.
The HR-XML Consortium was incorporated in California in 1999. It is classified under the U.S. tax code as a non-profit, 501(c)(6) business league.

[edit] Members
The HR-XML Consortium is a membership organization. Memberships are available for individuals and organizations. Most organizational members are HR services providers that have the need to interact with arms-length trading partners in conducting their business. HR-XML's current members include the world's largest software companies and leading companies in the HR services industry.

[edit] Scope of Work
Human resources spans a diverse number of business processes. The HR-XML Consortium has developed a broad range of specifications designed to enable e-business between arms-length HR service providers. Among the types of interactions supported by HR-XML Consortium specifications are:

Assessments
Background checks and pre-employment screening
Benefits enrollment
Employee performance management
Import of new hire information
Metrics interchange
Post-payroll reports of benefit contributions
Pre-payroll instructions for adjustments and deductions
Provisioning of payroll and benefit outsourcing systems
Employee Stock plans
Temporary and contingent staffing
The communication of position openings
The communication of resumes, CVs, and candidate profiles
Time worked and expense reporting

A full set of documentation and standalone and modular schemas can be downloaded at no cost by registering at the HR-XML website.

[edit] Use Examples
Below are a few examples of uses HR-XML specifications are designed to fill:

Assessments: An Internet-based recruiting solution may want to provide its clients a way to order testing or assessments from a third-party test publisher or assessment firm. HR-XML provides a set of XML schemas defining messages such companies might use for order creation and fulfillment.
Staffing: An employer may use a staffing management or vendor management system (VMS) to place requisitions for temporary help with staffing suppliers. HR-XML's "Staffing Industry Data Exchange Standards" (SIDES) define a set of messages to manage the interactions between the VMS and the staffing supplier system throughout the requisition process.
Employee benefits: An employer may use a benefits services outsourcing company as its record keeper for employee benefit programs. That outsourcing company may use HR-XML's enrollment and indicative data specifications to keep related benefit plan partners (for example, insurance companies) up-to-date with current employee benefit elections and status changes (for example, name changes, termination of employment, adoption of a dependent, designation of beneficiaries, etc.).


[edit] Adoption of HR-XML Specifications
There is documented adoption of HR-XML by companies in many regions of the World. Localized content or adaptations have been provided within the HR-XML library for market requirements within France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, and the United States.

[edit] Certification
One measure of adoption has been the growing number of service providers who have been awarded HR-XML certification.
HR-XML capabilities or conformance also are claimed in the communications of many companies who have not been awarded certification.

[edit] Case Studies
Adoption also is evidenced by case studies published by the HR-XML Consortium.
