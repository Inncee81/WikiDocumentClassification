Guerrilla marketing is an unconventional system of promotions that relies on time, energy and imagination rather than a big marketing budget. Typically, guerrilla marketing tactics are unexpected and unconventional; consumers are targeted in unexpected places, which can make the idea that's being marketed memorable, generate buzz, and even spread virally. The term was coined and defined by Jay Conrad Levinson in his 1983 book Guerrilla Marketing. The term has since entered the popular vocabulary and marketing textbooks.
Guerilla Marketing involves unusual approaches such as intercept encounters in public places, street giveaways of products, pr stunts, any unconventional marketing intended to get maximum results from minimal resources. More innovative approaches to Guerilla marketing now utilize cutting edge mobile digital technologies to really engage the consumer and create a memorable brand experience. Great examples of this type of marketing include products such as T-Shirt TV T-shirttv.com, the mobile media chariot or video segway, and ice cream truck advertising, created by Guerrilla Marketing companies like Brand Marketers Brand Marketers

[edit] Introduction
Levinson's books include hundreds of "guerrilla marketing weapons," but they also encourage guerrilla marketeers to be creative and devise their own unconventional methods of promotion. A guerrilla marketeer uses all of his or her contacts, both professional and personal, and examines his company and its products, looking for sources of publicity. Many forms of publicity can be very inexpensive, others are free.
Levinson says that when implementing guerrilla marketing tactics, small size is actually an advantage instead of a disadvantage. Small organizations and entrepreneurs are able to obtain publicity more easily than large companies as they are closer to their customers and considerably more agile.
Yet ultimately, according to Levinson, the Guerrilla Marketeer must "deliver the goods". In The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook, he states: "In order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the customer. It must build trust and support. It must understand the customer's needs, and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefits."
Levinson identifies the following principles as the foundation of guerrilla marketing:

Guerrilla Marketing is specifically geared for the small business and entrepreneur.
It should be based on human psychology instead of experience, judgment, and guesswork.
Instead of money, the primary investments of marketing should be time, energy, and imagination.
The primary statistic to measure your business is the amount of profits, not sales.
The marketer should also concentrate on how many new relationships are made each month.
Create a standard of excellence with an acute focus instead of trying to diversify by offering too many diverse products and services.
Instead of concentrating on getting new customers, aim for more referrals, more transactions with existing customers, and larger transactions.
Forget about the competition and concentrate more on cooperating with other businesses.
Guerrilla Marketers should always use a combination of marketing methods for a campaign.
Use current technology as a tool to empower your business.


[edit] Associated marketing trends
The term Guerrilla Marketing is now often used more loosely as a descriptor for non-traditional media, such as:

Viral marketing -- through social networks
Ambient marketing
Presence marketing
Grassroots marketing
Wild Posting Campaigns
Alternative marketing
Buzz marketing -- word of mouth marketing
Undercover marketing -- subtle product placement
Astroturfing -- releasing company news to imitate grassroots popularity
Experiential marketing -- interaction with product
Tissue-pack marketing

Guerrilla marketing was initially used by small and medium size (SMEs) businesses, but it is now increasingly adopted by large businesses. Excessive use and abuse, expecially from great companies, generated a progressive loss of effectiveness. In some cases the result has been opposite to that one hoped.[citation needed]

[edit] Controversy

[edit] Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Main article: 2007 Boston Mooninite Scare
On 31 January 2007, several magnetic light displays in and around the city of Boston, Massachusetts, were mistaken for possible explosive devices. Several subway stations, bridges, and a portion of Interstate 93 were closed as police examined, removed, and in some cases, destroyed the devices. The suspicious objects were revealed to be ads depicting the Mooninites, Ignignokt and Err, characters from the Cartoon Network's latenight Adult Swim animated television series Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

[edit] Messages On Hold
In December 2007, a staff member of on hold advertising company, took a life-size placard of cricket legend Shane Warne wearing a branded t-shirt and the company’s tell-tale ‘giant hand’ outside the West Australian Cricket Ground at the 3rd Ashes Test. The act of ambush marketing was noticed and the staff member issued a fine for ‘displaying a sign without a permit’, sparking a nationwide debate over wearing clothing with brand names.[1]
