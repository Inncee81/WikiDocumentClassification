Cahokia kəhoʊkiːə is the site of an ancient Native American city (650-1400 CE) near Collinsville, Illinois in the American Bottom floodplain, across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri. The 2,200-acre (8.9 km2) site includes at least 109 man-made earthen mounds. Cahokia Mounds is the largest archaeological site related to the Mississippian culture, which developed advanced societies in eastern North America centuries before the arrival of Europeans.[1] It is a designated site for state protection, a National Historic Landmark, and a World Heritage Site.

Cahokia Mounds was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.[2]Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site was designated a World Heritage Site in 1982. The park protects 2200 acres (8.9 km²), and is the focus of ongoing archaeological research. This is one of only eight cultural World Heritage Sites in the United States as designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).[3]

[edit] History
Cahokia was settled around 650 CE during the Late Woodland period. Mound building did not begin until about 1050 CE, at the start of the Mississippian cultural period. The inhabitants left no records beyond the symbols that appear on pottery, shell, copper, wood, and stone.[4]. The city's original name is unknown.
The name "Cahokia" originally referred to an unrelated clan of Illiniwek people living in the area when the first French explorers arrived in the 1600s, long after the Cahokia site was abandoned. The descendants of the people who constructed the mounds centuries earlier are unknown, although many different Native American groups have been suggested.

[edit] Monk's Mound
Monk's Mound is the central focus of this great ceremonial center. A massive structure with four terraces, it is the largest man-made earthen mound in North America. Facing south, it is 92 feet (28 m) high, 951 feet (290 m) long and 836 feet (255 m) wide [5]. The Travel Channel has called it the "world's largest pyramid."
Excavation on the top of Monk's Mound has revealed evidence of a large building — perhaps a temple or the residence of the paramount chief — that could be seen throughout the city. This building was about 105 feet (32 m) long and 48 feet (15 m) wide, and could have been as much as 50 feet (15 m) high.
The east and northwest sides of Monk's Mound were twice excavated in August 2007 in conjunction with efforts to prevent erosion.[6]

[edit] Woodhenge

Woodhenge, a circle of posts used to make astronomical sightings, stood to the west of Monk's Mound. Archaeologists discovered Woodhenge during excavation of the site and noted that the placement of posts marked solstices and equinoxes, like its namesake, Stonehenge.[7][8] Detailed analytical work supports the hypothesis that the placement of these posts was by design.[9] The structure was rebuilt several times during the urban center's roughly 300-year history.
According to Chappell, "A beaker[10] found in a pit near the winter solstice post bore a circle and cross symbol that for many Native Americans symbolizes the Earth and the four cardinal directions. Radiating lines probably symbolized the sun, as they have in countless other civilizations."[11] Cahokia's Woodhenge is not to be confused with another site of the same name that exists in the United Kingdom.

[edit] Urban landscape
A 19-hectare (190,000 m²) plaza spreads out to the south of Monk's Mound. Researchers originally thought the flat, open terrain in this area reflected Cahokia's location on the Mississippi's alluvial flood plain. Soil studies showed that the landscape was originally undulating and had been expertly leveled by the city's inhabitants. The Grand Plaza of Cahokia measured 40 acres (16 ha). Along with the Grand Plaza to the south, three other very large plazas surround Monks Mound to the east, west, and north.
A wooden stockade with a series of watchtowers at regular intervals formed a two-mile (3 km)-long enclosure around Monk's Mound and the Grand Plaza. Archaeologists found evidence of the stockade during excavation of the area and indications that it was rebuilt several times. The stockade separated Cahokia's main ceremonial precinct from the outlying sections of the city.
Beyond Monk's Mound, as many as 120 more mounds stood at varying distances from the city center. To date, 109 mounds have been located, 68 of which are in the park area. The mounds are divided into several different types — platform, conical, ridge-top, etc. — each of which may have had its own meaning and function. In general terms, the city center seems to have been laid out in a diamond-shaped pattern approximately a mile (1.6 km) from end to end, while the entire city is five miles (8 km) across from east to west.

[edit] Ancient city
Cahokia was the most important center for the peoples known today as Mississippians. Their settlements ranged across what is now the Midwest, Eastern, and Southeastern United States. Cahokia maintained trade links with communities as far away as the Great Lakes to the north and the Gulf Coast to the south. Pottery and stone tools in the Cahokian style were found at the Silvernale site near Red Wing, Minnesota.
At the high point of its development, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great Mesoamerican cities in Mexico. Although it was home to only about 1,000 people before ca. 1050, its population grew explosively after that date. Archaeologists estimate the city's population at between 8,000 and 40,000 at its peak, with more people living in outlying farming villages that supplied the main urban center.
If the highest population estimates are correct, Cahokia was larger than any city that emerged in the United States until about 1800, when Philadelphia's population grew beyond 40,000.

[edit] Prestige burial

During excavation of Mound 72, a ridge-top burial mound south of Monk's Mound, archaeologists found the remains of a man in his 40s who was probably an important Cahokian ruler. The man was buried on a bed of more than twenty thousand marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a falcon, with the bird's head appearing beneath the man's head and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs. The falcon warrior or "birdman" is a common motif in Mississippian culture. This burial clearly had powerful iconographic significance. A cache of arrowheads in a variety of different styles and materials was found near the grave of this important man. Separated into four types, each from a different geographical region, the arrowheads demonstrated Cahokia's extensive trade links in North America.
Over 250 other skeletons were also recovered from Mound 72. Four young male skeletons were missing their hands. Nearby was a mass grave of over 50 women all about 21 years old at death. Their bodies were arranged in two layers separated by matting. Researchers believe that all these individuals were human sacrifices. Another mass burial in Mound 72 contained 40 men and women who appear to have been suffered violent deaths. It has been suggested that some of these individuals were buried alive: "From the vertical position of some of the fingers, which appear to have been digging in the sand, it is apparent that not all of the victims were dead when they were interred - that some had been trying to pull themselves out of the mass of bodies.". (Young & Fowler 2000:146-149). The relationship of these peripheral burials to the central burial is unclear. It is unlikely, though, that the various burial groups were all deposited at the time. Wood in differrent parts of the mound has been radiocarbon-dated to between 950 and 1000 C.E.

[edit] Cahokia's decline
Cahokia was abandoned a century or more before Europeans arrived in North America in the early 1500s. Scholars have proposed environmental factors such as over-hunting and deforestation as explanations. Another possible cause is invasion by outside peoples, though the only evidence of warfare found so far is the wooden stockade and watchtowers that enclosed Cahokia's main ceremonial precinct. The lack of direct evidence for warfare, however, suggests that the palisade functioned more for ritual than military purposes. Diseases transmitted among the large, dense urban population are another possible cause of decline. The most recent theories propose political collapse associated with military failure as the primary reason for Cahokia’s abandonment.[12]
