TestDisk is a free data recovery utility. It was primarily designed to help recover lost data storage partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally erasing a partition table).

[edit] Summary
TestDisk queries the BIOS or the operating system in order to find the hard disks and their characteristics (LBA size and CHS geometry). TestDisk does a quick check of your disk's structure and compares it with the partition table for entry errors. If the table has entry errors, TestDisk can repair them.
However, it's up to the user to look over the list of possible partitions found by TestDisk and to select the one(s) which were being used just before the drive failed to boot or the partition(s) were lost. In some cases, especially after initiating a detailed search for lost partitions, TestDisk may show partition data which is simply from the remnants of a partition that had been deleted and overwritten long ago.
TestDisk has features for both novices [1] and experts [2]:

Recover deleted partition
Rebuild partition table
Rewrite Master boot record (MBR)
File Allocation Table, FAT [3]

FAT12 and FAT16

Find filesystem parameters to rewrite a valid boot sector
Use the two copies of the FAT to rewrite a coherent version
FAT file undelete [4]


FAT32

Find filesystem parameters to rewrite a valid boot sector
Restore the boot sector using its backup
Use the two copies of the FAT to rewrite a coherent version
FAT file undelete [4]




NTFS [5]

Find filesystem parameters to rewrite a valid boot sector
Restore the boot sector using its backup
Restore the Master File Table (MFT) from its backup
NTFS file undelete [6]


Extended file systems, ext2 and ext3

Find backup superblock location to assist fsck [7]
ext2 file undelete [8]


HFS+

Restore the boot sector using its backup



For those who know little or nothing about data recovery techniques, TestDisk can be used to collect detailed information about a corrupted drive which can then be sent to a tech for further analysis.

Recovery Is Possible
Knoppix STD
GParted Live CD
Iloog
PLD Live CD and PLD RescueCD, based on PLD Linux Distribution.
Slax-LFI, a SLAX derivated distribution
SystemRescueCD
Trinity Rescue Kit
Ubuntu Rescue Remix, the Ubuntu derivation
Ultimate Boot CD - Linux/freeDOS-based computer rescue CD (partition, filesystem, and Windows tools).

They are also packaged for numerous Linux distribution
