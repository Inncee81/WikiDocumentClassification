This is a list of some vector calculus formulae of general use in working with various coordinate systems.

[edit] Note

This page uses standard physics notation. For spherical coordinates, θ is the angle between the z axis and the radius vector connecting the origin to the point in question. φ is the angle between the projection of the radius vector onto the x-y plane and the x axis. Some (American mathematics) sources reverse this definition.
The function atan2(y, x) is used instead of the mathematical function arctan(y/x) due to its domain and image. The classical arctan(y/x) has an image of (-π/2, +π/2), whereas atan2(y, x) is defined to have an image of (-π, π]. (The expressions for the Nabla in spherical coordinates may need to be corrected)
