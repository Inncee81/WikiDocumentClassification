In computing, Synergy is a software application for sharing a keyboard and mouse between multiple computers. It is used in situations where several PCs are used together, with a monitor connected to each, but are to be controlled by one user. The user needs only one keyboard and mouse on the desk — similar to a KVM switch without the Video.
Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Synergy is free software.

[edit] Design
Once the program is installed, users can move the mouse "off" the side of their desktop on one computer, and the mouse-pointer will appear on the desktop of another computer. Key presses will be delivered to whichever computer the mouse-pointer is located in. This makes it possible to control several machines as easily as if they were a single multi-monitor computer.
Synergy is able to integrate Unix, Linux, Macintosh and Windows machines, even down to the clipboard and synchronization of screensavers.
Architecturally, the program is implemented as a server which defines which screen-edges lead to which machines, and one or more clients, which connect to the server to offer the use of their desktops. The keyboard and mouse are connected to the server machine.

[edit] Network communications
TCP/IP communications (on port 24800) are used to send mouse/keyboard and clipboard events between computers. Communications are not encrypted, and key presses, mouse movements, and clipboard contents sent to Synergy clients can be easily sniffed on network traffic.
It is recommended that if Synergy is not being used on a trusted local network, that all communications be tunneled through a secure encrypted connection, such as through SSH, or a VPN. In this model, the Synergy server computer needs to be running an SSH server, and the Synergy process should be configured to listen only on localhost. To get an SSH server, Macintosh users can enable Remote Access, Linux users can enable sshd, and Windows users can configure an SSH server through Cygwin. Synergy clients would then execute a command similar to "ssh -L 24800:localhost:24800 user@synergyserver" before connecting the synergy client to localhost.
