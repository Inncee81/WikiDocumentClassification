The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time was the cover story of a special issue of Rolling Stone magazine published in November 2004,[1] a year after the magazine published its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The song list was chosen based on votes by 172 musicians, critics, and music industry figures.

[edit] Statistics
The list is largely composed of American and British artists: out of the 500 songs, 357 are from the United States and 117 from the United Kingdom; the third most represented country is Ireland with 12 entries, then Canada with 10.
The list includes just one song not in English -"La Bamba" by Ritchie Valens (#345)-, only three songs from the 21st century -"Lose Yourself" by Eminem (#166), "Stan" by Eminem (#290), and "Hey Ya!" by OutKast (#180)-, and just two songs from the 1940s -"Rollin' Stone" by Muddy Waters and Hank Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" (#111)-.
With 23 songs on the list, The Beatles are the most represented musical act. John Lennon is the only artist to place multiple songs in the top 10 (as a member of the Beatles and as a solo artist). The Beatles are followed by The Rolling Stones (14 entries); Bob Dylan (12); Elvis Presley (11); The Beach Boys and Jimi Hendrix (seven each); and Chuck Berry, U2, James Brown, Prince, Led Zeppelin and Sly & the Family Stone (six each).
