Charles John "Chuck" Klosterman (born June 5, 1972, in Breckenridge, Minnesota) is an American journalist whose work often focuses on pop culture. He was raised on a farm near Wyndmere, North Dakota and graduated from the University of North Dakota in 1994. After college he was a journalist in Fargo, North Dakota and later an arts critic for the Akron Beacon Journal in Akron, Ohio, before moving to New York City in 2002.




Klosterman


Klosterman was a senior writer for Spin and had a column titled "My Back Pages," formerly "Rant and Roll Over" and "### Words from Chuck Klosterman." In March 2006, it was reported that Klosterman was fired after the magazine was sold and editor-in-chief Sia Michel was replaced, along with many other staffers. He still regularly contributes as a featured columnist to Esquire and has written for GQ, The New York Times Magazine, The Believer, and The Washington Post.
Klosterman participated in an e-mail exchange on ESPN's Page 2 with writer Bill Simmons in August 2004. In September 2005, Simmons interviewed him in his "Curious Guy" segment. Though initially recognized for his rock writing, Klosterman has written extensively about sports and began contributing articles to Page2 on November 8, 2005. The ESPN site featured his week-long blog from Super Bowl XL in February 2006, as well as a weekend-long blog covering his experience at the NCAA basketball Final Four in 2007.
As of 2008[update], Klosterman is the Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the University of Leipzig's Institute for American Studies in Leipzig, Germany.
