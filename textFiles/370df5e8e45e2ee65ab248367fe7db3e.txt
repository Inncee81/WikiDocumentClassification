ActiveX is a framework for defining reusable software components (known as controls) that perform a particular function or a set of functions in a way that is independent of the programming language used to implement them. A software application can then be composed from one or more of these components in order to provide its functionality.[1]
It was introduced in 1996 by Microsoft Corporation as a development of its Component Object Model (COM) and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) technologies and it is commonly used in its Windows operating system, although the technology itself is not tied to it.
Many Microsoft Windows applications — including many of those from Microsoft Corporation itself, such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Studio, Windows Media Player, etc. — use ActiveX controls to build their feature-set and also encapsulate their own functionality as ActiveX controls which can then be embedded into other applications. Internet Explorer also allows embedding ActiveX controls onto web pages.

[edit] ActiveX controls




An ActiveX control being created in Visual Basic 6


ActiveX controls — small program building blocks — can serve to create distributed applications that work over the Internet through web browsers. Examples include customized applications for gathering data, viewing certain kinds of files, and displaying animation.
One can compare ActiveX controls in some sense to Java applets: programmers designed both these mechanisms so that web browsers could download and execute them. However, they also differ:

Java applets can run on nearly any platform, while ActiveX components officially operate only with Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser and the Microsoft Windows operating system.[2]
Programmers can grant to ActiveX controls a much higher level of control over Windows than Java applets ever achieve, making them both more powerful and dangerous. Malware, such as computer viruses and spyware, often spreads as ActiveX controls in webpages.

Programmers can write ActiveX controls in any of the following languages/environments:

MFC
ATL
C++
C#
Borland Delphi
Visual Basic

Common examples of ActiveX controls include command buttons, list boxes, dialog boxes, and the Internet Explorer browser.

[edit] History
Faced with the complexity of OLE 2.0 and with poor support for COM in MFC, Microsoft rationalized the specifications to make them simpler, and rebranded the technology as ActiveX in 1996.[3][4] Even after simplification, users still required controls to implement about six core interfaces. In response to this complexity, Microsoft produced wizards, ATL base classes, macros and C++ language extensions to make it simpler to write controls.
Starting with Internet Explorer 3.0 (1996), Microsoft added support to host ActiveX controls within HTML content. If the browser encountered a page specifying an ActiveX control via an OBJECT tag, it would automatically download and install the control with little or no user intervention. This made the web "richer" but provoked objections (since such controls only ran on Windows) and security risks (especially given the lack of user intervention). Microsoft subsequently introduced security measures to make browsing including ActiveX safer. For example:

digital signing of installation packages (Cabinet files and executables)
controls must explicitly declare themselves safe for scripting
increasingly more stringent default security settings
Internet Explorer maintains a blacklist of bad controls


[edit] Other ActiveX technologies
Microsoft has developed a large number of products and software platforms using ActiveX objects, and[weasel words]many remain in use as of 2009:

ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)
Active Server Pages
ActiveMovie, later renamed to DirectShow
Active Messaging, later renamed to Collaboration Data Objects
Active Scripting, a technology for scripting ActiveX objects
ActiveX Streaming Format (ASF), renamed to Advanced Streaming Format, then to Advanced Systems Format


[edit] Active technologies
In the late 1990s Microsoft began to reuse the term "Active" in a large number of its technologies. The following technologies do not relate to ActiveX itself, but have similar naming:

Active Channel
Active Desktop
Active Directory
