Non-English-based programming languages are computer programming languages that, unlike most well-known programming languages, do not use keywords taken from, or inspired by, the English vocabulary.

[edit] Prevalence of English-based programming languages
Further information: English in computing
There has been an overwhelming trend in programming languages to use the English language to inspire the choice of keywords and code libraries. According to the HOPL online database of languages,[1] out of the 8500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2400 of them were developed in the United States, 600 in the United Kingdom, 160 in Canada, 75 in Australia.
Another way to say it is that almost half of all programming languages were developed in an English-speaking country. This does not take into account how widely used each language is, nor situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of Python from the Netherlands) or because it was based on another language which used English (see the case of Caml, developed in France but using English keywords).

[edit] Based on non-English languages

Aheui – An esoteric programming language similar to Befunge but using Hangul (Korean)
AMMORIA – Open source object oriented Arabic programming language, designed especially for Arabs.
Analitik – a Russian-based language for symbolic manipulations with algebraic expressions used in the Soviet series of Mir computers
ARLOGO – The first open-source Arabic programming language, based on the UCB Logo interpreter
Chinese BASIC – Chinese-localized BASIC dialects based on Applesoft BASIC; for Taiwanese Apple II clones and the Multitech Microprofessor II
எழில், Ezhil programming language – A Tamil programming language developed for educational purposes.[1]
Farsi.NET - A Persian (Farsi, فارسی, پارسی) OO programming language for .NET Framework. It's similar to C# and Delphi.
Fjölnir – An Icelandic imperative programming language of the 1980s
FOCAL – Keywords were originally English, but DEC produced versions of FOCAL in several European languages
4th Dimension – On local versions, its internal language uses French or German keywords
Jeem – Arabic programming language, based on C++ with simple graphics implementation
Glagol – A Russian-based programming language similar to Oberon and Pascal
GOTO++ – A French esoteric programming language loosely based on French and English
Hindawi Programming System – Indian language set of equivalents for C, C++, lex, yacc, assembly, BASIC, logo, Ada and others for languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, Assamese, and Bangla (with the BangaBhasha version)
Hindi Programming Language – A Hindi language programming language for the .NET Framework
hForth – A Forth system with an optional Korean keyword set
HPL – Hebrew Programming Language
Lexico – A Spanish OO language for teaching .NET programming
Linotte – A French programming Language
Logo – In one of its Apple II editions was available in French.
Loughaty – A general-purpose natural Arabic programming language based on a proprietary syntax.
LSE – Langage Symbolique d'Enseignement, a French, pedagogical, programming language designed in the 1970s at the École Supérieure d'Électricité. A kind of BASIC, but with procedures, functions, local variables, like in Pascal.
MS Word and MS Excel – Their macro languages used to be localized in non-English languages
ML4 - a language for client/server database programming, with keywords in English or German [2]
Rapira – A Russian-based interpreted procedural programming language with strong dynamic type system
Robik – A simple Russian-based programming language for teaching basics of programming to children
SAKO – A language created in the 1950s and nicknamed the "Polish FORTRAN"
Superlogo – A Dutch creation for computer-aided instruction, based on Logo
TI-Calculator BASIC – The 68000 version is localized. Unfortunately, various configuration strings are localized too, preventing direct binary compatibility.
var'aq – A language based on the constructed Klingon language of Star Trek
W-Language - French Programming language used in the WinDev CASE Tool.
Jeem ج - Arabic Programming Language developed by Dr M A Al-Salka Jeem Website.


[edit] Languages based on symbols instead of keywords
Many of them are esoteric programming languages.

APL – A language based on mathematical notation and abstractions
Brainfuck – A minimalist esoteric programming language, created for the purpose of having a compiler fit in fewer than 256 bytes. Its predecessor P′′, used to prove assertions about structured programming languages, also used symbols.
FALSE – A stack-based minimalist esoteric programming language with syntax consisting mainly of single non-alphanumeric characters
Piet – An art-based programming language
Plankalkül – An early language developed by German computer pioneer Konrad Zuse; using a symbolic tabular notation
Velato – A language whose commands are determined by the sequence of notes in a MIDI file
Whitespace – A language based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks).


[edit] Modifiable parser syntax

ChinesePython – A complete translation of the Python scripting language into Chinese
HyperTalk – The programming language used in Apple's HyperCard; allows translation via custom resources
Macintosh AppleScript – once allowed for different "dialects" including French and Japanese; however, these were removed in later versions
Perl – While Perl's keywords and function names are generally in English, it allows modification of its parser to modify the input language, such as in Damian Conway's Lingua::Romana::Perligata module which allows programs to be written in Latin.
Protium – a language designed to support any possible human language
Maude - Completely user definable syntax and semantics, within the bounds of the ASCII character set [2]
