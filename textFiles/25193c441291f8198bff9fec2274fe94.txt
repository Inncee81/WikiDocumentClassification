[edit] Plot introduction
T. H. White uses The Once and Future King as his own personal view of the ideal society. The book, most of which "takes place on the isle of Gramarye," chronicles the raising and education of King Arthur, his rule as a king, and the romance between his best knight Sir Lancelot and his Queen Guinevere (which he spells Guenever). It ends immediately before Arthur's final battle against his illegitimate son Mordred. Though White admits his book's source material is loosely derived from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (The Death of Arthur), he creates a personal reinterpretation of the epic events, filling them with renewed meaning for a world enduring the Second World War.
The book is divided into 4 parts:

The Sword in the Stone (1938)
The Queen of Air and Darkness (1939) (published separately in somewhat different form as The Witch in the Wood)
The Ill-Made Knight (1940)
The Candle in the Wind (First published in the composite edition, 1958)

A final part called The Book of Merlyn was published separately (ISBN 0-292-70769-X) following White's death. It chronicles Arthur's final lessons from Merlyn before his death, although some parts of it were incorporated into the final editions of the previous books.
An often quoted passage from the book is the story that the badger calls his "dissertation," a retelling of the Creation story from Genesis.

[edit] Plot summary
The story starts in the last years of the rule of king Uther Pendragon. The Sword in the Stone chronicles Arthur's raising by his foster father Sir Ector, his rivalry and friendship with his foster brother Kay, and his initial training by Merlyn, a wizard who lives through time backwards. Merlyn, knowing the boy's destiny, teaches Arthur (known as "Wart") what it means to be a good king by turning him into various kinds of animals: fish, hawk, ant, owl, goose, and badger. Each of the transformations is meant to teach Wart a lesson, which will prepare him for his future life.
In fact, Merlyn instills in Arthur the concept that the only justifiable reason for war is to prevent another from going to war then, and that contemporary human governments and powerful people exemplify the worst aspects of the rule of Might.
In The Queen of Air and Darkness, White sets the stage for Arthur's demise by introducing the Orkney clan and detailing Arthur's seduction by their mother, his half-sister Morgause. While the young king suppresses initial rebellions, Merlyn leads him to envision a means of harnessing potentially destructive Might for the cause of Right: the Round Table.
The third part, The Ill-Made Knight, shifts focus from King Arthur to the story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guenever's forbidden love, the means they go through to hide their affair from the King, and its effect on Elaine, Lancelot's wife and the mother of his son Galahad.
The Candle in the Wind unites these narrative threads by telling how Mordred's hatred of his father and Agravaine's hatred of Sir Lancelot caused the eventual downfall of King Arthur, Queen Guenever, Sir Lancelot, and the entire ideal kingdom of Camelot.
The book begins as a quite light-hearted account of the young Arthur's adventures, Merlyn's incompetence at magic, and King Pellinore's interminable search for the Questing Beast. Parts of The Sword in the Stone read almost as a parody of the traditional Arthurian legend by virtue of White's prose style, which relies heavily on anachronisms. However, the tale gradually becomes darker until Ill-Made Knight loses much of the original humor and The Candle in the Wind is mirthless.

[edit] Characterization in the work
Perhaps most striking about White's work is how he reinterprets the traditional Arthurian characters, often giving them motivations or traits more complex or even contradictory to those in earlier versions of the legend. For example:

Arthur is a well-intentioned king as trained by Merlyn, but it seems that his greatest flaw is his inability to adapt once Merlyn leaves him: he comes off as well-meaning yet rather ineffectual
Lancelot is no longer the handsome knight typical in the romantic legends but is instead portrayed as the ugliest of that lot. He is also a sadist, a trait he represses, but which leads to bouts of self-loathing. He seeks to overcome his flaws through full devotion towards becoming Arthur's greatest knight
Merlyn lives through time backwards, making him a bumbling yet wise old man who is getting younger

It is also interesting to note that White allows Thomas Malory to have a cameo appearance towards the end of the final book. Also of note is White's treatment of historical characters and kings as mythological within this world that he creates. In addition, due to his living backwards, Merlyn makes many anachronistic allusions to events in more recent times; of note are references to the Second World War, telegraphs, tanks, and "an Austrian who … plunged the civilized world into misery and chaos" (i.e. Hitler).

[edit] Film, television and theatrical adaptations
Although they initially purchased the film rights to The Ill-Made Knight in 1944[1], when Walt Disney eventually produced an adaptation it was of The Sword in the Stone, released in 1963. This movie reflects more the sense of humour of Disney's team of animators than White. The movie adds a more comical side to the original story, including song and dance, as in most Walt Disney films. Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's 1960 musical Camelot (which was made into a movie in 1967) is based mostly on the last two books of The Once and Future King, and features White's idea of having Thomas Malory make a cameo appearance at the end, again as "Tom of Warwick".

[edit] Allusions and references to The Once and Future King





Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or articles. (June 2008)



The words "The once and future king" were found written on a wall in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel where Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated.
The X-Men comics mention The Once & Future King several times, notably in the first issue of "The X-Tinction Agenda" story arc, which mentions that The Once & Future King is Professor Charles Xavier's favorite book, and that Xavier always saw himself as Merlyn, the teacher guiding the hero(es), rather than as a hero himself. In the Ultimate X-Men comics, the book is a metaphor for Magneto, an extremely powerful mutant terrorist.


The film X2 begins with the main antagonist, Magneto, reading an old copy of The Once & Future King in his prison cell. When Magneto saves the X-men's plane from crashing, he asks Mystique, "When will these people learn to fly?", a reference to The Once & Future King's recurring theme that men wouldn't fight wars if they could fly. At the end of the film, Xavier is using the book as a teaching tool.


Austrian death metal band Cadaverous Condition has a song entitled "The Once And Future King" on their albums What the Waves Were Always Saying and To the Night Sky.


British singer Gary Hughes published two albums titled Once and Future King Part I and Once and Future King Part II.


German power metal band Blind Guardian has a song about King Arthur, titled "A Past and Future Secret" and containing the line "Most called him Once and Future King".


British indie band Bloc Party have a song titled "The Once And Future King", released as a b-side and not included in their album A Weekend in the City.


The television series One Tree Hill quotes the book in episode 202. The main character, Lucas, in a voiceover says, "T. H. White said perhaps we all give the best of our hearts uncritically, to those who hardly think about us in return."


In the 2006 Emilio Estevez film Bobby, the character Edward (Laurence Fishburne) explains the Arthurian legend to José - one of his kitchen staff - after José performs a particularly selfless act. Afterward, Edward is seen honouring José by drawing a picture of a crown on the tiled wall behind them, and then writing the title The Once and Future King. Later in the film, the scrawl can be seen again, this time, spattered with the blood from those injured during the Robert Kennedy assassination and perhaps even from Kennedy himself. Thus Estevez suggests that, although Camelot is dead, noble souls like José embody hope for the future of our world.


The webcomic xkcd mentions The Once & Future King, saying that for Merlin good-byes meant nothing, while first hellos were tearful and bittersweet. Merlin also finds the movie Memento straightforward. [1]


Stewart Brand, founder and editor of the Whole Earth Catalog, has written that his mentor, the polymath Gregory Bateson, was deeply moved by the psychological astuteness and ecological awareness of The Once & Future King.


Kelly Link's short story "Lull" features a sub-story with an end-to-beginning structure similar to Merlin's life in The Once & Future King.


* The Once & Future King featured prominently in the film adaptation of Rodman Philbrick's "Freak the Mighty." Max Kane and Kevin Dillon bond through the book, and inspired by Dillon's fits of fancy, the two embark on a quest to embody the heroic qualities of King Arthur.


1970's American rock band Pavlov's Dog has a song entitled "Of Once and Future Kings" on their album "Pampered Menial".
