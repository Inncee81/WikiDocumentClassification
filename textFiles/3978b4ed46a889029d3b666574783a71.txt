[edit] General case
A random vector  follows a multivariate normal distribution if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

every linear combination  is normally distributed


there is a random vector , whose components are independent standard normal random variables, a vector  and an  matrix  such that .


there is a vector μ and a symmetric, positive semi-definite matrix  such that the characteristic function of X is








If  is non-singular, then the distribution may be described by the following PDF:



where  is the determinant of . Note how the equation above reduces to that of the univariate normal distribution if  is a scalar (i.e., a 1x1 matrix).
The vector μ in these conditions is the expected value of X and the matrix  is the covariance matrix of the components Xi. (If, as in MATLAB, each column of  represents a variable with the observations along that column, the covariance matrix would be .)
It is important to realize that the covariance matrix must be allowed to be singular (thus not described by above formula for which  is defined). That case arises frequently in statistics; for example, in the distribution of the vector of residuals in ordinary linear regression problems. Note also that the Xi are in general not independent; they can be seen as the result of applying the linear transformation A to a collection of independent Gaussian variables Z.
That the distribution of a random vector X is a multivariate normal distribution can be written in the following notation:



or to make it explicitly known that X is N-dimensional,




[edit] Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function (cdf) F(x) is defined as the probability that all values in a random vector X are less than or equal to the corresponding values in vector x. Though there is no closed form for F(x), there are a number of algorithms that estimate it numerically. For example, see MVNDST under [1] (includes FORTRAN code) or [2] (includes MATLAB code).

[edit] A counterexample
The fact that two random variables X and Y both have a normal distribution does not imply that the pair (X, Y) has a joint normal distribution. A simple example is one in which Y = X if |X| > 1 and Y = −X if |X| < 1. This is also true for more than two random variables.
Also see normally distributed and uncorrelated does not imply independent.

[edit] Normally distributed and independent
If X and Y are normally distributed and independent, this implies they are "jointly normally distributed", i.e., the pair (X, Y) must have bivariate normal distribution. However, a pair of jointly normally distributed variables need not be independent.

[edit] Bivariate case
In the 2-dimensional nonsingular case, the probability density function (with mean (0,0)) is



where ρ is the correlation between X and Y. In this case,




[edit] Affine transformation
If  is an affine transformation of  where  is an  vector of constants and  an  matrix, then  has a multivariate normal distribution with expected value  and variance  i.e., . In particular, any subset of the  has a marginal distribution that is also multivariate normal. To see this, consider the following example: to extract the subset , use



which extracts the desired elements directly.
Another corollary would be that the distribution of , where b is a vector the same length as X and the dot indicates a vector product, would be univariate Gaussian with . This result follows by using



and considering only the first component of the product (the first row of B is the vector b). Observe how the positive-definiteness of Σ implies that the variance of the dot product must be positive.

[edit] Geometric interpretation
The equidensity contours of a non-singular multivariate normal distribution are ellipsoids (i.e. linear transformations of hyperspheres) centered at the mean[1]. The directions of the principal axes of the ellipsoids are given by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix Σ. The squared relative lengths of the principal axes are given by the corresponding eigenvalues.
If Σ = UΛUT = UΛ1 / 2(UΛ1 / 2)T is an eigendecomposition where the columns of U are unit eigenvectors and Λ is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues, then we have







Moreover, U can be chosen to be a rotation matrix, as inverting an axis does not have any effect on N(0,Λ), but inverting a column changes the sign of U's determinant. The distribution N(μ,Σ) is in effect N(0,I) scaled by Λ1 / 2, rotated by U and translated by μ.
Conversely, any choice of μ, full rank matrix U, and positive diagonal entries Λi yields a non-singular multivariate normal distribution. If any Λi is zero and U is square, the resulting covariance matrix UΛUT is singular. Geometrically this means that every contour ellipsoid is infinitely thin and has zero volume in n-dimensional space, as at least one of the principal axes has length of zero.

[edit] Correlations and independence
In general, random variables may be uncorrelated but highly dependent. But if a random vector has a multivariate normal distribution then any two or more of its components that are uncorrelated are independent. This implies that any two or more of its components that are pairwise independent are independent.
But it is not true that two random variables that are (separately, marginally) normally distributed and uncorrelated are independent. Two random variables that are normally distributed may fail to be jointly normally distributed, i.e., the vector whose components they are may fail to have a multivariate normal distribution. For an example of two normally distributed random variables that are uncorrelated but not independent, see normally distributed and uncorrelated does not imply independent.

[edit] Higher moments
The kth-order moments of X are defined by



where 
The central k-order central moments are given as follows
(a) If k is odd, .
(b) If k is even with k = 2λ, then



where the sum is taken over all allocations of the set  into λ (unordered) pairs. That is, if you have a kth ( = 2λ = 6) central moment, you will be summing the products of λ = 3 covariances (the -μ notation has been dropped in the interests of parsimony):



This yields (2λ − 1)! / (2λ − 1(λ − 1)!) terms in the sum (15 in the above case), each being the product of λ (in this case 3) covariances. For fourth order moments (four variables) there are three terms. For sixth-order moments there are 3 × 5 = 15 terms, and for eighth-order moments there are 3 × 5 × 7 = 105 terms.
The covariances are then determined by replacing the terms of the list  by the corresponding terms of the list consisting of r1 ones, then r2 twos, etc... To illustrate this, examine the following 4th-order central moment case:







where σij is the covariance of Xi and Xj. The idea with the above method is you first find the general case for a kth moment where you have k different X variables -  and then you can simplify this accordingly. Say, you have  then you simply let Xi = Xj and realise that .

[edit] Conditional distributions
If μ and Σ are partitioned as follows

 with sizes 


 with sizes 

then the distribution of x1 conditional on x2 = a is multivariate normal  where



and covariance matrix



This matrix is the Schur complement of  in . This means that to calculate the conditional covariance matrix, one inverts the overall covariance matrix, drops the rows and columns corresponding to the variables being conditioned upon, and then inverts back to get the conditional covariance matrix.
Note that knowing that x2 = a alters the variance, though the new variance does not depend on the specific value of a; perhaps more surprisingly, the mean is shifted by ; compare this with the situation of not knowing the value of a, in which case x1 would have distribution .
The matrix  is known as the matrix of regression coefficients.

[edit] Bivariate conditional expectation
In the case

Then

where this latter ratio is often called the Inverse Mills ratio.

[edit] Fisher information matrix
The Fisher information matrix (FIM) for a normal distribution takes a special formulation. The (m,n) element of the FIM for  is



where




tr is the trace function


[edit] Kullback-Leibler divergence
The Kullback-Leibler divergence from N0N(μ0,Σ0) to N1N(μ1,Σ1) is:



The logarithm must be taken to base e since the two terms following the logarithm are themselves base-e logarithms of expressions that are either factors of the density function or otherwise arise naturally. The divergence above is measured in nats. Dividing the entire expression above by loge 2 yields the divergence in bits.

[edit] Estimation of parameters
The derivation of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution is perhaps surprisingly subtle and elegant. See estimation of covariance matrices.
In short, the probability density function (pdf) of an N-dimensional multivariate normal is



and the ML estimator of the covariance matrix from a sample of n observations is



which is simply the sample covariance matrix. This is a biased estimator whose expectation is



An unbiased sample covariance is




[edit] Entropy
The differential entropy of the multivariate normal distribution is [2]



where  is the determinant of the covariance matrix Σ.

[edit] Multivariate normality tests
Multivariate normality tests check a given set of data for similarity to the multivariate normal distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data set is similar to the normal distribution, therefore a sufficiently small p-value indicates non-normal data. Multivariate normality tests include the Cox-Small test [3] and Smith and Jain's adaptation [4] of the Friedman-Rafsky test.

[edit] Drawing values from the distribution
A widely used method for drawing a random vector X from the N-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with mean vector μ and covariance matrix Σ (required to be symmetric and positive-definite) works as follows:

Compute the Cholesky decomposition of Σ, that is, find the unique lower triangular matrix A such that . Note that any other matrix A satisfying this condition, that is one which is a square root of Σ, could be used but often finding such a matrix other than by the Cholesky decomposition would be more computationally expensive.
Let  be a vector whose components are N independent standard normal variates (which can be generated, for example, by using the Box-Muller transform).
Let  be
