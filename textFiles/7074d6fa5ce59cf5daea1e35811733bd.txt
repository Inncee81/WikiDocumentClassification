Former Apple evangelist


Guy Kawasaki (Born August 30, 1954) is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. He was one of the Apple employees originally responsible for marketing the Macintosh in 1984 and is noted for bringing the concept of evangelism to the high-tech business[1], focusing on creating passionate user-advocates for the Apple brand.
Kawasaki was a former Apple Fellow and, after leaving the company, became CEO of ACIUS, which produced the 4th Dimension database program. He also started the company Fog City Software. Recently, he has been involved in the rumor reporting site, Truemors, and an RSS aggregator, Alltop. As of August 2008, his blog "How to Change the World" is ranked 88th most-popular globally.[2]
Kawasaki has a B.A. in psychology from Stanford University and an MBA from University of California, Los Angeles. He is Japanese American and a native of Honolulu, Hawaii, where he attended the Iolani School.
He is currently a Managing Director of Garage Technology Ventures, a venture capital firm which specializes in high-technology start-up firms located in Silicon Valley, California, as well as co-founder of Nononina, the company that created the Truemors and Alltop websites. He is also an advisor for Jajah, on invitation from co-founder Roman Scharf.
