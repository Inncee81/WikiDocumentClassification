[edit] Formal education
He graduated from Milton Academy and then went on to earn higher educational degrees: B.A. summa cum laude (economics), Skull and Bones Yale University, 1991; M.A. (economics), Yale University, 1991; Ph.D. (economics), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1995. He was an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow (2000-02) and Fulbright Scholar (2006-07).[3]

[edit] Personal life
Goolsbee was born to Linda and Arthur Goolsbee in Waco, Texas, and raised primarily in Whittier, California. As a high school student at Milton Academy, a New England preparatory school, Goolsbee became one of the most decorated competitive speakers in the nation. In 1987, he became the first extemporaneous speaking competitor to go through an entire year of competitions placing only first. This included winning the NCFL national championship in extemporaneous speaking for the second time and winning the National Forensics League's national championship in international extemporaneous speaking as well as placing second in the nation in original oratory.
As a student at Yale University he debated in the American Parliamentary Debate Association circuit, and in the Yale Political Union. In 1991, he and partner David Gray were the National Debate Team of the Year and Goolsbee finished as the third-best speaker at the World Debate Championships in Toronto. In 1990 he and partner Dahlia Lithwick were runners up for National Debate Team of the Year. He and partner John Wertheim placed second at the national championship. Goolsbee later served as coach to the M.I.T. debate team and the University of Chicago debate society. In 1991, Austan Goolsbee was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society.
He is a frequently seen around the University of Chicago and Hyde Park. He is active in the Latke-Hamantash Debate and the New York Times travel magazine piece on classic Hyde Park bar Jimmy's Woodlawn Tap mentions him and high school friend Mo Lee as frequent patrons.[4]
Goolsbee married Robin Winters on November 1, 1997. She was a management consultant with McKinsey & Company at the time and earlier the director of business development at MTV International.[5] They have a daughter, Aden, and two sons, Addison and Emitt.

[edit] Academic and public service
Goolsbee has been a Research Fellow at the American Bar Foundation,[6] Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[7] and a member of the Panel of Economic Advisors to the Congressional Budget Office.[8] He is Senior Economist to the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI).[9]He has been Barack Obama's economic advisor since Obama's successful U.S. Senate campaign in Illinois. He advised Barack Obama in his 2004 Senate race and was the senior economic advisor to the 2008 Obama presidential campaign[10] .[11] He was interviewed in January 2008 about the Obama economic plan on tax cuts, deficits, and trade policies.[12]
Goolsbee's academic research focuses on the Internet, the new economy, government policy, and taxes. He currently teaches a class on economics and policy in the telecom, media and technology industries. He is known in political circles as a centrist and in academic circles as part of a new wave called "new social economics". Along with Steven Levitt, author of Freakonomics, he and others focus on human activity in natural settings and find economic explanations for how people behave.[13]

[edit] Recognition
Over the years he has been named one of the 100 Global Leaders for Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, one of the six 'Gurus of the Future' by the Financial Times, one of the 40 Under 40 by Crain's Chicago Business, and one of the 30 Under 30 by the Chicago Sun-Times.[14]
Some of the known press profiles of him include those done by NPR, [15] George Will,[16] the Financial Times,[17] Reuters TV,[18] the Chicago Tribune,[19] Crain's Chicago Business,[20], Politico [21] and the Abilene Reporter-News.[22]

[edit] Publications and media appearances
Goolsbee is known for his ability to explain economic and business issues clearly. He is the former host of the television show History's Business on the History Channel, and he appeared frequently as a surrogate for the Obama presidential campaign. He became known as the 'Master of the One Liner' for his performance in cable debates [23]
This is also true for his writing. In April 2006, Goolsbee began writing for the Economic Scene column in the New York Times. This column was later moved to Sundays and renamed the Economic View. Before that he wrote the Dismal Science column for Slate.com, for which he won the 2006 Peter Lisagor Award for Exemplary Journalism. He has many published papers in various peer-reviewed journals.[24]

[edit] Criticism
Goolsbee was the senior economic advisor to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign until a Canadian memo was leaked regarding a visit Goolsbee paid to that country's officials at their consulate in Chicago in April 2008. Critics claimed that at the meeting Goolsbee said that Obama did not really oppose NAFTA as claimed in the Ohio debate. Hillary Clinton's campaign ran ads in Ohio making the charge the day before the primary. Goolsbee, the Obama campaign and the Canadian Consulate all denied that any such statement had occurred. Days later, Canadian News admitted the initial story had not been accurate and the Prime Minister of Canada made a public apology. [25]
Later reports seemed to suggest that actually it had actually been the Clinton campaign which had given assurances to the Canadian government but this was not proven.[26]
Following the incident, the Canadian government launched an official investigation as to the source of the leak but they were unable to determine who was responsible. Rumors held that the information had first come from the Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff himself Ian Brodie. Brodie resigned the day before the report was publicly released but claimed the timing was purely coincidental.
