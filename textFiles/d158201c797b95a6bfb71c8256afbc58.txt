From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Principality of Sealand has been described as the world's best-known micronation.[1]


Micronations, sometimes also referred to as model countries and new country projects, are small, self-proclaimed entities that claim to be independent sovereign states but which are not acknowledged as such by any recognised sovereign state, or by any supranational organisation. They should not be confused with microstates, which are recognised independent states of a small size, nor should they be confused with unrecognised states, which have indisputably real claims to sovereign state status.[2]
Motivations for the creation of micronations include theoretical experimentation, political protest, artistic expression, personal entertainment or the conduct of criminal activity.[3] Micronations can also exist in various forms, including in the physical world (on land, at sea and in outer space), online, in the minds of their creators—or some combination of these. Some micronations have even managed to extend their operations into the physical world by issuing coins, flags, postage stamps, passports, medals, and other items.
