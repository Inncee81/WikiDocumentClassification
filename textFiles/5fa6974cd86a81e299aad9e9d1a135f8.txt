In computing, software that is copyrighted and licensed under a software license is done under a variety of licensing schemes. For end-users there are proprietary licenses and there are free software licenses. Within these schemes are further classifications. There are also different licensing schemes for access to and use of source code. To address special intellectual property issues regarding source code, Open Source licenses and special copyright schemes, such as copyleft, have been created.
Not all software is licensed, or even copyrighted, and this article is thus not an exhaustive list of the terms under which software is available. Software may be published without an accompanying license, as License-Free Software, in which case it remains copyrighted, its distribution is subject to ordinary copyright law, and its sale is subject to ordinary sales law. Software may also be released to the public domain, in which case it is not copyrighted and the notion of a copyright license simply does not apply at all (although the other parts of a software licence, including warranty provisions, will still apply to the sale of such software).

[edit] Open source / free software licenses
The terms "Open source licenses", and "free software licenses" are usually interchangeable. There are minor differences, but these occur only in fringe areas. In general, for a license to be considered "open source", it is approved by Open Source Initiative, and for a license to be "free software", it should be approved by Free Software Foundation.

[edit] Free software licenses

[edit] GPL 2 compatible
The GNU General Public License is a popular license, with offerings including Linux, such that it is useful to know if the license chosen is compatible with it. Knowing compatibility is important if a developer wants to avail him- or herself of the wide GPL software 'commons'.
