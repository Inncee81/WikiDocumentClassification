The COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO) is an algorithmic Software Cost Estimation Model developed by Barry Boehm. The model uses a basic regression formula, with parameters that are derived from historical project data and current project characteristics.

[edit] Overview
COCOMO was first published in 1981 Barry W. Boehm's Book Software engineering economics[1] as a model for estimating effort, cost, and schedule for software projects. It drew on a study of 63 projects at TRW Aerospace where Barry Boehm was Director of Software Research and Technology in 1981. The study examined projects ranging in size from 2,000 to 100,000 lines of code, and programming languages ranging from assembly to PL/I. These projects were based on the waterfall model of software development which was the prevalent software development process in 1981.
References to this model typically call it COCOMO 81. In 1997 COCOMO II was developed and finally published in 2001 in the book Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II[2]. COCOMO II is the successor of COCOMO 81 and is better suited for estimating modern software development projects. It provides more support for modern software development processes and an updated project database. The need for the new model came as software development technology moved from mainframe and overnight batch processing to desktop development, code reusability and the use of off-the-shelf software components. This article refers to COCOMO 81.
COCOMO consists of a hierarchy of three increasingly detailed and accurate forms. The first level, Basic COCOMO is good for quick, early, rough order of magnitude estimates of software costs, but its accuracy is limited due to its lack of factors to account for difference in project attributes (Cost Drivers). Intermediate COCOMO takes these Cost Drivers into account and Detailed COCOMO additionally accounts for the influence of individual project phases.

[edit] Basic COCOMO
Basic COCOMO is a static, single-valued model that computes software development effort (and cost) as a function of program size expressed in estimated lines of code. COCOMO applies to three classes of software projects:

Organic projects - are relatively small, simple software projects in which small teams with good application experience work to a set of less than rigid requirements.
Semi-detached projects - are intermediate (in size and complexity) software projects in which teams with mixed experience levels must meet a mix of rigid and less than rigid requirements.
Embedded projects - are software projects that must be developed within a set of tight hardware, software, and operational constraints.

The basic COCOMO equations take the form

E=ab(KLOC)bb
D=cb(E)db
P=E/D

where E is the effort applied in person-months, D is the development time in chronological months, KLOC is the estimated number of delivered lines of code for the project (expressed in thousands), and P is the number of people required. The coefficients ab, bb, cb and db are given in the following table.

   Software project    ab      bb      cb      db
  
   Organic             2.4     1.05    2.5     0.38
   Semi-detached       3.0     1.12    2.5     0.35
   Embedded            3.6     1.20    2.5     0.32

Basic COCOMO is good for quick, early, rough order of magnitude estimates of software costs, but it does not account for differences in hardware constraints, personnel quality and experience, use of modern tools and techniques, and other project attributes known to have a significant influence on software costs, which limits its accuracy.

[edit] Intermediate COCOMO
Intermediate COCOMO computes software development effort as function of program size and a set of "cost drivers" that include subjective assessment of product, hardware, personnel and project attributes. This extension considers a set of four "cost drivers", each with a number of subsidiary attributes:

Product attributes

Required software reliability
Size of application database
Complexity of the product


Hardware attributes

Run-time performance constraints
Memory constraints
Volatility of the virtual machine environment
Required turnabout time


Personnel attributes

Analyst capability
Software engineering capability
Applications experience
Virtual machine experience
Programming language experience


Project attributes

Use of software tools
Application of software engineering methods
Required development schedule



Each of the 15 attributes receives a rating on a six-point scale that ranges from "very low" to "extra high" (in importance or value). An effort multiplier from the table below applies to the rating. The product of all effort multipliers results in an effort adjustment factor (EAF). Typical values for EAF range from 0.9 to 1.4.

The Intermediate Cocomo formula now takes the form:

E=ai(KLoC)(bi).EAF

where E is the effort applied in person-months, KLoC is the estimated number of thousands of delivered lines of code for the project, and EAF is the factor calculated above. The coefficient ai and the exponent bi are given in the next table.

The Development time D calculation uses E in the same way as in the Basic COCOMO.

[edit] Detailed COCOMO
Detailed COCOMO - incorporates all characteristics of the intermediate version with an assessment of the cost driver's impact on each step (analysis, design, etc.) of the software engineering process.
