Example of the shocker.


The shocker, also known colloquially as "two in the pink, one in the stink",[1][2] is a hand gesture with a sexual connotation. The ring finger and thumb are curled or bent down while the other fingers are extended. The index and middle fingers are kept together (touching) and the back of the hand faces outwards (away from the gesturer). The gesture refers to the act of inserting the index and middle fingers into a vagina and the little finger into the unwitting anus, hence the "shock".

[edit] Occurrences in culture




The shocker should not be confused with similar looking hand gestures such as "The Pitchfork," (pictured above) which is a hand signal used at Arizona State University. (notice the spacing between the Index and middle finger)[3]


The shocker as a hand gesture has been used as "Big Shocker", a derivative of the foam finger that displays the shocker on an oversized foam glove sold by CollegeHumor. Wichita State University students use the shocker at basketball.[4][5][6] There is a song by Peaches about the shocker called "Rock The Shocker".
As for the actual use of the shocker, a columnist at The Daily Californian (the student newspaper at Berkeley) expressed her dissatisfaction with it during sex.[1]
