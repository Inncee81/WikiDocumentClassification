[edit] Biography

[edit] Early career
Satoshi Kon is a film director from Kushiro, Hokkaidō, Japan. Kon attended Musashino College of the Arts and intended to become a painter.[1] After college, he worked with Katsuhiro Ōtomo on the manga World Apartment Horror.[1] Kon entered the anime industry by working as set designer for Roujin Z (1991), for which Ōtomo was the screenwriter and mechanical designer.[1] Kon's early work was strongly influenced by Ōtomo due to Kon's experience with him.[1] Afterwards, Kon made his screenwriting debut with "Magnetic Rose", a section of the anthology film Memories.[1]

[edit] Directorial work
In 1997, Satoshi Kon released his directorial debut film Perfect Blue, which was turned into a feature film from an original video animation in the middle of production.[1] His next film, Millennium Actress, was released in 2001 to several film festivals and won numerous awards.[1] Having created two films that blend dreams and reality, Kon decided to work on a more linear and traditional story and directed Tokyo Godfathers, his only film to date that doesn't deal with subjective reality.[1] After creating the television series Paranoia Agent, Kon finished work on Paprika, a feature-length film that received a wide release to cinemas worldwide in 2007.
