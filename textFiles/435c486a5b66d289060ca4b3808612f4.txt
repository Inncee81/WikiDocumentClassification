[edit] Biography
Huyghe was born in 1962 and trained at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs. In 2001 Huyghe represented France at the Venice Biennale, where his pavilion, entitled Le Château de Turing, won a special prize from the jury. In 2002 Huyghe won the Hugo Boss Prize from the Guggenheim Museum and exhibited several works there the following year. In 2006, Huyghe's film A Journey That Wasn't was exhibited at the Whitney Biennial in New York, and at the re-opening of ARC/MAM and Tate Modern. He is represented by the Marian Goodman Gallery.

[edit] His Artwork
Much of Huyghe's work examines the structural properties of film and its problematic relationship to reality. His work frequently mixes fact with fiction.[1] In several projects, he has delved into the personal lives of subjects and actors in film.

[edit] Third Memory
His two-channel video The Third Memory (1999), first exhibited in a museum context at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and The Renaissance Society in Chicago, takes as its starting point Sidney Lumet's 1975 film Dog Day Afternoon, starring Al Pacino in the role of the bank robber John Wojtowicz. Huyghe's video reconstructs the set of Lumet's film, but he allows Wojtowicz himself, now a few dozen years older and out of jail, to tell the story of the robbery. Huyghe juxtaposes images from the reconstruction with footage from Dog Day Afternoon, demonstrating that Wojtowicz's memory has been irrevocably altered by the film about his life.[2]

[edit] No Ghost Just A Shell
In 1999, in collaboration with Philipe Parreno, Hughye purchased the rights to a manga figure who they named 'Annlee' for $428.[3] They invited other artists including Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster and Rirkrit Tiravanija to produce animated videos using Annlee.[4] After a several exhibitions, they transferred the character's copyright to the Annlee Association -- a legal entity that owned by Annlee, thus ensuring her simultaneous freedom and death.[5]
