Wings 3D is a free and open source polygon mesh subdivision modeler inspired by Nendo and Mirai from Izware, all using the winged edge data structure.
Wings 3D is available for most platforms, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, using the Erlang environment.
Wings 3D is ideally suited for modeling and texturing low to medium density polygon meshes. It has a wide range of very effective tools optimised for these tasks hidden behind its 'minimalistic' interface.
Designed as a stand-alone modeler, without animation or 'proper' rendering facilities it should not be confused with software that does include such features - although its modeling capabilities stand extremely favourable comparison with equivalent sections of such applications - whether free or commercial.
The use of 'context-sensitive' menus is the reason for its sparse look, whereby tool menus relevant to the current selection mode are only displayed when needed - so no 'greyed out' options.
Wings' toolset often provides the user with many different workflow options for modeling and thus allows considerable flexibility of technique within its 'box-modeling' / 'winged edge' paradigm. (one example being the provision of a 'hole' material, thus allowing wings models to be exported to a wide range of other apps.)
The intuitive nature of Wings 3D means it has a fairly short learning curve, but offers many pleasant surprises to people prepared to investigate it a little deeper.
Whilst it lacks its own powerful internal renderer, Wings can be combined with raytracing programs such as POV-Ray, YafRay, or Art of Illusion etc. to produce high-quality images.
Many other (industry standard) import / export facilities are also present.
