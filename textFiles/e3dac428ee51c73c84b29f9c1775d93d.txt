In computing, R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is an implementation of the S programming language with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme.
R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is now developed by the R Development Core Team. It is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly as a play on the name of S.[1] The R language has become a de facto standard among statisticians for the development of statistical software.[2][3]
R is widely used for statistical software development and data analysis.[4] R is part of the GNU project[5], and its source code is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems. R uses a command line interface, though several graphical user interfaces are available.

[edit] Features
R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and others) and graphical techniques. R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered. Much of R's system is itself written in the language, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.
R is also highly extensible through the use of user-submitted packages for specific functions or specific areas of study. Due to its S heritage, R has stronger object-oriented programming facilities than most statistical computing languages. Extending R is also eased by its permissive lexical scoping rules.[6]
Another of R's strengths is its graphical facilities, which produce publication-quality graphs which can include mathematical symbols. R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hard copy.
Although R is mostly used by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, it can also be used as a general matrix calculation toolbox with comparable benchmark results to GNU Octave and its proprietary counterpart, MATLAB (version < 7).[7]

[edit] Packages
The capabilities of R are extended through user-submitted packages, which allow specialized statistical techniques, graphical devices, as well as programming interfaces and import/export capabilities to many external data formats. These packages are developed in R, LaTeX, Java, and often C and Fortran. A core set of packages are included with the installation of R, with a total of 1628 (as of November 2008) available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Notable packages by subject area are listed along with comments on the official R Task View pages.

[edit] Development
The bioinformatics community has seeded a successful effort to use R for the analysis of data from molecular biology laboratories. The bioconductor project, which started in the fall of 2001, provides R packages for the analysis of genomic data, such as Affymetrix and cDNA microarray object-oriented data handling and analysis tools.
The Gnumeric developers have cooperated with the R project to improve the accuracy of Gnumeric.[8]

[edit] Milestones

Version 0.16 – This is the last alpha version developed primarily by Ihaka and Gentleman. Much of the basic functionality from the "White Book" (see S history) was implemented. The mailing lists commenced on April 1, 1997.
Version 0.49 – April 23, 1997 – This is the oldest available source release, and compiles on a limited number of Unix-like platforms [1]. CRAN is started on this date, with 3 mirrors that initially hosted 12 packages [2]. Alpha versions of R for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS are made available shortly after this version.
Version 0.60 – December 5, 1997 – R becomes an official part of the GNU Project [3]. The code is hosted and maintained on CVS (since September 17, 1997 — although anonymous access wasn't granted until November 12, 1999).
Version 1.0.0 – February 29, 2000 – Considered stable enough for production use [4].
Version 1.4.0 - December 19, 2001 – S4 methods are introduced [5], and the first version for Mac OS X is made available soon after [6].
Version 2.0.0 – October 4, 2004 – Introduced lazy loading, which enables fast loading of data with minimal expense of system memory [7].
Version 2.1.0 – April 18, 2005 – Support for UTF-8 encoding, and the beginnings of internationalization and localization for different languages [8].
Version 2.5.0 – April 24, 2007 – Object name completion by integration of package ‘rcompletion’, and ‘Rscript’ front-end, which enables shell-like R scripting [9].
Version 2.6.0 – October 3, 2007 – Improved handling of data with a large number of identical strings [10].
Version 2.7.0 – April 22, 2008 – Improvements of graphics output, and change of default device from PostScript to PDF [11].
Version 2.8.0 - October 20, 2008 - var(), cov(), cor(), sd() etc now by default (when 'use' is not specified) return NA in many cases where they signalled an error before.


[edit] Productivity tools
There are various interfaces to R.

[edit] Editors and IDEs
Bluefish[11], ConTEXT, Eclipse[12], Emacs (Emacs Speaks Statistics), Geany, jEdit[13], Kate[14], Syn[15], TextMate, Tinn-R[16], Vim, SciTE, Smultron, and WinEdt (R Package RWinEdt).

[edit] Scripting languages
R functionality has been made accessible from several scripting languages such as Python (by the RPy[17] interface package) and Perl (by the Statistics::R[18] module).

[edit] Commercial tools
There are several commercialized or enterprise versions of R, which include support and services.

R+[19] from XL Solutions.
REvolution R,[20] (formerly RPro) and ParallelR[21] with parallel processing capabilities, from REvolution Computing
RStat,[22] several editions available
WebFOCUS RStat, a business intelligence (BI)-enabled version of R from Information Builders.


[edit] Finding information about R
The brevity of R's name makes it difficult to use search engines to find information about it. Specialist sources include RSeek [23] and the R Search Engine [24].

[edit] CRAN
R and user-submitted packages are commonly distributed through CRAN, which is an acronym for the Comprehensive R Archive Network. There are over 60 CRAN mirrors worldwide, with the head-node (http://cran.r-project.org/) located at the Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien in Vienna, Austria. One way of searching for information about R is to find sites that link to CRAN.

[edit] R News
An open access newsletter called R News is released online two to three times a year featuring statistical computing and development articles that might be of interest to both users and developers of R. Articles are anonymously peer-reviewed. It has been in press since January 2001.[25]
