In a general sense, the term information system (IS) refers to a system of people, data records and activities that process the data and information in an organization, and it includes the organization's manual and automated processes. In a narrow sense, the term information system (or computer-based information system) refers to the specific application software that is used to store data records in a computer system and automates some of the information-processing activities of the organization. Computer-based information systems are in the field of information technology. The discipline of business process modelling describes the business processes supported by information systems.

[edit] Overview
There are various types of information systems, for example: transaction processing systems, decision support systems, knowledge management systems, database management systems, and office information systems. Critical to most information systems are information technologies, which are typically designed to enable humans to perform tasks for which the human brain is not well suited, such as: handling large amounts of information, performing complex calculations, and controlling many simultaneous processes.
Information technologies are a very important and malleable resource available to executives.[1] Many companies have created a position of Chief Information Officer (CIO) that sits on the executive board with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Chief Technical Officer (CTO).The CTO may also serve as CIO, and vice versa. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who focuses on information security within an organization, normally reports to the CIO.
In computer security, an information system is described by the following components [2]:

Repositories, which hold data permanently or temporarily, such as buffers, RAM, hard disks, cache, etc. Often data stored in repositories is managed through a database management system.
Interfaces, which support the interaction between humans and computers, such as keyboards, speakers, scanners, printers, etc.
Channels, which connect repositories, such as routers, cables, wireless links, etc.


[edit] Information systems careers
Information Systems has a number of different areas of work:

Information systems strategy
Information systems management
Information systems development
Information systems security

There are a wide variety of career paths in the information systems discipline. "Workers with specialized technical knowledge and strong communications skills will have the best prospects. People with management skills and an understanding of business practices and principles will have excellent opportunities, as companies are increasingly looking to technology to drive their revenue." [3]

[edit] Types of information systems
As new information technologies are developed, new categories emerge that can be used to classify information systems. Some examples are:

Transaction processing systems
Management information systems
Decision support systems
Expert systems
Business intelligence


[edit] Information systems development
Information technology departments in larger organizations tend to strongly influence information technology development, use, and application in the organizations, which may be a business or corporation. A computer based information system, following a definition of Langefors[4], is:

a technologically implemented medium for recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions,
as well as for drawing conclusions from such expressions.

which can be formulated as a generalized information systems design mathematical program.

[edit] Information systems development methodology
Information systems development methodology or ISDM is a tool kit of ideas,approaches, techniques and tools which system analysts use to help them translate organisational needs into appropriate Information Systems;
An ISDM is:-
'....recommended collection of philosophies, phases, procedures, rules, techniques, tools, documentation, management, and training for developers of Information Systems”. (Avison and Fitzgerald, 1988)

[edit] Information systems research
Information systems research is generally concerned with the study of the effects of information systems on the behavior of individuals, groups, and organizations.[5][6] Notable publication outlets for information systems research are the journals Management Information Systems Quarterly, Information Systems Research, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, and Communications of the Association for Information Systems.
Since information systems is an applied field, industry practitioners expect information systems research to generate findings that are immediately applicable in practice. However, that is not always the case. Often information systems researchers explore behavioral issues in much more depth than practitioners would expect them to do. This may render information systems research results difficult to understand, and has led to criticism.[7]
