[edit] Origin
Beryl was the project name for the Quinnstorm branch of Compiz, announced on 19 September 2006 after Quinnstorm and the development team decided that the fork had come too far from the original Compiz started by Novell (compiz-vanilla). After the Novell XGL/Compiz team (mostly David Reveman) refused the proposition to merge the Quinnstorm changes with compiz-vanilla, the decision was made to make a real differentiation.[2][3] In 2007, they remerged into Compiz-Fusion.

[edit] Differences
Notable differences between Compiz and Beryl were the following:

The window decorator, formerly known as cgwd, was renamed emerald. A cgwd theme could be ported to emerald by changing the extension from .cgwd to .emerald.
Beryl used a flat file backend instead of gconf, no GNOME dependency.
Initially had a large variety of extra plugins, and enhanced features in other plugins, later however most of the functionality had been ported to the compiz-extra package[4][5]
Contained three themeable decorators: Emerald, Heliodor, and Aquamarine.
It had a theme manager called emerald-theme-manager.
Created by the community at Beryl Project Forums.


[edit] Window decorators




"Wobbly Windows" made windows move like jelly


Like Compiz and unlike traditional window managers, Beryl delegated the drawing of window borders to a separate process, called a window decorator. There were three of them, all named after varieties of beryl, although only Emerald was considered stable.

Emerald, the default window decorator and a continuation of cgwd, had its own theme format and supported effects like alpha transparency, a fork of Compiz's gtk-window-decorator.
Heliodor, another fork of Compiz's gtk-window-decorator, supported Metacity themes.
Aquamarine supported KWin themes.


[edit] System Requirements
According to the Beryl FAQ, Beryl ran acceptably well on a GeForce 3/Intel i855/Radeon 7500, 256MB of RAM, and a 1.2GHz processor, although the processor is not a strong requirement[citation needed]. Version 7.1 of Xorg and a recent version of Mesa 3D was recommended. [1]

[edit] Plugins
Included in the 0.1.4 release were the following plugins. As of the 0.1.4 release plugins were sorted into groups. Also introduced in 0.1.4 was a new plugin configuration interface that was more intuitive. Plugins were sorted into groups and the actual options for each plugin were also sorted more intuitively.

[edit] Releases
The first official release of the project (Version 0.1.0) along with Emerald and Beryl-manager came on 29 September 2006. The second 'stable' release (Version 0.2.0) came on 15 March 2007[6], shortly followed by an almost identical Version 0.2.1, the only changes being to update licensing and where the source code was stored[7].

[edit] Beryl-Compiz Merge
As of March 30, 2007, Beryl and Compiz have decided to merge their projects back into one[8]. The Beryl project has been shut down in favor of the new merged project Compiz Fusion[9]; its main activities will be focused on installation, configuration and additional plugins for addition to the core functionalities of Compiz, which will be responsible for core and base plugins.
