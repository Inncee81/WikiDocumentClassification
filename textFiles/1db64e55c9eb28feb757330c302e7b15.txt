The Prometheus Award is an award for libertarian science fiction novels given out annually by the Libertarian Futurist Society, which also publishes a quarterly journal, Prometheus. The award was founded in 1979 by L. Neil Smith, but was not awarded regularly until the newly-founded Libertarian Futurist Society revived it in 1982. A Hall of Fame Award (for classic works of libertarian science fiction, not necessarily novels) was created in 1983, and the Society also presents occasional one-off awards.
