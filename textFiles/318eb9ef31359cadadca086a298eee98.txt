[edit] Backward audio messages
A backward message in an audio recording is only fully apparent when the recording is played reversed. Some backward messages are produced by deliberate backmasking, while others are simply phonetic reversals resulting from random combinations of words.

[edit] Backmasking
Main article: Backmasking
Backmasking is a recording technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was popularized by The Beatles, who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album Revolver. Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic, and satiric effect, on both analog and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of songs[citation needed].
Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians, leading to record-burnings and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. In debate are both the existence of backmasked Satanic messages and the ability to subliminally affect listeners thereby.

[edit] Phonetic reversal
Main article: Phonetic reversal
Certain phrases produce a different phrase when their phonemes are reversed — a process known as phonetic reversal. For example, "kiss" backwards sounds like "sick," and so the title of Yoko Ono's Kiss Kiss Kiss sounds like "Sick Sick Sick" or "Six Six Six" backwards. The Paul is dead phenomenon was started in part because a phonetic reversal of "Number nine" was interpreted as "Turn me on, dead man".
According to proponents of reverse speech, phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.

[edit] Non-musical messages
Backward messages also exist in mediums outside of music, including computer games, music videos, Movies and television shows.
In his novel Ulysses (1922), James Joyce used a sly spelling pun for fuck (and cunt as well) with the doggerel verse:

   If you see Kay,
   Tell him he may.
   See you in tea,
   Tell him from me.

In the computer game Doom II, a garbled message played at the start of Map 30, spoken by the "Icon of Sin", can be played backwards to hear "To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero." Romero was a programmer for the game; he put the backwards message (with distortions) in to get back at the artists who put the image of his head on the final level.[1]
The player can use the no-clip cheat to enter the brain of the Icon of Sin to see Romero's head impaled on a stake. Shooting the head allows you to win the level, although the head emits a ghastly cry. (Normally the player is expected to shoot rockets at the exposed brain of Baphomet, killing Romero via splash damage.)
In the Xbox game Halo 2, if you listen closely to the Whisper In The Storm cutscene you'll notice that there are strange whispers in the background. When reversed and sped up, these whispers interpret a hidden prayer that says "I have walked among men and angels, for three thousand years. Time... has no end... No beginning... No purpose. I wander the earth. Seeking forgiveness for my horrible crimes and against god and man. I wish to seek death, destruction. Evil, over the light. But the light cannot be extinguished. I live in a prison of my own demise. I am lost... in time".[2][3][4] Listen to whipser_splice.mp3 on Bungie.org.
Stanley Kubrick, in his 1999 release, Eyes Wide Shut, features a scene depicting a Satanic ritual, where the soundtrack (the song "Masked Ball") consists of a backwards Orthodox liturgy chanted in Romanian.[5]
Blizzard Entertainment has released two games with known hidden audio messages. In Diablo, the message "Eat your vegetables and brush after every meal" is heard as the player enters the 16th level.[6] In Warcraft III, clicking on the Demon Hunter hero a number of times produces the backwards message "I love green trees", which sounds (forwards) like "siege niege avalya."[7]
The grand finale of the stage show The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged) by the Reduced Shakespeare Company consists of the comedy troupe performing the play Hamlet backwards. "Oh, yes," one of the performers quips, "and be sure to listen for the Satanic messages," leading to the obvious yelled joke: "Judas Priest is God!" As massive improvisation is an intentional part of the show, however, other celebrities (most notably Frank Sinatra) sometimes find themselves deified instead. Also used is the phrase 'reelect George Bush!'.[citation needed]
In one scene of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Beavis and Butt-Head hallucinate, and voices are heard in the background. The voices are the two characters speaking phrases such as "Everybody go to college, study hard, study hard."[8]
In the Clone High episode "Raisin the Stakes", JFK falls through the cafeteria sunroof, lands, and begins to foam at the mouth and speak gibberish. The gibberish played backwards is JFK saying "I am talking backwards, and telling you to watch Clone High ... and for us to get an Emmy ... I'm saying that backwards ... 'cause it's sneaky!"[9]
In the "Man of Science, Man of Faith" episode of Lost, Walt Lloyd is heard, and confirmed to be, speaking backwards, although fans argue on what he says. Two possible interpretations are "Don't push the button, the button is bad" and "Push the button, no button is bad".[10]
The Red Dwarf episode "Backwards" includes various backwards messages, including "Oi! Hey! Oi, you robbing bastards, that's our tandem!" and "I'm addressing the one prat in the country who's bothered to get hold of this recording, turn it round, and actually work out the rubbish that I'm saying. What a poor, sad life he's got!" The episode revolves around a return to an Earth where time is running backwards, so most of the dialogue in the show is backward. Most of the backward messages in this episode agree with the subtitled captions explaining them, with a few exceptions.[11]
The Simpsons episode "New Kids on the Blecch" involves the formation of a boy band, Party Posse, by Bart Simpson, Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum. The band's music videos contain military imagery and a group of Arabian belly-dancers who recite a seemingly Arab phrase, "Yvan Eht Nioj", which sounds like "Join the Navy" backwards.
An episode of "G.I. Joe" includes the backwards message, "Anybody listening to this message backwards must be a real dweeb", which is a reversal of an incantation spoken by Destro.[12]
The episode "Robotic Hymn of Doom", from The Brak Show, includes the message "Why are you listening to this song backwards, you could have been on a date with a girl". It is sung by Thundercleese as he was going to be shut down.[13]
At one point of the SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Opposite Day", SpongeBob and Patrick were talking backwards. When played normally it is gibberish but when it is played in reverse it has a hidden message. The conversation played in reverse:

(Both Laughing)
SpongeBob: To get to the opposite side.
Patrick: I give up.
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick.[14]


[edit] Visual messages
When rotated a certain way, an early 1990s Pepsi can will read "SEX." And if the Coca-Cola logo is flipped, you can read 2 Arabic words that debase Islam.
In the 1980s, Coca-Cola released in South Australia an advertising poster featuring the reintroduced contour bottle, with a speech bubble, "FEEL THE CURVES!". Inside one of the ice cubes was the silhouette of a woman performing fellatio. Thousands of posters were distributed to hotels and bottle shops in Australia before the mistake was discovered by Coca-Cola management. The artist of the poster was fired and all the posters were recalled.[citation needed]
Lucky Strike's old cigarette packaging, when rotated, supposedly shows a burning house, accompanying the Red Dot of Japan's flag and the trademark phrase "it's toasted".




A specially folded United States twenty-dollar bill


The American $20 bill allegedly contains a prediction of the September 11 terrorist attacks, despite being designed decades before the World Trade Center buildings were even built. When folded as shown, an image can be seen that resembles the Twin Towers in flames. This is true for all American dollar bills except for the one-dollar bill.
Conservative activist Donald Wildmon has claimed that The Walt Disney Company inserted the word "SEX" into the clouds in a scene in the animated film, The Lion King. According to Disney, however, the frame in question actually reads "SFX", a common abbreviation for "special effects", and was a signature by the effects animation team for their work. The lettering is ambiguous.[15]
Various other messages have been claimed to exist in Disney movies, some of them risque, such as the well-known allegation of an erection showing on a priest in The Little Mermaid. [16] According to the Snopes website however, only one "is clearly true [and] undeniably purposely inserted into the movie": images of a topless woman in two frames of The Rescuers.[17]
In 1982, Mark Lindsey, a graduate of Virginia Tech, submitted an entry for an addition to be built to the University of Virginia's football stadium. Lindsey realized that the stadium was in the shape of a "v" and promptly designed the new addition in the shape of the letter "t" to make the logo of the Virginia Tech Hokies. UVA officials were unaware that the design was a tribute to their in-state rival and picked Lindsey's plan. The addition was built in 1985 but replaced in 1999 after UVA officials discovered Lindsey's message.
PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is also the scene of a running battle with PETCO, a pet food retailer in San Diego, for several years regarding the purported mistreatment of live animals at PETCO stores. When the Padres announced that PETCO (which is based in San Diego) had obtained naming rights to PETCO Park, PETA was unable to persuade the Padres to terminate the agreement. Hence PETA used advertising in the form of an acrostic. It successfully purchased a brick with what appears on the surface to be a complimentary message: "Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!" However, if one takes the first letters of each word, the resulting acrostic reads "BOYCOTT PETCO". Neither PETCO nor the Padres have taken any action to remove the brick, stating that if someone walked by, they would not know it had anything to do with the PETA/PETCO feud.
The card game Army Of Zero contains hidden messages, which are revealed by arranging the game's card in various different configurations.

[edit] Windows Fonts
The letters "NYC" (New York City), when rendered in Webdings, form a rebus reading "I Love New York". When rendered in Wingdings, it arguably reads "Killing Jews is Good".
If these fonts are viewed in Internet Explorer, this table will show the results:


Font Name
Result


Normal
NYC


Webdings
NYC


Wingdings
NYC


The Webdings message was included deliberately. Wired News reports that "When Microsoft developed a new graphical font, Webdings, in 1997 ... typographers took pains to ensure that the image corresponding with the capital letters NYC was a pleasant one."[18]
The message in Wingdings, on the other hand, was investigated by Microsoft and the Anti-Defamation League and found to be a coincidence.[19]
