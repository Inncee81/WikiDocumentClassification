The Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet is not a phonetic alphabet in the sense in which that term is used in phonetics, i.e., it is not a system for transcribing speech sounds. See the phonetic alphabet disambiguation page, and also phonetic notation.

The Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet was a radio alphabet developed in 1941 and was used by all branches of the United States military until the promulgation of the NATO phonetic alphabet (Alfa, Bravo) in 1956, which replaced it. Before the Joint Army/Navy (JAN) phonetic alphabet, each branch of the armed forces used its own radio alphabet, leading to difficulties in interbranch communication.
The U.S. Army used this alphabet in modified form, along with the British Army and Canadian Army from 1943 on, with "Sugar" replacing "Sail".
The Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet was used as storm names for Atlantic basin hurricanes from 1950 to 1952 before being replaced with female names.
