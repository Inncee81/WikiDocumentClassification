Hofstadter's Law is a self-referencing time-related adage, coined by Douglas Hofstadter and named by himself.


“
It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
”


 

— Douglas Hofstadter, Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid[1]



Hofstadter's Law was a part of Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 magnum opus Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid. It is often cited among programmers, especially in discussions of techniques to improve productivity, such as The Mythical Man-Month or Extreme Programming.
