A VJ is a performance artist who creates moving visual art (often video) on large displays or screens, often at events such as concerts, nightclubs and music festivals, and usually in conjunction with other performance art. This results in a live, multimedia performance that can include music, actors or dancers as well as live and pre-recorded video.

[edit] Technology
Often using a video mixer, VJs blend and superimpose various video sources into a live motion composition. In recent years, electronic musical instrument makers have begun to make specialty equipment for VJing.

[edit] Hardware




EDIROL V-4 Videomixer


VJing developed initially by performers (mis)using existing video hardware and this tradition lives on with many VJs using a wide range of hardware products sourced from the broadcast TV industry and the home editing markets, as well as newer equipment designed specifically for VJs.
VJ hardware can be split into categories -

Source hardware generates a video picture which can be manipulated by the VJ, e.g. video cameras and Video Synthesizers.
Playback hardware plays back an existing video stream from disk or tape based storage mediums, e.g. VHS tape players and DVD players.
Mixing hardware allows the combining of multiple streams of video e.g. a Video Mixer
Effects hardware allows the adding of special effects to the video stream, e.g. Colour Correction units
Output hardware is for displaying the video signal, e.g. Video projector, LED wall, or Plasma Screen.


[edit] History
During the 1960s and '70s a number of video synthesizers were developed often as home electronics projects by backyard inventors, although a few notable exceptions such as the "CEL Electronics Chromascope" were commercially developed and sold for use in the developing nightclub scene.
In the 1980s the development of relatively cheap transistor and integrated circuit technology allowed the development of digital video effects hardware at a price point within the reach of individual VJs and nightclub owners.
The Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI), first produced in 1983, was revolutionary in this area, allowing complex digital effects to be applied in real time to video sources. The CVI became popular amongst television and music video producers and features in a number of music videos from the period.
By the 1990s, advancements in computing had brought video processing to the desktop computer. Early desktop editing systems such as the NewTek Video Toaster for the Amiga computer were quickly put to use by VJs seeking to create visuals for the emerging rave scene, whilst software developers began to develop systems specifically designed for live visuals such as O'Wonder's Bitbopper. [1]
The first known software created for VJs was Vujak - written for the Mac by EBN artist Brian Kane for use by the video art group he was part of - Emergency Broadcast Network.
Broadcasters by this point had become interested and a TV series on the UK's Channel 4 called Transambient, produced by UK artists Addictive TV put the art of the VJ on national television for the first time. A similar series called Two-Step soon also appeared on German channel VIVA.
The first commercially available and heavily produced VJ software was Motion Dive from Japanese company Digital Stage. By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing software available, including generative visuals programs such as MooNSTER, Aestesis and Advanced Visualization Studio, as well as video clip players such as ArKaos and VJamm. These new software products meant that VJs were now regularly taking computers to gigs.
The 90s also saw the development of a number of digital video mixers such as the Panasonic WJ-MX50 and WJ-AVE5. Although these mixers were designed for home video editing and low budget TV production, they were quickly adopted by VJs as the core component of their performance setups. Initially, video mixers were used to mix pre-prepared video material from VHSplayers and live camera sources, and later to add the new computer software outputs into their mix.
In 1998, Roland / Edirol released the V5 Video Canvas, which was a hybrid device featuring solid state storage of still images combined with a basic video mixer. The V5 marked an important transition point, where large music corporations saw an emerging market for video performance hardware. The products that followed the V5 have become the mainstay of VJ hardware setups. [2]
In 2001, Roland / Edirol released the V4 Video mixer, which was arguably the first video mixer designed specifically for VJ use. It features MIDI control to enable integration with digital music equipment, and quickly became adopted as the standard VJ mixer. The V4's popularity lead other music companies (notably Korg and Pioneer) to develop hardware designed specifically for VJs.
Today's VJs have a wide choice of off the shelf hardware products, covering every aspect of visuals performance, including video sample playback (Korg Kaptivator), real-time video effects (Korg Entrancer), scratchable DVD players (Pioneer DVJ-X1 and Pioneer DVJ-1000) and 3D visual generation (Edirol CG8).

[edit] Software
The evolution of computers has allowed for VJ-specific programs to be produced and has allowed for easier accessibility to the art form.
Improvements in beat detection and audio segmentation algorithms have made it possible to produce automated and semi-automated VJ programs, such as Noise Cradle. Such software usually supports user imported images, videos and live video feeds.
Modul8 is a software designed for vjs and live performers. They also organize the "Mapping" VJ and Audiovisual Festival in Geneva, Switzerland. The festival supports the developing areas of vj culture, real time media and performing arts as well as organizing educational workshops, lectures and conferences.
MXWendler is a professional VJ software made in Germany. It is used in Clubs and Theatres.
One of the most popular commercial VJ programs is Resolume Avenue, now in beta release for version 3.
ArKaos is an increasingly popular VJ program.
MooNSTER was one of the first VJ programs for Windows, permitting the edition in real time of videos / 3d objects / 2d effects on low end computers. It is no longer maintained and is available for free.
tokyo motion dive is another somewhat obsolete software which comes with an edirol controller.
Flxer is a freeware alternative which runs on Adobe Flash, so it compatible with any OS that can support Flash.

[edit] VJ events
In recent years VJing's popularity has allowed for more Visual Art specific events to be organised.
AVIT [1] is one of the largest VJ events, held approximately once a year in the UK, Germany and North America. There have also been smaller events held in Latin America, along with an AVIT Retreat in Colorado. AVIT's objectives are:

To increase public participation in VJing
To facilitate the development and skills base of existing VJ's
To raise the profile of live video performance as an art form
To capitalise on the networked community of VJCentral.com or FullScreenMusic.com

CLUB TRANSMEDIALE - [Festival for adventurous music and related visual arts] started in 1999, Berlin, Germany
CIMATICS - Brussels International Festival for Live Audiovisual Art & VJing, started in 2003, focuses on live audiovisual performance and VJing.
