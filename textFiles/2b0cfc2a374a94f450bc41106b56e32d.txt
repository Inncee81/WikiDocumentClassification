[edit] Early beginnings: a pared-down browser




Phoenix 0.1, the first official release






Firefox 1.0, the first release targeted for general public


Hyatt and Ross' browser was created to combat the perceived software bloat of the Mozilla Suite (codenamed, internally referred to, and continued by the community as SeaMonkey), which integrated features such as IRC, mail and news, and WYSIWYG HTML editing into one software suite.
Firefox retains the cross-platform nature of the original Mozilla browser, using the XUL user interface markup language. The use of XUL makes it possible to extend the browser's capabilities through the use of extensions and themes. The development and installation processes of these add-ons raised security concerns, and with the release of Firefox 0.9, the Mozilla Foundation opened a Mozilla Update website containing "approved" themes and extensions. The use of XUL sets Firefox apart from other browsers, including other projects based on Mozilla's Gecko layout engine and most other browsers, which use interfaces native to their respective platforms (Galeon and Epiphany use GTK+; K-Meleon uses MFC; and Camino uses Cocoa). Many of these projects were started before Firefox, and probably served as inspiration.
Although the Mozilla Foundation had intended to make the Mozilla Suite obsolete and to replace it with Firefox, the Foundation continued to maintain the suite until April 12, 2006[1] because it had many corporate users, as well as being bundled with other software. The Mozilla community (as opposed to the Foundation) continues to release new versions of the suite using the product name SeaMonkey to avoid any possible confusion with the original Mozilla Suite.
On February 5, 2004 the business and IT consulting company AMS categorized Mozilla Firefox (then Firebird) as a "Tier 1" (meaning "Best of Breed") open source product [2]. This meant that AMS considered Firebird (as it was called at the time) to be virtually risk-free and technically strong.

[edit] Naming
The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). When sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.
The Phoenix name was retained until April 14, 2003 when it was changed (after a short stint as Phoenix Browser) due to trademark issues with the BIOS manufacturer, Phoenix Technologies (who produce a BIOS-based browser called Phoenix FirstWare Connect). The new name, Firebird, was met with mixed reactions, particularly as the Firebird database server already carried the name. In late April, following an apparent name change to Firebird browser for a few hours, the Mozilla Foundation issued an official statement which stated that the browser should be referred to as Mozilla Firebird (as opposed to just Firebird). Continuing pressure from the Firebird community forced another change, and on February 9, 2004 the project was renamed Mozilla Firefox (or Firefox for short).
The name, "Firefox", was chosen for its similarity to "Firebird", but also for its uniqueness in the computing industry. To ensure that no further name changes would be necessary, the Mozilla Foundation began the process of registering Firefox[3] as a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in December 2003. This trademark process led to a delay of several months in the release of Firefox 0.8 when the foundation discovered that in the UK Firefox had already been registered[4] as a trademark for software by The Charlton Company.[5] The situation was resolved when the foundation was given a license to use Charlton's European trademark. The repeated renaming of the program prompted the development of the tongue-in-cheek extension "Firesomething", which allowed users to randomize the name on startup, giving it such satirical soubriquets as "Firegiraffe" or "Moonbadger".

[edit] Branding and visual identity




Various logos used during the development of Firefox


One of the most visible enhancements is the new visual identity of Firefox and Thunderbird. It has often been argued that free software is typically designed only by programmers — rather than graphic designers or usability gurus — and that it frequently suffers from poor icon and GUI design and lacks a strong visual identity. The early Firebird and Phoenix releases of Firefox were considered to have had reasonable visual designs, but were not up to the same standard as many professionally released software packages.
In October 2003, professional interface designer, Steven Garrity, wrote an article covering everything he considered to be wrong with Mozilla's visual identity.[6] The page received a great deal of attention (it was slashdotted). The majority of the criticisms levelled at the article were along the lines of "where's the patch?".
Shortly afterwards, Garrity was invited by the Mozilla Foundation to head up the new visual identity team. The release of Firefox 0.8 in February 2004 saw the introduction of the new branding efforts, including new icons designed by silverorange, a group of web developers with a long-standing relationship with Mozilla, with final renderings by Jon Hicks, who had previously worked on Camino.[7][8] The logo was revised and updated later, fixing some flaws found when the logo was enlarged.[9]


Blue globe artwork is distributed with Firefox source code, and is explicitly not protected as a trademark[10]


The animal shown in the logo is a stylized fox, although "firefox" is considered to be a common name for the Red Panda. The panda, according to Hicks, "didn't really conjure up the right imagery", besides not being widely known.[8] The logo was chosen for the purpose of making an impression, while not shouting out with overdone artwork. The logo had to stand out in the user's mind, be easy for others to remember and stand out while not causing too much distraction when among other icons. It was expected to be the final logo for the product.
The Firefox icon is a trademark used to designate the official Mozilla build of the Firefox software, and builds of official distribution partners.[11] Although the core software is open source, the artwork (along with the quality feedback agent and parts of the installer) is not freely licensed without official permission from the developers. For this reason, Debian and other software distributors who distribute patched or modified versions of Firefox do not use the icon.

[edit] Delicious delicacies




A screenshot showing the "cookies are delicious delicacies" line.


Early Firefox releases featured a preferences panel that described cookies by stating "Cookies are delicious delicacies".
The phrase was representative of the programmers' quirky sense of humor and a general reflection of the free software movement's unconventional approach. The phrase became something of a cult legend and was even featured in an O'Reilly computer book.
The original text was inserted by Blake Ross, one of the lead developers of Firefox, because, he says, "describing something so complicated in such a small space was quite frankly the last thing I wanted to worry about after rewriting the cookie manager".
However, in reflection of the growing acceptance and use of the Firefox browser in the Internet mainstream, the text was later changed. It was considered a bug and was "fixed" by Mike Connor to read "Cookies are pieces of information stored by web pages on your computer. They are used to remember login information and other data". The revision was regarded as more likely to be helpful for the less technically oriented computer users who were now using Firefox—representing Mozilla's desire to appeal to mainstream users.
After this happened, the following remarks were made by Blake Ross over IRC to Mike Connor:

   <blake2> congratulations mconnor 
   <blake2> you just destroyed a legend! 

The text became a popular in-joke and on August 2004, the Delicious Delicacies extension, which is no longer maintained and updated, was released by Jesse Ruderman. This extension restored the old description of cookies, available in several languages.
As of Firefox 2.0, cookies no longer have a description in the preferences window.

[edit] Version 1.5




"Deer Park", the codename of the Firefox 1.1 and 1.5 Alphas, did not include Firefox branding.


On June 23, 2005, the Mozilla Foundation announced that Firefox 1.1 (which became Firefox 1.5) and other new Mozilla products will no longer support Mac OS X v10.1. This is intended to improve the quality of Firefox releases on Mac OS X v10.2 and above. Users of 10.1 could still use Firefox versions from the 1.0.x branch (e.g. Firefox 1.0.7).




Updated options window introduced in Firefox 1.5


Firefox 1.5 was released on November 30, 2005. The original plan was for a Firefox 1.1 and later a Firefox 1.5. After the first two 1.1 alpha builds, the Mozilla Foundation abandoned the 1.1 release plan and merged it with the planned feature set of 1.5 instead, with 1.5 being released later than was planned for 1.1. The new version resynchronised the code-base of the release builds (as opposed to nightly builds) with the core "trunk" which contained additional features not available in 1.0, as it branched from the trunk around the 0.9 release. As such, there was a backlog of bug fixes between 0.9 and the release of 1.0, which were made available in 1.5. Version 1.5 implemented a new Mac-like options interface, which was the subject of much criticism from Windows and Linux users, with a "Sanitize" action to allow a person to clear their privacy related information without manually clicking the "Clear All" button. In Firefox 1.5, a user can clear all privacy-related settings simply by exiting the browser or using a keyboard shortcut, depending on their settings. Moreover, the software update system was improved (with binary patches now possible). There were also improvements in the extension management system, with a number of new developer features.
Also, Firefox 1.5 had (partial) SVG 1.1 support, as shown in Mozilla's Bugzilla database. This unplanned movement may have been due to the release of Opera 8.0 on April 19, 2005, which supported SVG Tiny.
Alpha builds of Firefox 1.5 (1.1a1 and 1.1a2) did not contain Firefox branding. They were labeled "Deer Park" (which was Firefox 1.5's internal codename) and contained a different program icon. This was done to dissuade end-users from downloading preview versions, which are intended for developers only.
Firefox 1.5.0.12 is the final version supported on Windows 95.

[edit] Version 2
Main article: Mozilla Firefox 2




Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.12 running on Ubuntu


On March 22, 2006, the first alpha version of Firefox 2 (Bon Echo Alpha 1) was released. It featured Gecko 1.8.1 for the first time.
Firefox 2 was released on October 24, 2006 and contained many new features not found in Firefox 1.5, including improved support for SVG and JavaScript 1.7, as well as UI changes.
Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.x is the final version supported on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98. Mozilla Corporation has announced that it will not develop new versions of Firefox 2 after the Firefox 2.0.0.20 release. They will however continue development of Firefox 2 as long as other programs, like the Thunderbird mail client, are depending on it. The current internal release is 2.0.0.22.

[edit] Firefox Live Chat
In December 2007, Firefox Live Chat was launched. It allows users to ask volunteers questions through a system powered by Jive Software, with guaranteed hours of operation and the possibility of help after hours.[12]

[edit] Version 3.0
Main article: Mozilla Firefox 3




Mozilla Firefox 3.0 on Ubuntu


The Mozilla Foundation released Firefox 3 on June 17, 2008. The first Firefox 3 beta (under codename 'Gran Paradiso'.[13] ) had been released several months earlier on 19 November 2007[14], which was followed by several more beta releases in the Spring of 2008 culminating in the June release.[15]
One of the major changes in Firefox 3 is the implementation of Gecko 1.9, an updated layout engine. The new version fixes many bugs and implements new web APIs.[16]

[edit] Version 3.5
Version 3.1 Beta 2 was launched on December 8, 2008, adding new video support and a private browsing feature and enhancing the speed of some JavaScript computations. Another beta is planned which has been delayed several times due to some showstoppers. The new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine is turned on by default which is slated to be the fastest JavaScript engine. In several benchmarks, TraceMonkey is 1.2x faster than Chrome's V8 and 5x to 20x faster than other browsers' engines. The new tab switching behavior has been removed because of user feedbacks. Firefox 3.1 beta 3 was released on March 12, 2009.
Mozilla developers have decided to change the numbering of this release to version 3.5, to reflect a significantly greater scope of changes than was originally planned. The first release to reflect this change will be Firefox 3.5 Beta 4.

[edit] Version 3.6
The release following Firefox 3.1 (since changed to Firefox 3.5) was originally referred to as 3.2. Since the change, Mozilla developer Mike Shaver has indicated that the release number will be referred to as 3.6 ad interim.[17] The codename for this version has been set to Namoroka.[18] The release date is not yet known. Development started on 1 December 2008.[19] This release will use the Gecko 1.9.2 engine on the Mozilla 2 platform and include several interface improvements, such as new graphical tab-switching behavior, which was removed from 3.1 Beta 2.

[edit] Future development
The precursory releases of upcoming Firefox releases are codenamed "Minefield", as this is the name of the trunk builds. Development of Firefox after version 3.0 is split over two milestones: version 3.1 and version 4.0. Firefox 3.0, formerly in the development stage, was released to the general public on June 17, 2008.[20] Development for the 3.5 releases takes place on the Mozilla trunk, with releases and pre-release nightly builds coming from the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch (2.0) and the Mozilla 1.9 branch (3.0). Development for 4.0 will be based on Mozilla 2. Mitchell Baker, Mozilla's former Chief Executive Officer, had mentioned some possible future features of Firefox in an interview for APC Magazine. These features included open-source, in-browser video playback, offline application support, and a version of Firefox for mobile phones.[21]

Three Kings, Royal Oak, One Tree Hill, Mission Bay, and Greenlane are all suburbs in Auckland, New Zealand; Whangamata is a small seaside town in the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand. The codenames were chosen from these suburb names by Ben Goodger, who grew up in Auckland. The other codenames included in the Firefox roadmap are derived from an actual roadmap of a journey through California to Phoenix, Arizona. Gran Paradiso is an Italian mountain.
According to Ben Goodger, "Deer Park is not Deer Park, Victoria, but just a symbolic name: "I was riding LIRR a few weeks ago and saw the name go by and I thought it sounded nice". Therefore, this is likely a reference to Deer Park, New York, a CDP on Long Island.
