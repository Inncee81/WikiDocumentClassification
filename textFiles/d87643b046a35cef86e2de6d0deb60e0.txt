if (wgNotice != '') document.writeln(wgNotice); Convex uniform honeycomb

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
In geometry, a convex uniform honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation in three-dimensional Euclidean space with non-overlapping convex uniform polyhedral cells.
Twenty-eight such honeycombs exist:

the familiar cubic honeycomb and 7 truncations thereof;
the alternated cubic honeycomb and 4 truncations thereof;
10 prismatic forms based on the uniform plane tilings (11 if including the cubic honeycomb);
5 modifications of some of the above by elongation and/or gyration.

They can be considered the three-dimensional analogue to the uniform tilings of the plane.

[edit] History

1900: Thorold Gosset enumerated the list of semiregular convex polytopes with regular cells (Platonic solids) in his publication On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions, including one regular cubic honeycomb, and two semiregular forms with tetrahedra and octahedra.
1905: Alfredo Andreini enumerated 25 of these tessellations.
1991: Norman Johnson's manuscript Uniform Polytopes identified the complete list of 28.
1994: Branko Grünbaum, in his paper Uniform tilings of 3-space, also independently enumerated all 28, after discovering errors in Andreini's publication. He found the 1905 paper, which listed 25, had 1 wrong, and 4 being missing. Grünbaum also states that I. Alexeyev of Russia also independently enumerated these forms around the same time.
2006: George Olshevsky, in his manuscript Uniform Panoploid Tetracombs, along with repeating the derived list of 11 convex uniform tilings, and 28 convex uniform honeycombs, expands a further derived list of 143 convex uniform tetracombs (Honeycombs of uniform polychorons in 4-space).

Only 14 of the convex uniform polyhedra appear in these patterns:

three of the five Platonic solids,
six of the thirteen Archimedean solids, and
five of the infinite family of prisms.


[edit] Names
This set can be called the regular and semiregular honeycombs. It has been called the Archimedean honeycombs by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, commonly called Archimedean solids. Recently Conway has suggested naming the set as the Architectonic tessellations and the dual honeycombs as the Catoptric tessellations.
The individual honeycombs are listed with names given to them by Norman Johnson. (Some of the terms used below are defined in Uniform polychoron#Geometric derivations.)
For cross-referencing, they are given with list indices from [A]ndreini (1-22), [W]illiams(1-2,9-19), [J]ohnson (11-19, 21-25, 31-34, 41-49, 51-52, 61-65), and [G]runbaum(1-28).

[edit] Compact Euclidean uniform tessellations (by their infinite Coxeter group families)




Fundamental domains in a cubic element of three groups.


The fundamental infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:

The C~3, [4,3,4], cubic,  (8 unique forms plus one alternation)
The B~3, [4,31,1], alternated cubic,  (11 forms, 3 new)
The A~3 cyclic group,  (5 forms, one new)

In addition there are 5 special honeycombs which don't have pure reflectional symmetry and are constructed from reflectional forms with elongation and gyration operations.
The total unique honeycombs above are 18.
The prismatic stacks from infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:

The C~2xI~1, [4,4]x[∞] prismatic group,  (2 new forms)
The H~2xI~1, [6,3]x[∞] prismatic group,  (7 unique forms)
The A~2xI~1, [Δ]x[∞] prismatic group,  (No new forms)
The I~1xI~1xI~1, [∞]x[∞]x[∞] prismatic group,  (These all become a cubic honeycomb)

In addition there is one special elongated form of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.
The total unique prismatic honeycombs above (excluding the cubic counted previously) are 10.
Combining these counts, 18 and 10 gives us the total 28 uniform honeycombs.

[edit] The C~3, [4,3,4] group (cubic)
The regular cubic honeycomb, represented by Schläfli symbol {4,3,4}, offers seven unique derived uniform honeycombs via truncation operations. (One redundant form, the runcinated cubic honeycomb, is included for completeness though identical to the cubic honeycomb.)

[edit] B~4, h[4,3,4], [4,31,1] group
The B~4 group offers 11 derived forms via truncation operations, four being unique uniform honeycombs.
The honeycombs from this group are called alternated cubic because the first form can be seen as a cubic honeycomb with alternate vertices removed, reducing cubic cells to tetrahedra and creating octahedron cells in the gaps.
Nodes are indexed left to right as 0,1,0',3 with 0' being below and interchangeable with 0. The alternate cubic names given are based on this ordering.

[edit] Nonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated)
Three more uniform honeycombs are generated by breaking one or another of the above honeycombs where its faces form a continuous plane, then rotating alternate layers by 60 or 90 degrees (gyration) and/or inserting a layer of prisms (elongation).
The elongated and gyroelongated alternated cubic tilings have the same vertex figure, but are not alike. In the elongated form, each prism meets a tetrahedron at one triangular end and an octahedron at the other. In the gyroelongated form, prisms that meet tetrahedra at both ends alternate with prisms that meet octahedra at both ends.
The gyroelongated triangular prismatic tiling has the same vertex figure as one of the plain prismatic tilings; the two may be derived from the gyrated and plain triangular prismatic tilings, respectively, by inserting layers of cubes.

[edit] Prismatic stacks
Eleven prismatic tilings are obtained by stacking the eleven uniform plane tilings, shown below, in parallel layers. (One of these honeycombs is the cubic, shown above.) The vertex figure of each is an irregular bipyramid whose faces are isosceles triangles.

[edit] The C~2xI~1(∞), [4,4] x [∞], prismatic group
There's only 3 unique honeycombs from the square tiling, but all 6 tiling truncations are listed below for completeness, and tiling images are shown by colors corresponding to each form.

[edit] Examples
All 28 of these tessellations are found in crystal arrangements.[citation needed]
The alternated cubic honeycomb is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic close-packing of spheres. The space-filling truss of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by Alexander Graham Bell and independently re-discovered by Buckminster Fuller (who called it the octet truss and patented it in the 1940s). [2] [3] [4] [5]. Octet trusses are now among the most common types of truss used in construction.

[edit] Noncompact forms
If cells are allowed to be uniform tilings, more uniform honeycombs can be defined:
Families:

C~2xA1: [4,4]x[ ]  Cubic prismatic slab honeycomb (3 forms)
H~2xA1: [6,3]x[ ]  Tri-hexagonal prismatic slab honeycomb (8 forms)
A~2xA1: [Δ]x[ ]  triangular prismatic slab (No new forms)
I~1xA1xA1: [∞]x[ ]x[ ]  =  Cubic column honeycomb (1 form)
I2(p)xI~1: [p]x[∞]  Prismatic column honeycomb
I~1xI~1xA1: [∞]x[∞]x[ ] = [4,4]x[ ] -  =  (Same as cubic slab honeycomb family)


Examples (partially drawn): Cubic slab honeycomb and Alternated hexagonal slab honeycomb.

[edit] Hyperbolic forms
There are 9 Coxeter group families of compact uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic 3-space, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by ring permutations of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams for each family.
From these 9 families, there are a total of 76 unique honeycombs generated:

[3,5,3] : 
[5,3,4] : 
[5,3,5] : 
[5,31,1] : 
[4,3,3,3:] : 
[4,3,4,3:] : 
[5,3,3,3:] : 
[5,3,4,3:] : 
[5,3,5,3:] : 

The full list of hyperbolic uniform honeycombs has not been proven and an unknown number of non-wythoffian exist. One known example is given with the {3,5,3} family below.

[edit] [3,5,3] family
There are 9 forms, generated by ring permutations of the Coxeter group: [3,5,3] or 
One related non-wythoffian form is constructed from the {3,5,3} vertex figure with 4 (tetrahedrally arranged) vertices removed, creating pentagonal antiprisms and dodecahedra filling in the gaps.[1]
