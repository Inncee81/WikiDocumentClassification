A wiki farm allows users to create individual wikis. When multiple individual wikis run off of one installation of wiki programming, this is a wiki farm. This does not include cases where the spaces (or, groups of pages) within a single wiki instance are dedicated for specific topics. Wiki farms are run from a server or an array of servers in which core wiki code is installed.[clarification needed]
Prior to Wiki Farms, the administrator of multiple wikis had to install each wiki independently. This resulted in much wasted time, deploying redundant code and configurations on the server. With wiki farms this process is greatly simplified. The administrator established unique space on the server(s) (the field) and uses the core installed code (in the farm) to execute the functions of each individual wiki. This development may also be used by a number of publicly-available wiki hosting services, as evidenced by the tendency of these services to, not only classify themselves as "wiki farms", but to define the entire concept as solely within the domain of a hosting for multiple wikis. Before these public services were available, users who wanted to share information on-line through their own Wiki had to install a Wiki server of their own, configure it, connect it to the Internet and maintain it. Today, the public services have eliminated this requirement.[original research?]
Both Non-commercial and commercial Wiki farms are available for users and online communities. While most of the wiki farms allow anyone to open their own Wiki, some impose restrictions. Many wiki farm companies generate revenue through the insertion of advertisements, but often allow payment of a monthly fee as an alternative to accepting ads.

[edit] General
The following tables compare general information for several wiki farms; however, more than 100 wiki farms have been created.[1] Further information can be found at the websites themselves, or in the linked article for some of the more notable ones. This article is not all-inclusive or necessarily up to date. It does not review or endorse any wiki farm, nor does it include any advertising hyperbole. See the external links at the end for more info, reviews, forums, etc.. The Alexa traffic rankings are not accurate for those wiki farms that allow some of their hosted wikis to have separate domain names. In those cases there may be some additional Alexa rankings listed below for some of the larger individual wikis in a wiki farm. The Wikis are normally provided with a standard layout, or a choice of layouts, usually known as skins. Some wiki farms allow the layout to be customised using cascading style sheets (css).

Wikia
No
Wiki hosting service created in 2004, formerly known as Wikicities. All wikis have common login and preferences. Single sign-on to multiple projects. Database download available. Creation of a wiki is subject to approval; must have a large potential audience and be likely to attract enough editors. Projects which overlap existing Wikia or Wikimedia are not accepted. No means to close an inactive wiki, even if the community has moved elsewhere. Wikia domains, names, and identifiers owned by Wikia Inc, not the respective communities; in a recent change of policies, all communities are being migrated to .wikia.com subdomains. There is also a "Scratchpad" wiki subdivided into categories, which welcomes all content.
