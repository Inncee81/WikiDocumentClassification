eGroupWare is a free open source groupware software intended for businesses from small to enterprises. Its primary functions allow users to manage contacts, appointments, projects and to-do lists.
It is used either via its native web-interface, making access platform-independent, or by using different supported groupware clients, such as Kontact, Novell Evolution, or Microsoft Outlook. It can also be used by mobile phone or PDA via SyncML.
It currently has translations for more than 25 languages, including rtl support. It depends on a standard X-AMP System and as such requires no specific operating system. Most popular internet browsers are supported for use as web based clients.

[edit] History
eGroupWare is the most current manifestation of a chain of projects. The original project was called webdistro. In 2000 development on the project phpgroupware began, which was based on webdistro; and in 2003 the egroupware fork was born. eGroupware has a very pronounced community character compared with its predecessors.
There is a egroupware constitution, adopted in 2005, which guarantees freedom and security to the community and establishes admin elections[1].
