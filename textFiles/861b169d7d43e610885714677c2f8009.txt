List of notable occultists and mystics.
This is a list of notable people, whether contemporary, historical or legendary, who are or were involved in any of the following practices and traditions:

occult science
paranormal magic, 'black' or 'white'
witchcraft
sorcery
wizardry
astrology
alchemy
practical mysticism
West African Vodun, Haitian Vodou, or Louisiana Voodoo
divination and fortune-telling
theurgy

Since this subject has attracted hoaxes, folklore, and tall tales, the inclusion of historical persons is limited based on considerations of accepted historical fact - a restriction which obviously does not apply to legendary or mythological figures.
For a list of sleight of hand artists and practitioners of stage magic, see: List of magicians.
