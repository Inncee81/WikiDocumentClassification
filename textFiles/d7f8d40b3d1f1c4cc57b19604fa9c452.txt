Santa Cruz 4/20 celebration at Porter Meadow on UCSC campus in 2007


4:20 or 4/20 (pronounced four-twenty) refers to consumption of cannabis and, by extension, a way to identify oneself with cannabis drug subculture.

Origins and observances





This article or section is missing information about: The "many explanations for the origin of the term" should each be cited in regard to how notable they are.
This concern has been noted on the talk page where it may be discussed whether or not to include such information. (November 2008)






Statue of Louis Pasteur, at San Rafael High School.


One explanation of the origin of the term stems from a story about a group of teenagers at San Rafael High School in San Rafael, California, United States in 1971. The teens would meet after school at 4:20 p.m. to smoke marijuana at the Louis Pasteur statue. The exact time was chosen because that was the time that afternoon detention was dismissed. By extension April 20 ("4/20" in U.S. date notation) has evolved into a counterculture holiday, where people gather to celebrate and consume cannabis.[1] In some locations this celebration coincides with Earth Week.[2][3][4] In Dunedin, New Zealand, students at the University of Otago and other cannabis law reform activists meet under a walnut tree on the Otago University Union Lawn on Wednesdays and Fridays at 4:20pm to openly smoke cannabis in public in what they consider an act of protest.[5][6][7] In 2008 members of the Dunedin group were arrested and issued trespass notices in relation to openly smoking cannabis on the Otago University Union Lawn[8], but the meetings continue to this day.
