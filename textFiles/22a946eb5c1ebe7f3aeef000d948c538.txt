From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
An auditory illusion is an illusion of hearing, the aural equivalent of an optical illusion: the listener hears either sounds which are not present in the stimulus, or "impossible" sounds. In short, audio illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic, makeshift tools, differ from perfect audio receptors (for better or for worse).
Examples of auditory illusions:

the Shepard tone or scale, and the Deutsch tritone paradox
hearing a missing fundamental frequency, given other parts of the harmonic series
Various psychoacoustic tricks of lossy Audio compression
Octave illusion/Deutsch's High-Low Illusion
Deutsch's scale illusion
Glissando illusion
Illusory continuity of tones
McGurk effect
