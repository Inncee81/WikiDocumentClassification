Collaborative intelligence is a measure of the collaborative ability of a group or entity. According to Stephen James Joyce author of Teaching an Anthill to Fetch – Developing Collaborative Intelligence @ Work, "collaborative intelligence (CQ) is the ability to create, contribute to and harness the power within networks of people and relationships". Knowledge derived from collaborative efforts is increasing proportionally to the reach of the world wide web, collaborative groupware like Skype, NetMeeting, WebEx, iPeerAdvisory and many others.
IQ is a term readily used to describe or measure an intelligent quota of a person. EQ has been used to measure the Emotional Intelligence of a person to describe how a person handles emotions in a given situation. CQ or Collaborative Intelligence measures the collaborative ability of a group. CQ is a fairly new term arising from the visibility of collaborative efforts of companies and entities[citation needed].
CQ is a situation where the knowledge and problem solving capability of a group is much greater than the knowledge possessed by an individual group member. As groups work together they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings. The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members.
Distributed collaborative intelligence is the act of a group collaborating within a virtual sphere of interaction. Group members can interact in real time or asynchronously even though they are not located within the same physical space. Technologies used to enhance distributed collaborative intelligence and to facilitate group problem solving are:

Messaging


Synchronous conferencing technologies like instant messaging, online chat and shared white boards.
Asynchronous messaging like electronic mail, threaded, moderated discussion forums and web logs.


Stigmergy


Wiki
Social evolutionary computation

The ability of a group to solve a problem collectively is potentially directly proportional to the number of members in a group; however effective architecture of interaction is needed to achieve this.
Critical success factors for a high collaborative intelligence quotient are:

Group moderation and facilitation
Adherence to a small set of fundamental rules relate to member interaction
No limits to thinking; or the promotion of creative thinking
Strong group membership feedback
Quality control. Ideas need to be nurtured, but the solutions should be upheld after a critical peer review.
The construction of a deeply documented group memory or knowledge base
