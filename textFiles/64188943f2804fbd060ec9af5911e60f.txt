This page is intended to be a list of computers in fiction and science fiction.
See the List of fictional robots and androids for all fictional computers which are described as existing in a mobile or humanlike form.
Computers have often been used as fictional objects in literature, movies and in other forms of media. Fictional computers tend to be considerably more sophisticated than anything yet devised in the real world.
