Colletto Fava is a 5,000 feet (1,500 m) high hill in the northern Piedmont region of Italy. In 2005, Members of the Viennese art group Gelitin finished erecting a massive, pink, stuffed rabbit on the side of the mountain. The final piece is 200 feet (about 60 meters) in length and 20 feet (6 meters) high on its sides. The group not only expect people to observe the art work, but also for hikers to climb it and relax on the top. The work will remain at Colletto Fava until 2025.
The work, titled Hase (German for "hare"), first opened on September 18, 2005, at 11:30 am and is expected to last until 2025.
"We foresee that in twenty years the pink puppet (made of straw-stuffed fabric) will be swallowed by the weather, devoured by cattle, completely erased by the weather and nature" said Gelitin in an interview.
