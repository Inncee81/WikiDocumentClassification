[edit] Overview
Hosted by a human character named DJ Lance Rock, the series features a mix of live-action segments featuring cartoonish costumed characters--Muno (the red cyclops), Foofa (the pink flower bubble), Brobee (a little green monster), Toodee (the blue cat-dragon) and Plex (the yellow robot)--and many short animated sketches and musical numbers.[4]
In its first season, the show featured a wide variety of guests, including Jack Black, Leslie Hall, The Shins, The Aggrolites, Cornelius, Biz Markie, Shiny Toy Guns, Supernova, Mark Mothersbaugh, Rahzel, The Postmarks, Sugarland, Tony Hawk, Low, Laila Ali, Elijah Wood, Mýa, The Salteens and series co-creator Jacobs' band, The Aquabats. In the second season bands like Enon, The Clientele, Joy Zipper, Of Montreal were featured.
Among the varied animation sequences during the show is Super Martian Robot Girl, designed by indie cartoonists Evan Dorkin and Sarah Dyer.[5]
The show also featured regular use of chiptunes and visuals reminiscent of retro video games and TV shows.
MP3 demos were available from an official Yo Gabba Gabba site as early as June 2006, before a network had picked up the show.
The world premiere live concert tour of Yo Gabba Gabba will take place in Australia in May 2009. DJ Lance Rock, Muno, Foofa, Brobee, Toodee and Plex will be performing in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney with an "indy" house-band and secret, special guests at each show. The concerts are being produced by Australian promoter, Entertainment Store Group.
