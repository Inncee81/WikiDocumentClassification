Crystal Clear is a member of the Crystal family of methodologies as described by Alistair Cockburn and is considered an example of an agile or lightweight methodology.
Crystal Clear can be applied to teams of up to 6 or 8 colocated developers working on systems that are not life-critical. The Crystal family of methodologies focus on efficiency and habitability as components of project safety.
Crystal Clear focuses on people, not processes or artifacts.
Crystal Clear contains the following properties (the first three are required):

Frequent Delivery of Usable Code to Users (required)
Reflective Improvement (required)
Osmotic Communication Preferably by Being Co-Located (required)
Personal Safety
Focus
Easy Access to Expert Users
Automated Tests, Configuration Management, and Frequent Integration
