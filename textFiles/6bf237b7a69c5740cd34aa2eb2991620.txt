Mirtazapine is an antidepressant introduced by Organon International in 1994 used for the treatment of moderate to severe depression. Mirtazapine has a tetracyclic chemical structure and is classified as a Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). Mirtazapine and maprotiline are the only tetracyclic antidepressants that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat depression. Because of its unique structure, mirtazapine has fewer anticholinergic effects, serotonin-related side effects[1] and adrenergic side effects (such as orthostatic hypotension and sexual dysfunction) compared to other antidepressants. Antihistaminic side effects of drowsiness and weight gain are prominent. It is most useful as an add-on medication to enhance the effectiveness of agents such as duloxetine, bupropion and venlafaxine in severe and treatment-resistant depression. Mirtazapine is relatively safe if an overdose is taken.[2]

[edit] Indications

[edit] Approved use
Mirtazapine is primarily used to treat the symptoms of moderate to severe depression.[3]

[edit] Unapproved and off-label use
There is evidence that mirtazapine can be used to treat insomnia, panic disorder (PD),[4] generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),[5] obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),[6] post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)[7] sleep apnea,[8] and pruritus.[9] It can also be used to offset the gastro-intestinal side effects of SSRIs [10].
Mirtazapine has been reported to be effective in the prophylactic treatment of chronic tension headache.[11] Due to the common side effect of weight gain, it may also be beneficial to patients who are underweight or have reduced appetite.
There is some evidence that mirtazapine may have a beneficial effect in Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) by reducing JC virus proliferation. It is being used now (2008) cautiously in immunosuppressed PML patients to evaluate its efficacy.
Due to its anti-emetic properties via 5HT-3 receptor antagonism, mirtazapine is helpful in the treatment of many nausea and emesis-enducing conditions. Mirtazapine has proven helpful in treating the digestive disorder gastroparesis, [12] chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,[13] [14] vomiting following gastric bypass surgery, [15] and hyperemesis gravidarum. [16]

[edit] Veterinary use
Mirtazapine is used off-label as an appetite stimulant in dogs and cats. Cats are often only given this medication once every three days, which can be convenient for owners.
Anecdotal evidence also suggests that mirtazapine may be effective in treating certain vomiting or anorexia-related conditions in dogs and cats. Any such use is still off-label, however.[17]

[edit] Mechanism of action
It is thought to work by blocking presynaptic Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors that normally inhibit the release of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and serotonin, thereby increasing active levels in the synapse. Mirtazapine is a potent antagonist of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.

[edit] Side effects
Interestingly, its side-effect profile can be used for benefit in certain clinical situations. The drowsiness, increased appetite, and weight gain that it causes are useful in patients with depressive disorders with prominent sleep and appetite disturbances.
In addition, it can be used in patients who suffer from nausea, since it is a 5HT-3 antagonist, the target of the popular anti-emetic ondansetron (Zofran).
At lower doses, mirtazapine is primarily antihistaminergic, causing sedation, which can be beneficial in depressed patients who have difficulty falling asleep. Higher doses are generally less sedating as its antihistaminergic properties are thought to be offset by increased noradrenaline release.[18]

[edit] Side effects occurring commonly

Drowsiness, especially at lower doses and during the first few weeks of treatment
Vivid dreams / Nightmares as a result of regular intake
Increased appetite
Weight gain
Increase in cholesterol, independent of weight gain
Dizziness, coupled often with the effects of sickness
Headache
Dry mouth


[edit] Side effects occurring rarely

Excessive urinating when taken with alcohol
Mania
Seizures
Tremor
Muscle twitching and Restless Legs Syndrome[1][2]
Pins and needles
Rash and skin eruptions
Pain in the joints or muscles
Low blood pressure
Higher blood pressure
Obesity
Mild visual hallucinations (when taken during the day or when awake)
Depersonalization / Derealization (i.e. feeling unreal, in a dream-like state)
Oedema (swollen ankles or feet)


[edit] Dangerous side effects
Any of these side effects requires urgent medical attention. Medical advice is also required for taper-off instructions: sudden withdrawal from antidepressants can cause serious symptoms. However, sudden withdrawal can be used, under appropriate medical supervision, when the risks of continuing the antidepressant during a 'taper-off' phase are too great.

An allergic reaction; signs of swelling of the lips, face and tongue, difficulty in breathing, rash or itching (especially affecting the whole body) or feeling faint
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes)
Agranulocytosis, a lowering of white blood cells used to fight infection in the body. Signs of infection such as fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers or stomach upset should be monitored closely. Occurs in 1/1000 patients.


[edit] Withdrawal symptoms
Antidepressants in general have some dependence producing effects, most notably a withdrawal syndrome. However, their dependence producing properties are not as significant as benzodiazepines. For example antidepressants have little to no abuse potential unlike benzodiazepines.[3] An abrupt or overrapid reduction of antidepressants including mirtazapine can cause a discontinuation or withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may also occur in the neonate.[4] As with most antidepressants, a gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended in order to minimize the discontinuation syndrome withdrawal effects.[5] Effects of sudden cessation of treatment may include:[6][7]

Anxiety and panic attacks[8]
Flu like symptoms
Gastrointestinal disturbances
Headache
Mania or hypomania[9][10]
Insomnia
Irritability
Nausea and vomiting
Restlessness
Sensory disturbances


[edit] Dosage




Mirtazapine 30mg tablets


The usual starting dose for mirtazapine is 15mg once daily, usually at bedtime (because of its sedative nature and the possibility of disturbed visual perception). Doses may be increased, following medical advice, every 1-2 weeks up to a dose of 45mg.
In psychiatric inpatients doses 60, 90 and sometimes even 120 mg are used successfully for treating treatment-resistant depression.
It may be taken with or without food. Dispersible tablets (SolTab orally disintegrating tablets) can be taken without water.

[edit] Pregnancy and lactation

Pregnancy : Sufficient data in humans is lacking. The use should be justified by the severity of the condition to be treated.
Lactation : Sufficient data in humans is also lacking. Additionally, Mirtazapine may be found in the maternal milk in significant concentrations. The use in breastfeeding women should be carefully weighed against possible risks.


[edit] Interactions with other drugs
Because of the sedative effects of Mirtazapine, excessive sedation may result when it is used with other sedating substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines.
According to official prescribing information from Organon, Mirtazapine should not be used within 14 days of the use of an MAOI because of the risk of serious effects such as hypertensive emergency and hyperthermia.
