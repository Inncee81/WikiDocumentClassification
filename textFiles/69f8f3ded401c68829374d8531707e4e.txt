From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Business objects are objects in an object-oriented computer program that represent the entities in the business domain that the program is designed to support. For example, an order entry program might have business objects to represent each orders, line items, and invoices.
Business objects are sometimes called domain objects; a domain model represents the set of domain objects and the relationships between them.
A business object often encapsulates all of the data and business behavior associated with the entity that it represents.
Business objects don't necessarily need to represent objects in an actual business, though they often do. They can represent any object related to the domain for which a developer is creating business logic. The term is used to distinguish between the objects a developer is creating or using related to the domain and all the other types of object he or she may be working with such as user interface widgets and database objects such as tables or rows.
