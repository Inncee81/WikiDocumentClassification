RPG Maker, known in Japan as RPG Tsukūru (RPGツクール ?, sometimes romanized as RPG Tkool), is the name of an expansive series of programs for the development of role-playing games (RPGs), first created by the Japanese group ASCII, then succeeded by Enterbrain. The Japanese name, Tsukūru is a pun mixing the Japanese word tsukuru (作る), which means "make" or "create", with tsūru (ツール), the Japanese transcription of the English word "tool".[1]
The RPG Maker series has been released primarily in Japan, with later versions also released in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and North America.[2]

[edit] PC versions
RPG Maker is a program that allows users to create their own role-playing games. Most versions include a tile set based map editor, (tilesets are called chipsets in pre-XP versions), a simple scripting language for scripting events, and a battle editor. All versions include initial premade tilesets, characters, and events which can be used in creating new games. An interesting feature of the PC Versions of RPG Maker programs is that a user can create new tilesets and characters, and add any new graphics he/she wants. Several sites have developed, such as GamingWorld and RPG Maker Network, dedicated to helping users share their creations.

[edit] History
According to Enterbrain, RPG Tsukūru Dante 98, released on December 17, 1992, was the first game of the RPG Maker series,[3][4] although there were a few RPG making software by ASCII preceding it. This, along with its follow-up RPG Tsukūru Dante 98 II, was made for NEC PC-9801, and games created with these programs can be played on a Windows computer with emulators called Dante for Windows and D2win, respectively.[5]
RPG Maker 95 was the first Microsoft Windows-based RPG Maker game. Despite being an early version, RPG Maker 95 has both a higher screen resolution, and higher sprite and tile resolution than the several following versions.
RPG Maker 2000 (also called RM2k) was the second release of RPG Maker for Microsoft Windows. While it is possible to do more with RM2k, it uses lower resolution sprites and tiles than RPG Maker 95. However, it does not have a noticeable limit of 'sprites'. Unlike RM95, which can only use one 'set', RM2k can use an unlimited number of sprite sheets with specific sizes for each type. The tilesets also have a similar non-limitation. However, because tiles must be entered into a database, there is a limit on tiles. This limit however is rarely a problem (normally 5000), and even when it is, an unofficial patch exists which can bump most limits much higher at the risk of potential game corruption.
RPG Maker 2003 (also referred to as RM2k3, and sometimes RM2k/3) is largely an improvement of RM2k. RM2k games can be ported to RM2k3 (but not back to RM2k, the conversion is permanent), and most resources are interchangeable. It does however feature a side-view battle system similar to the Final Fantasy games on the Super Nintendo. This was the first version made by Enterbrain, which had previously been a part of ASCII.
RPG Maker XP (also referred to as RMXP) is the first RPG Maker which can use Ruby, making it the most powerful, programming-wise. However, many normal, simplified features present in RM2k(3) have been removed. Most of these features, however, have been programmed with Ruby, and distributed online. RMXP runs at 1024x768 resolution (though games made in it run at 640x480), while offering four times the playable area of its predecessors. Additionally, it allows greater user control over sprite size (there is no specific image size regulation for sprite sheets) and other aspects of game design. This more open-ended arrangement, coupled with the inclusion of the Ruby Game Scripting System (RGSS), makes RPG Maker XP more versatile than other versions in the series, at the cost of a steeper learning curve.
RPG Maker VX (also referred to as RMVX) is the latest RPG Maker version released by Enterbrain. Its official Japanese release date was Dec. 27 2007, and official release date in America was February 29 2008. In this new maker, the interface is more user-friendly, allowing new users to create games with ease. Frames per second rate was increased to 60, allowing a higher quality of gaming. The programming language Ruby is still implemented. New editor and a new RTP are included.

[edit] Console versions
The first console RPG Maker, RPG Tsukūru Super Dante, debuted in 1995 for the Super Famicom, as a port of RPG Tsukūru Dante 98.[4] RPG Tsukūru Super Dante was later broadcast via the Super Famicom's Satellaview subunit, as BS RPG Tsukūru - Super Dante. The Satellaview was again used to distribute BS RPG Tsukūru 2 when it came out in 1996. The first official English language release was a Sony PlayStation version, simply called RPG Maker in the North American market. As of 2007, all North American versions of the console RPG Maker are published by Agetec.

[edit] Illegal distribution
Each Windows version of RPG Maker has been, in some form, distributed illegally through the internet.[6] RPG Maker 95, as well as translation patches for the Super Nintendo titles RPG Maker Super Dante and RPG Maker 2, were translated and distributed by a group called KanjiHack. In 1999 KanjiHack closed upon receiving a cease-and-desist e-mail from ASCII's lawyers. RPG Maker 95 was re-released with a more complete translation under the name "RPG Maker 95+" by a Russian programmer, under the alias of Don Miguel,[7] who later translated and released RPG Maker 2000. Later versions, RPG Maker 2003, and RPG Maker XP, were similarly translated and distributed by a programmer under the alias of RPG Advocate. RPG Advocate took the translated versions and patches off his website and later promoted the full English version of RPG Maker XP. Both of the translations that RPG Advocate made are still in circulation.[citation needed]

[edit] Legacy
As of 2005, RPG Maker games as a whole had been sold about 2 million copies worldwide.[3]
Also, RPG Maker has been used in studies involving students learning mathematics[8] and programming[9] through the creation of role-playing games.
