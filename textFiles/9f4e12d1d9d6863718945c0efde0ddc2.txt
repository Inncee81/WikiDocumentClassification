Celtx [ˈkɛltɨks] is free media pre-production software designed for creating and organizing media projects like screenplays, films, videos, stageplays, audio plays, documentaries, machinima, comics, games and podcasts. [1]
The client-server application gives independent filmmakers and media creators an integrated and non-linear approach to the pre-production work phase, providing support for industry standard scriptwriting[2], story development, storyboarding, script breakdowns, production scheduling and reports. It allows you to attach image, video, and audio files to a project, and provides features for collaborating with others online.[3]
Celtx is built on open, non-proprietary standards (ie. HTML, XML, RDF and TXT ) It is licensed under the Celtx Public License, which is the Mozilla Public License with an attribution provision. Feature development and language translations (23+) of the application are driven largely by the feedback and volunteer efforts of members of the international Celtx community. [4].
Celtx is an acronym for Crew, Equipment, Location, Talent and XML.

[edit] Features
Celtx offers several features to screenwriters and anyone involved in pre-production.

[edit] Screenwriting
Celtx features an industry standard screenwriting editor. Anyone can write screenplays, stageplays, AV scripts, comic books or radio plays. Celtx also includes a rich text editor for outlines. Celtx also incorporates LaTeX in its Typeset feature. This allows for more flexible templates and printing options.

[edit] Project collaboration, management & storage
Celtx offers a web service called Celtx Studios for advanced project collaboration and previewing, and online file storage and management.

[edit] Publishing
Celtx projects can be uploaded to Project Central for public viewing, and peer reviews and commentary.

[edit] Scheduling
Celtx utilizes the open source Mozilla Lightning to handle calendaring. Different elements of the project can be added to any event in the calendar, and it can be synchronized over Project Central

[edit] Elements
Celtx features thirty-five different elements, which include 'Actor' or 'Special Effects', that can be added to the project. These elements can have various information, such as media or text, added to them. Celtx allows directors and writers to easily tag elements within each script. These tagged elements can then be automatically transferred to a script breakdown, which allows production staffers to easily know what elements the script calls for.

[edit] Storyboarding
Celtx allows people to create storyboard sequences, which can be printed or played using Celtx's built-in image viewer. These are also available to view on a project's website, and can be played inside the browser.
