This list of new religious movements (NRMs), lists groups that either identify themselves as religious, ethical or spiritual organizations, or are generally seen as such by religious scholars, which are independent of older denominations, churches, or religious bodies. Although there is no one criterion or set of criteria for describing a group as a "new religious movement", use of the term usually requires that the group be both of recent origin and different from existing religions.
Debate surrounds the phrase "of recent origin". Some authors use World War II as the dividing line, whereas others define as "new" everything after the advent of the Bahá'í Faith (mid-19th century) or even everything after Sikhism (17th century).[1]

[edit] Notes


^ The definitions of "new" vary greatly. Some authors such as Eileen Barker and David V. Barrett, see as new movements those originating or appearing in a new context after World War II, others define as "new" movements originating after the Bahá'í Faith or even everything originating after Sikhism. For this article, the following is used: "The historical bench-mark normally taken to divide new religions from old is the Second World War or shortly after. Thus Peter Clarke identifies his focus as 'those new religions that have emerged in Britain since 1945'.
