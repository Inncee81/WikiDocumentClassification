[edit] Career
An excellent student, he studied architecture at McGill University and apprenticed under Louis Kahn in Philadelphia. At age 24, his master's thesis was selected to be constructed as part of the Expo 67 celebration. The Habitat 67 project, a complex of cellular residences that could be lifted into place like LEGO blocks, propelled him onto the world stage. In 1967, he returned to Israel, where he was part of the team that refurnished Old Jerusalem. He lives in a renovated home in the Old City and has Israeli, U.S., and Canadian citizenship.
In 1976, he became a professor at Harvard University and set up his firm's head office in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts, where it remains today. In 1986, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2005. His company, Moshe Safdie and Associates, Inc. is based out of Boston with branch offices in Toronto and Jerusalem.
His son Oren Safdie is a playwright.
His daughter Taal, is an architect in San Diego, and partner of the husband-wife firm, Safdie Rabines Architects.
His nephew is Dov Charney, founder of the clothing company American Apparel.
