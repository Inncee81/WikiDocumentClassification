In hacker culture, a script kiddie, (compare to "speed kiddie"), occasionally script bunny, skiddie, script kitty, script-running juvenile (SRJ), or similar, is a derogatory term used to describe those who use scripts or programs developed by others to attack computer systems and networks. It is generally assumed that script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated hacking programs or exploits on their own, and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in underground hacker communities.[1]

[edit] Tools
Script kiddies have at their disposal a large number of effective, easily downloadable malicious programs capable of harassing even advanced computers and networks.[1] Such programs have included WinNuke applications, Back Orifice, NetBus, Sub7, Metasploit, ProRat and often software intended for legitimate security auditing.
Another simple means of attack is a mass mailer worm. These are spread through e-mails and, once opened, they can be automatically sent throughout entire systems, often without the users realizing it. The purpose of a worm varies, from sapping the targeted computer or network of bandwidth and therefore slowing performance, to deleting or encrypting files. Other commands are possible.
In a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, the attacker tries to shut down network activity in a target system by sapping the computer network of bandwidth or other resources. A number of distinct DoS attacks have been created that pursue this goal through different means, such as SYN flood, ICMP flood (a.k.a Smurf attack) and ping floods. If the server gets overwhelmed with excessive amounts of information, it will stop responding, and may require a restart.[2]

[edit] Famous examples
Script kiddies are often able to exploit vulnerable systems and strike with great success. Some of the most infamous examples include:

Michael Calce, a.k.a. MafiaBoy, from Montreal, Canada, was arrested in 2000 for using downloaded tools to launch DoS attacks against high-profile Web sites such as Yahoo!, Dell, eBay, and CNN. He was 15 years old at the time. The financial damages were estimated at roughly $7.5 million. He pleaded guilty to 56 criminal charges. On September 12, 2001, Calce appeared before the Montreal Youth Court in Canada and was sentenced to eight months "open custody", one year probation, and restricted use of the Internet.[3]
In 1999, NetBus was used to discredit a law student named Magnus Eriksson studying at the Lund University in Sweden. Child pornography was uploaded onto his computer from an unidentified location. He was later acquitted of charges in 2004 when it was discovered that NetBus had been used to control his computer.[4]
Jeffrey Lee Parson, a.k.a T33kid was an 18-year-old high school student from Minnesota who was responsible for spreading a variant of the infamous Blaster computer worm. Parson only modified the original Blaster worm, already prevalent, using a hex editor to add his screen name to the existing executable, and then attached another existing backdoor, Lithium, and posted it on his website. By making this subtle modification, the new executable was considered a variant, and authorities were able to trace the name back to him. The program was part of a DoS attack against computers using the Microsoft Windows operating system. The attack took the form of a SYN flood which caused only minimal damage. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2005.[5]
