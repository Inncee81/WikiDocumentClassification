From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A framekiller or frame buster is a piece of JavaScript code that doesn't allow a Web page to be displayed within a frame. A frame is a subdivision of a Web browser window and can act like a smaller window. This kind of script is often used to prevent a frame from an external Web site being loaded from within a frameset without permission.
The typical source code for a framekiller script is:

<script type="text/javascript">if (top !== self) top.location.replace(self.location.href);</script>

A variation that lets the user know why they are being redirected with the use of a pop-up alert is:

<script type="text/javascript">
    if (top !== self) {
        alert('The URL '+self.location.href+' cannot be viewed inside a frame.  You will be redirected.');
        top.location.replace(self.location.href);
    }
</script>


[edit] Limitations
Because this is a client-side Javascript solution, it relies on the end-user's browser to enforce their own security. This makes it a beneficial but unreliable means of disallowing your page to be embedded in other pages. The following situations may render the script above useless:

The user agent does not support JavaScript.
The user agent supports JavaScript, but this support has been opted out of by the user.
The user agent's JavaScript support is flawed or partially implemented.
The user agent's behavior is modified by a virus or plug-in (possibly without the user's knowledge) in a way that undermines the framekiller script.
