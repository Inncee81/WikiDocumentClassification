[edit] Content
The text of Think and Grow Rich! is founded on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, the result of more than twenty years of research based on Hill's close association with a large number of individuals who achieved great wealth during their lifetimes.[1]
At Andrew Carnegie's bidding, Hill studied the characteristics of these achievers and developed 15 "laws" of success intended to be applied by anybody to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich! condenses these laws further and provides the reader with 13 principles in the form of a philosophy of personal achievement.[1]

[edit] Variant editions
The first edition of Think and Grow Rich was released in March 1937. Only 5,000 copies were printed. Despite advertising for the book being mostly word of mouth, the original prints were sold out in six weeks at a price of $2.50 each. Another 10,000 copies were printed to meet demand, all of which also sold out in six weeks. The third print totaled 20,000.[3]
Since its publication in 1937, Think and Grow Rich has been reprinted, revised, edited, abridged, updated and even rewritten multiple times in many different languages and incarnations by many different publishers.[original research?] WorldCat alone lists over 120 editions.[4][unreliable source?]
In 2004, Ross Cornwell published Think and Grow Rich!: The Original Version, Restored and Revised (ISBN 1-59330-200-2), which restored the book to its original content, with slight revisions, and added the first comprehensive endnotes, index, and appendix the book has ever contained. This version went into a third printing in 2008.[5]
In 2004 an abridged text was published in a version titled Think and Grow Rich: The 21st-Century Edition: Revised and Updated (ISBN 1-932429-23-9). It was published by High Roads Media. In this version, author/editor Bill Hartley introduces modern examples of Hill's principles combined with editorial commentary throughout the book. Some readers have expressed negative opinions of this presentation, saying the modern examples are unnecessary, and the injection of outside commentary disrupts the flow of Napoleon Hill's original text.[6][unreliable source?]
