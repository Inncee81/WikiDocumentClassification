[edit] History
The site and project started out as a batch script to run Mozilla Firefox from a flash drive.[2]
John T. Haller then expanded the project to include Mozilla Thunderbird and OpenOffice.org. Soon the open source suite of programs outgrew Haller's personal WWW site and Haller moved it to a community site, PortableApps.com, which now serves as a location to centralize the knowledge and development efforts of portable application projects.

[edit] Compatibility
PortableApps.com applications are portable, meaning that they:

Do not require repeated installation from computer to computer;
Can be carried around computer to computer via portable device, while preserving history and settings; and
Leave no trace on the host computer, such as files or registry entries. All program settings and history are locally stored in the application's directory, or the application must delete all traces after use.

The majority of applications can run on almost any computer with Windows more recent than Windows 95 or with Linux under Wine.[3]

[edit] Platform

[edit] Installer
Application installers designed for use with PortableApps.com follow the convention of using filenames ending in a ".paf.exe" extension, and require:

Separation of application and data
HTML documentation

This allows for the simple backup of data with the PortableApps.combackup utility.
Application installers intended for use with PortableApps.com are generally NSIS launchers, but can also be compressed archives with self extractors, or indeed any executable.

[edit] Menu
The PortableApps Menu (PAM) provides simplified access to installed programs.

[edit] Community
The site currently hosts various projects created by forum members. The site is also used for bug reporting and suggestions.[4]

[edit] Criticisms

There had been some criticism regarding the delay between the official release of an application, and the availability of a portable version. [5]


The menu cannot launch automatically unless set up to do so on first install under Windows XP or Vista. Instead the user is prompted.[6][7]


A number of the applications included in PortableApps.com packages are inherently portable, with official versions of the software being released (for example) in ZIP format, which can simply be uncompressed and copied to a USB drive, where it would be ready for use anyway. The repackaging of these applications serves to integrate with the PortableApps menu. An example of this is XAMPP which is installed independently on the removable device and only integrated by using the XAMPP Launcher.[8] Some applications, while inherently portable, still leave traces on the host computer when the official version is used, such as Notepad++. [9]


[edit] List of applications
An up to date list of applications made portable and supported by PortableApps.com can be found on their website.

[edit] Press Coverage
PortableApps.com has been covered by most major PC publications including PC Magazine [10], Information Week [11], PC World [12], PC Pro (UK) [13], Maximum PC [14]. It has also been covered in newspapers like the Washington Post [15] and on television shows such as Channel 9 in Australia [16] as well as on broadcast radio, websites, blogs and podcasts. A full list of press coverage is available on the PortableApps.com website. [17]
