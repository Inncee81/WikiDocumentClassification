[edit] Personal life
Diane Arbus (née Nemerov) was born in New York City into a wealthy family, [1] the younger sister of Howard Nemerov, who served as United States Poet Laureate on two separate occasions. She attended the Fieldston School for Ethical Culture.
Edward Steichen's noted photo exhibit, The Family of Man, included a photograph credited to Diane Arbus and her husband.[2]

One of Arbus' studies included such people as Gloria Vanderbilt's then-infant son, future CNN anchorman Anderson Cooper, for Harper's Bazaar.[3]

[edit] Famous photographs




Arbus' Child with Toy Hand Grenade in Central Park, New York City (1962)



Child with Toy Hand Grenade in Central Park,[4] New York City (1962) — A scrawny boy, with the left strap of his jumper awkwardly hanging off his shoulder, tensely holds his long, thin arms by his side. Clenching a toy grenade in his right hand and holding his left hand in a claw-like gesture, his facial expression is maniacal. Arbus captured this photograph by having the boy stand while moving around him, claiming she was trying to find the right angle. The boy became impatient and told her to "Take the picture already!" This photo was also used, without permission, on the cover of punk band SNFU's first studio album, And No One Else Wanted to Play.


Identical Twins, Roselle, New Jersey, 1967 — Young twin sisters are seen standing side by side in corduroy dresses. One slightly smiles and the other slightly frowns. This photo is echoed in Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining, which features twins in an identical pose.


Jewish Giant at Home with His Parents in The Bronx, NY[5] (1970) — Eddie Carmel, the "Jewish Giant", stands in his family's apartment with his much shorter mother and father.

[edit] In media
In 2006, the film Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus was released, starring Nicole Kidman as Arbus. It used Patricia Bosworth's book Diane Arbus: A Biography as a source.
