David Graeber







Born
1961 (1961)


David Rolfe Graeber (born 12 February 1961) is an American anthropologist and anarchist. On June 15, 2007, Graeber accepted the offer of a lectureship in the anthropology department at Goldsmiths College, University of London, where he currently holds the title of Reader in Social Anthropology.[1] He was an associate professor of anthropology at Yale University, although Yale controversially declined to rehire him, and his term there ended in June 2007. Graeber has a history of social and political activism, including his role in protests against the World Economic Forum in New York City (2002) and membership in the labor union Industrial Workers of the World.

[edit] Education and writings
Graeber received his BA from the State University of New York at Purchase in 1984. He gained his Masters degree and Doctorate at the University of Chicago.
David Graeber is the author of Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology and Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams. He has done extensive anthropological work in Madagascar, writing his doctoral thesis (The Disastrous Ordeal of 1987: Memory and Violence in Rural Madagascar) on the continuing social division between the descendants of nobles and the descendants of former slaves. A book based on his dissertation, Lost People: Magic and the Legacy of Slavery in Madagascar appeared from Indiana University Press in September 2007. A book of collected essays, Possibilities: Essays on Hierarchy, Rebellion, and Desire was published by AK Press in November 2007 and Direct Action: An Ethnography is due to appear from the same press in 2008. He is currently working on three more book projects: one, a history of the concept of debt, scheduled to appear from Melville House in Fall 2009; another, an attempt with Andrej Grubacic to outline an anarchist version of world-systems analysis; and, finally, a small book tentatively entitled The Archaeology of Sovereignty, along with numerous minor projects. With Stevphen Shukaitis, he also is co-editor of a recently released collection of essays entitled "Constituent Imagination: Militant Investigations//Collective Theorization" (May 2007).

[edit] Dismissal from Yale
In May 2005, the Yale anthropology department decided not to renew Graeber's contract. Pointing to Graeber's highly-regarded anthropological scholarship, his supporters (including fellow anthropologists, former students, and anarchists) have accused the dismissal decision of being politically motivated. The Yale administration argued that Graeber's dismissal was in keeping with Yale's policy of granting tenure to few junior faculty and Yale has given no formal explanation for its actions. Graeber has suggested that his support of a student of his targeted for expulsion because of her membership in GESO, Yale's graduate student union, may have played a role in Yale's decision.[2]
In December 2005, Graeber agreed to leave the university after a one-year paid sabbatical. That spring he taught two final classes: an introduction to cultural anthropology (attended by over 200 students) and a course entitled "Direct Action and Radical Social Theory"- the only explicitly radical-themed course at Yale he ever taught.
On 25 May 2006, Graeber was invited to give the Malinowski Lecture at the London School of Economics. Maurice Bloch, Professor of Anthropology (retired) at the LSE and European Professor at the Collège de France, and world renowned scholar on Madagascar, made the following statement about Graeber in a letter to Yale University: "His writings on anthropological theory are outstanding. I consider him the best anthropological theorist of his generation from anywhere in the world." The Anthropology Department at the LSE honors an anthropologist at a relatively early stage of his or her career to give The Malinowski Lecture each year, and only invite those who are considered to have made a significant contribution to anthropological theory.
