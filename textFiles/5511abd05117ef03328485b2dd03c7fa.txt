In 1992, he founded the German record label FAX +49-69/450464, which he oversees.

[edit] Overview
As of August 2005, Namlook and company had released 135 albums (excluding re-releases, vinyl singles, compilations of existing material, and FAX releases beginning with PS, in which he personally is not involved in the music making).
Pete Namlook has released many solo albums, as well as collaboration albums with notable artists such as Klaus Schulze, Bill Laswell, Geir Jenssen (alias Biosphere), Atom Heart, Richie Hawtin, Tetsu Inoue, and Dr Atmo.
“Namlook” is “Koolman” spelled backwards, which is the German pronunciation of his real name.

[edit] Projects
These are all of Namlook's project series on the FAX label, with the number of albums in each series. For one-shot albums, the title is given without a number after it.
(Note: These are only the CD releases. Vinyl singles and EPs are not included. There are no full length LPs on FAX.)
