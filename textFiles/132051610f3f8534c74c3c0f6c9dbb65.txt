The world's principal religions and spiritual traditions may be classified into a small number of major groups or world religions. According to the 2005 survey of Encyclopædia Britannica, the vast majority of religious and spiritual adherents follow Christianity (33% of world population), Islam (20%), Hinduism (13%), Chinese folk religion (6.3%) or Buddhism (5.9%). The irreligious and atheists make up about 14%, and about 4% follow indigenous tribal religions. A number of classical "world religions" (including Sikhism, Judaism, Bahá'í, Jainism, Shinto and others) are each followed by under 0.5% of the world's population; they are sometimes considered world religions in terms of cultural significance and historic recognition, but are not deemed to be "major religious groups" due to their size.
These spiritual traditions may be either combined into larger super-groups, or separated into smaller sub-denominations. Christianity, Islam and Judaism (and sometimes the Bahá'í Faith) are summarized as Abrahamic religions. Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism are classified as Indian religions (or Dharmic religions). Chinese folk religion, Confucianism, Taoism and Shinto are classified as East Asian religions (or Far Eastern, Chinese, or Taoic religions).
Conversely, many major spiritual traditions may be parsed into denominations:

Christianity into Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestantism, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Nestorianism (see Christian denominations)
Islam into Sunni, Shi'a, Sufism, and Kharijites (see divisions of Islam)
Hinduism into Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Smartism, and others (see Hindu denominations)
Buddhism into Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana (see Schools of Buddhism)
Judaism into Hasidic, Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform (see Jewish denominations)

[edit] World religions

[edit] Historical notions
The concept of "world religion" is historically based on a subjective perception of temporal or theological importance, usually from a Western, "Christian" (or at least "Abrahamic") perspective.[citation needed]
Early Christian scholars, the earliest known classifiers of major religions, recognized two "proper" religions, Christianity and Judaism, besides heretical deviations from Christianity, and idolatrous relapse or paganism. Islamic theology recognizes Christians and Jews as "People of the Book" rather than idolaters, however, Christians are criticized for believing in Christ as God incarnate, rather than considering Christ as one prophet and/or messenger along with others (especially Muhammad in particular). The Christian view long classified Islam's rejection of Christ's divinity as one heresy among others. The concept of the Trinity is often seen as a fundamental conflict between Islam and some interpretations of Christianity to this day.[citation needed]
Attempts to identify and classify additional religions expanded during the Enlightenment however, and by the 19th century Western scholars considered the five "world religions" to be Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism. These remain the classic "world religions."[citation needed]

[edit] Modern classifications
Modern classifications typically list major religious groups by number of adherents, not by historical or theological notability. Most dramatically, this affects Judaism, which holds the position of "world religion" as the foundational tradition of the "Abrahamic" group, but which in terms of adherents ranks below 0.25% of world population, behind Sikhism.[1]
The remaining four classic world religions, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, are the largest contemporary religions by far. They each have more than 300 million adherents, more than ten times the number of the next largest organized religion (Sikhism, ca. 19 million per the Christian Science Monitor source cited below).
A person is typically considered an adherent or follower of a particular religion if the person would self-identify the religion as the primary characterization of their religious perspective.[2] Similarly, a religion is typically considered to fall within a larger religious category (e.g., Protestantism falling within Christianity) if the followers of the religion self-identify that classification as appropriate.
An example of a modern listing of "world religions" is that of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, listing twelve "long established, major world religions, each with over three million followers", alphabetically:

Bahá'í Faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Shinto, Sikhism, Taoism, Vodun/Vodou (and related religions).

The "World's Major Religions" list published in the New York Public Library Student's Desk Reference[3] omits Vodou and Zoroastrianism, as well as Jainism and Sikhism, but lists the Eastern Orthodox Church, Protestantism and Roman Catholicism as separate religions.
The Christian Science Monitor, in a 1998 article "Top 10 Organized Religions in the World," provides a listing of the largest "organized religions":[4]

[edit] Classification
Further information: Comparative religion and Sociological classifications of religious movements
Religious traditions fall into super-groups in comparative religion, arranged by historical origin and mutual influence. Abrahamic religions originate in the Middle East, Indian religions in India and Far Eastern religions in East Asia. Another group with supra-regional influence are African diasporic religions, which have their origins in Central and West Africa.

Abrahamic religions are by far the largest group, and these consist primarily of Christianity, Islam and Judaism (sometimes the Bahá'í Faith is also included). They are named for the patriarch Abraham, and are unified by the practice of monotheism. Today, around 3.4 billion people are followers of Abrahamic religions and are spread widely around the world apart from the regions around South-East Asia. Several Abrahamic organizations are vigorous proselytizers.[6]
Indian religions originated in Greater India and tend to share a number of key concepts, such as dharma and karma. They are of the most influence across the Indian subcontinent, East Asia, South East Asia, as well as isolated parts of Russia. The main Indian religions are Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism. Indian religions mutually influenced each other. Sikhism was also influenced by the Abrahamic tradition of Sufism.
East Asian religions consist of several East Asian religions which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Do (in Japanese or Korean), namely Taoism and Confucianism, both of which are asserted by some scholars to be non-religious in nature.
African diasporic religions practiced in the Americas, imported as a result of the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 18th centuries, building of traditional religions of Central and West Africa.
Indigenous tribal religions, formerly found on every continent, now marginalized by the major organized faiths, but persisting as undercurrents of folk religion. Includes African traditional religions, Asian Shamanism, Native American religions, Austronesian and Australian Aboriginal traditions, Chinese folk religion, and postwar Shinto. Under more traditional listings, this has been referred to as "Paganism" along with historical polytheism.
Iranic religions (not listed below due to overlaps) originated in Iran and include Zoroastrianism, Yazdanism, Ahl-e Haqq and historical traditions of Gnosticism (Mandaeanism, Manichaeism). It has significant overlaps with Abrahamic traditions, e.g. in Sufism and in recent movements such as Bábísm and the Bahá'í Faith.
New religious movement is the term applied to any religious faith which has emerged since the 19th century, often syncretizing, re-interpreting or reviving aspects of older traditions: Hindu revivalism, Ayyavazhi, Pentecostalism, polytheistic reconstructionism, and so forth.

[edit] Religious demographics
Further information: List of religious populations
One way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example USA or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count.
There is no consensus among researchers as to the best methodology for determining the religiosity profile of the world's population. A number of fundamental aspects are unresolved:

Whether to count "historically predominant religious culture[s]"[18]
Whether to count only those who actively "practice" a particular religion[19]
Whether to count based on a concept of "adherence"[20]
Whether to count only those who expressly self-identify with a particular denomination[21]
Whether to count only adults, or to include children as well.
Whether to rely only on official government-provided statistics[22]
Whether to use multiple sources and ranges or single "best source(s)"

This listing[a] includes both organized religions, which have unified belief codes and religious hierarchies, and informal religions, such as Chinese folk religions. For completeness, it also contains a category for the non-religious, although their views would not ordinarily be considered a religion.

Christianity: 2.1 billion, with major branches as follows: [b]

See also the List of Christian denominations by number of members and List of Christian denominations pages (Non-denominational statistics are not shown.)
Roman Catholic Church: 1.05 billion
Eastern Orthodox Church: 240 million
African Initiated Church: 110 million
Pentecostalism: 105 million
Reformed/Presbyterian/Congregational/United: 75 million
Anglicanism/Episcopal Church: 73 million
Baptist: 70 million
Methodism: 70 million
Lutheran: 64 million
Spiritism: 15 million[b]
Jehovah's Witnesses: 14.8 million
Latter-day Saints: 12.5 million
Seventh-day Adventist Church: 12 million
Apostolic/New Apostolic: 10 million
Restoration Movement: 5.4 million
New Thought (Unity, Christian Science, etc.): 1.5 million
Brethren (incl. Plymouth): 1.5 million
Mennonite: 1.25 million
Friends/Quakers: 300,000


Islam: 1.5 billion, with major branches as follows:[d]

Sunni: 940 million
Shia: 120 million
Ahmadi: 10 million
Druze: 450,000


Secular/irreligious/agnostic/atheist/antitheistic/antireligious: 1.1 billion

Category includes a wide range of beliefs, without specifically adhering to a religion or sometimes specifically against dogmatic religions. The category includes humanism, deism, pantheism, rationalism, freethought, agnosticism and atheism. Broadly labeled humanism, this group of non religious people are third largest in the world. For more information, see the note below. [c]


Hinduism: 900 million, with major branches as follows:

Vaishnavism: 580 million
Shaivism: 220 million
Neo-Hindus and Reform Hindus: 22 million
Veerashaivas/Lingayats: 10 million


Chinese folk religion: 394 million

Not a single organized religion, includes elements of Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism and traditional nonscriptural religious observance (also called "Chinese traditional religion").[f]


Buddhism: 376 million, with major branches as follows:

Mahayana: 185 million
Theravada: 124 million
Vajrayana/Tibetan: 20 million


Primal indigenous (tribal religions): 300 million

Not a single organized religion, includes a wide range of traditional or tribal religions, including animism, shamanism and paganism. Since African traditional and diasporic religions are counted separately in this list, most of the people counted in this group are in Asia.


African traditional and diasporic: 100 million

Not a single organized religion, this includes several traditional African beliefs and philosophies such as those of the Yoruba, Ewe (Vodun) and the Bakongo. These three religious traditions (especially that of the Yoruba) have been very influential to the diasporic beliefs of the Americas such as Condomble, Santeria and Vodou. The religious capital of the Yoruba religion is at Ile Ife.


Sikhism: 23 million
Judaism: 14 million, with major branches as follows:

Conservative: 4.5 million
Unaffiliated and Secular: 4.5 million
Reform: 3.75 million
Orthodox: 2 million
Reconstructionist: 150,000


Bahá'í Faith: 7 million
Jainism: 4.2 million, with significant branches as follows:

Svetambara (White clad): 4,000,000
Sthanakvasi: 750,000
Digambar (Sky clad): 155,000


Shinto: 4 million

This number states the number of actual self-identifying practising primary followers of Shinto. If everyone were included who is considered Shinto by some people due to ethnic or historical categorizations, the number would be considerably higher — as high as 100 million (according to source).


Cao Dai: 4 million
Tenrikyo: 2 million
Neopaganism: 1 million

A blanket term for several religions like Wicca, Asatru, Neo-druidism, and polytheistic reconstructionist religions


Unitarian Universalism: 800,000
Rastafari: 600,000
Scientology: 500,000
Zoroastrianism: 150,000-250,000,[23][24][25][26][27][28], although in its top-level overview list the same source provides a substantially different estimate.[e] The breakdown by major communities is as follows:

In India (the Parsis): est. 65,000 (2001 India Census: 69,601); Estimate of Zoroastrians of Indian origin: 100,000-110,000.
In Iran: est. 20,000 (1974 Iran Census: 21,400)




Notes



a)^  The source for most of these statistics is [3], updated 2008. These statistics are reportedly based on analysis of a range of sources on religious populations, for more on the methodology, please see [4].


b)^  Spiritism is often considered to fall within the Christianity category. This is the approach taken in the list above, which differs from the categorization used at [5].


c)^  This list classifies Juche under the secular/non-religious category, since it does not fit most definitions of religion and is considered secular by its followers.


d)^  Ahmadiyya consider themselves Muslim, but they are not considered Muslim by the mainstream. [6] includes Druze as Muslim, but they are often considered by other sources to be a distinct religious community that is an offshoot of Islam.


e)^  The main list at [7] estimates 2.6 million followers of Zoroastrianism, but its detailed section refers to "less than 200,000."


f)^  The New York Times reported in 1999 that Falun Gong itself claimed "more than 100 million followers" and reported a Chinese government estimate of 70 million for the group. The source for data in this table, which includes Falun Gong as part of Chinese religion, mentions 10 million as a potentially more reasonable "guess".

[edit] Trends in adherence





This material is neither peer-reviewed nor otherwise accompanied by a description of methodology or an assertion of adherence to scientific methods. It relies largely or entirely upon a single source. Please help improve this article by introducing appropriate citations of additional sources. (November 2007)






World map based on the results of a 2002 Pew Research Center study on the percentage of people who regard religion as "important"






World map showing the percentages of people who regard religion as "non-important"



The general trend is that the religious belief is decreasing over time and throughout the world as a whole. This is the process that is called secularization. The process of secularization has not stopped; the number of religious adherents worldwide continue to decrease as a share of total populations. This trend includes the United States. However, secularization has slowed down in comparison to some earlier estimates.[29] Religions that have increased in absolute or relative numbers have largely done so through differences in birth-rates.
Since the late 19th century the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. Some countries with a historically large Christian population have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the priesthood and monastic life, as well as diminishing attendance at church. At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as secular humanists. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, particularly in the forms of Neopaganism and Far Eastern religions.
Within the world's four largest religions, Christianity currently has the greatest growth by numbers and Islam has the fastest growth by percentage.[30] Following is some available data based on the work of World Christian Database and its predecessor, the World Christian Encyclopedia:


1970-1985[31]
1990-2000[30][32]
2000-2005[33]


3.65% - Bahá'í Faith
2.65% - Zoroastrianism
1.84% - Islam


2.74% - Islam
2.28% - Bahá'í Faith
1.70% - Bahá'í Faith


2.34% - Hinduism
2.13% - Islam
1.62% - Sikhism


1.67% - Buddhism
1.87% - Sikhism
1.57% - Hinduism


1.64% - Christianity
1.69% - Hinduism
1.32% - Christianity


1.09% - Judaism
1.36% - Christianity




1.09% - Buddhism




The annual growth in the world population over the same period is 1.41%.



While controversial in some respects, the results have been studied and found "highly correlated with other sources of data" but "consistently gave a higher estimate for percent Christian in comparison to other cross-national data sets" according to one study.[34]
A 2002 Pew Research Center study found that, generally, poorer nations had a larger proportion of citizens who found religion to be very important than richer nations, with the exception of the United States.[35]
