The Mars trilogy is a series of award-winning science fiction novels by Kim Stanley Robinson, chronicling the settlement and terraforming of the planet Mars through the intensely personal and detailed viewpoints of a wide variety of characters spanning almost two centuries. Ultimately more utopian than dystopian, the story focuses on egalitarian, sociological, and scientific advances made on Mars, while Earth suffers from overpopulation and ecological disaster.
The three novels are Red Mars (1992), Green Mars (1993) and Blue Mars (1996). An additional collection of short stories and background information was published as The Martians (1999). The main trilogy won a number of prestigious awards.

[edit] Plot

[edit] Red Mars - Colonization
Red Mars starts in 2026 with the first colonial voyage to Mars aboard the largest interplanetary spacecraft ever, the Ares, with a crew of the "First Hundred" colonists, composed for the most part of Russians and Americans. The book details the construction of the first settlement on Mars, called "Underhill". A debate among the colonists breaks out about the advisability of terraforming the planet, focusing on the two extreme views personified by Saxifrage "Sax" Russell who believes their very presence on the planet means some level of terraforming has already begun and it should be continued, a viewpoint held by "the Greens." Ann Clayborne represents "the Reds" viewpoint that mankind does not have the right to change entire planets at their will and Mars should be left in its original state. Hiroko Ai represents a middle ground, believing that a new way of living could evolve on Mars, a philosophy referred to as "Areophany".
The Greens eventually win out, through direct intervention in some cases, and the first steps to terraforming Mars start during the book. At the same time, new towns are developed across the planet, increasingly "open" as new technologies and materials allow pressure to be contained in new ways. However, due to the greed of the transnational corporations which come to dominate and control the nation states of Earth, the new Martian towns become overcrowded and undermaintained. Several cases of sabotage of terraformation infrastructure occur, blamed on anti-terraforming forces. The situation results in a violent revolution in 2061, in which many of the First Hundred are killed, and much of Mars' infrastructure, notably the space elevator, and Phobos, are destroyed. Most of the surviving members of the First Hundred are forced into hiding in the "underground", in this case a literal underground shelter created by Hiroko Ai under the Martian south pole.

[edit] Green Mars - Terraforming
Green Mars takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has taken place allowing plants to grow. It picks up the story from Red Mars, following the lives of the remaining First Hundred (and their children and grandchildren). Hiroko Ai's base under the south pole is attacked by UN forces and the survivors are forced to escape into a less literal underground known as the "demimonde". Among the expanded group are the First Hundred's children, the nisei, a number of whom live in Ai's second secret base, Zygote.
As unrest in the multinational control over Mars' affairs grow, various groups start to form with different aims and methods. Watching these groups evolve from Earth, the CEO of Praxis Corporation sends his representative, Arthur Randolph, to organize the resistance movements. This culminates into the Dorsa Brevia agreement, in which nearly all the underground factions take part. Preparations are made for a second revolution beginning in the 2120s.
The book follows the characters across the martian landscape, which is explained in detail. As Sax Russell's character infiltrates the transnat terraforming project, the newly evolving martian biosphere is described at great length. A mainstay of the novel is a detailed analysis of philosophical, political, economical, and geological experiences of the characters. The story weaves back and forth from character to character, providing a picture of Mars as seen by them.
One major event is a sudden, catastrophic rise in Earth's global sea levels, caused not by any greenhouse effect, but by the eruption of a chain of volcanoes underneath the ice of west Antarctica, disintegrating the ice sheet and displacing the fragments into the ocean.

[edit] Blue Mars - Long-Term results
Blue Mars takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has taken place allowing atmospheric pressure and temperature to increase so that liquid water can exist on the planet's surface, forming rivers and seas. It follows on from the end of Green Mars and has a much wider scope than the previous two books, covering an entire century after the second revolution and showing the spread of human settlements across the solar system — a process Robinson terms the Accelerando.

[edit] The Martians - Short stories
The Martians is a collection of short stories that takes place over the timespan of the original trilogy of novels, as well as some stories that take place in an alternate version of the novels where the First Hundred's mission was one of exploration rather than colonization. Buried in the stories are several hints about the eventual fate of the Martian terraforming program.

[edit] Writing style





This article may contain original research or unverified claims. Please improve the article by adding references. See the talk page for details. (July 2008)


The author, Kim Stanley Robinson, uses a third person perspective throughout the entire series. We follow a multitude of characters who see the plot from different angles. This gives the reader a broad picture of the developments in the novels. The chapters are separated by "Arch" chapters which mark off the character the reader follows.
Another interesting aspect to his writing style is the protagonist/antagonist relationships. Because the series spans a period of 200 years, there are multiple characters that hold the title of protagonist. In contrast the antagonist position is only filled by one or two characters (depending on the readers perspective). More so, Robinson introduces a unique perspective on the protagonist/antagonist relationship. The transnational corporations which play an integral role in the series also match each other in this bond. Unlike the individual characters, this relationship lasts through all three books.
Robinson also does not just use the standard plot graph of build up, climax, and conclusion. The books delve into much more than one plot, each with its own time line and conclusion. But all of these fall under the great umbrella that defines the Mars Trilogy - the colonization of Mars. Such an example of this is relationships between characters in which end abruptly, only to be touched upon again much later in the story as a 'side note', but sufficiently reminds the reader that it did play a part in the development of the character.

[edit] Story elements

[edit] Corporations
Transnational corporations, nicknamed "transnats", are extremely powerful multinational corporations that first emerge in the mid-21st century. These multinational corporations have grown so large as a result of globalisation that they have sufficient economic power to take over or strongly manipulate national governments, initially only relatively small Third World governments, but later larger developed governments too. In Robinson's future history, the transnational corporations hence inherit the nation-state, continually to attempting to take over competitors in order to become the sole controller of the interplanetary market. As the Mars trilogy draws to a close, in the mid 22nd century, the transnational corporations are forced by a global catastrophe to concede more democratic powers to their workforces.
Although there are many transnational corporations mentioned, two play an active role in the development of the plotline. Praxis, a largely benevolent and relatively democratic firm, and Subarashii, which plays a large role in the maltreatment of the citizens of Mars.

[edit] Other themes
The books also speculate on the colonization of other planets and moons in the solar system, and include descriptions of settlements or terraforming efforts on Callisto, Mercury, Titania, Miranda and Venus. Towards the end of the last book, humans are taking sub-light colony ships to other stars, taking advantage of the longevity treatments to survive to their destinations.
A great portion of Blue Mars is concerned with the effects of extreme longevity on its protagonists, most of whom have lived over two hundred years as a result of repeated longevity treatments. In particular, Robinson speculates on the psychological effects of ultra-longevity including memory loss, personality change, mental instability and boredom.

[edit] Characters

[edit] The First Hundred
The initial colonists from the Ares who established a permanent colony. Many of them later become leaders or exemplary figures in the transformation of Mars or its new society.

[edit] John Boone


Mars trilogy character





John Boone


Position
First man on Mars


Hometown
Minnesota, USA


Birth
1982


Death
2061


Gender
male


Political Affiliation
First Hundred


An American astronaut, and the first man on Mars. He returns from Mars a public hero, and uses his considerable influence to lobby for a second mission, this time one of colonization. Boone received too much radiation on his first trip to make the second one, according to medical regulations; however, his celebrity status allows him to skirt this. On the second voyage, Boone is one of the 'First Hundred' colonists sent to permanently colonize Mars. His accomplishments and natural charm yield him an informal leadership role. In the first chapter of Red Mars, John Boone is assassinated by fundamentalists acting under the aegis of Frank Chalmers. The narrative then steps back to the First Hundred's voyage to Mars aboard the spaceship Ares. His ideas continue as a point of reference for the remainder of the trilogy. Boone's character is complex. In one light, Boone is a stereotypically simple, heroic figure, an everyman hero: his first words on his first trip to Mars are "Well, here we are". He is almost uniformly cheerful and good-natured, and approaches everything he undertakes with hale bonhomie. But later in Red Mars, Robinson switches to Boone's point of view, rather than showing him through others' eyes. This section reveals that late in life, Boone is addicted to omegendorph, a fictional drug that is based on endorphins in the human brain. In addition, it reveals that at least some of his seeming simplicity might simply be an act designed to further his political goals. Overall, Boone is presented as larger-than-life.

[edit] Frank Chalmers


Mars trilogy character





Frank Chalmers


Position
Head of the American Contingent


Hometown
Savannah, Georgia/Jacksonville Beach Florida, USA


Birth
1976


Death
2061


Gender
male


Political Affiliation
First Hundred


Head of the American contingent. He is Machiavellian in his use of power. However, his cynicism is later shown to be a form of self-defense; Chalmers is at least partly driven by a hidden idealistic side. Early in the voyage to Mars he became romantically involved with Maya Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent of the mission. During the second-half of the voyage, Maya became involved with John Boone. Already bitter that John was allowed to join the colonization mission despite his manipulations, Frank further despised John because of Maya's affection. His dislike culminates in his involvement in a plot to assassinate John, which ultimately succeeds. Frank later flees with Maya and other members of the Hundred to join the hidden colonists at the polar ice cap. He dies trying to save them when they get trapped in a flood unleashed from underground aquifers.

[edit] Maya Toitovna


Mars trilogy character





Maya Toitovna


Position
Head of Russian Contingent


Hometown
Moscow, Russia


Birth
August 5, 1984


Death
UNKNOWN


Gender
female


Political Affiliation
First Hundred


An emotional woman who is at the centre of a love triangle between Boone and Chalmers. She begins as head of the Russian contingent. The novels hint she used both wit and seduction to rise through the ranks of the Russian space agency to become the leader of the first colonization mission. After the first revolution she flees with other members of the Hundred to the hidden colony in the pole. She becomes a school teacher for the children of the hidden colonists, but later becomes a powerful political force. After the deaths of Chalmers and Boone, she falls in love with Michel Duval. She suffers heavily from amnesia and a bipolar disorder with growing age.

[edit] Nadia Chernyshevski


Mars trilogy character





Nadia Chernyshevski


Position
Head Engineer


Hometown
Siberia


Birth



Death



Gender
female


Political Affiliation
First Hundred; Martian Republic


A Russian engineer who started out building nuclear reactors in Siberia. During the voyage and initial exploration of Mars, she does her best to avoid the squabbles of the other members of the Hundred. Instead, she busies herself by building the first permanent habitation of Mars, Underhill, using programmed automated robots. She also helps to construct a new and larger habitat and research facility in a nearby canyon. In the later books she becomes a reluctant politician. Nadia is in love with Arkady Bogdanov and is devastated when he is murdered during the first Martian revolution by anti-revolutionary forces associated with UNOMA, the transnationals, and Phyllis Boyle. In retaliation for Arkady's murder, she activates his last weapon system, built into Phobos, which causes the entire moon (a UNOMA/transnational military base) to decelerate in orbit and destructively aerobrake in Mars' atmosphere, utterly destroying it. In Green Mars she falls in love with Art Randolph, with whom she eventually starts a family. After Martian independence, she grudgingly becomes the first "President" of Mars.

[edit] Arkady Bogdanov


Mars trilogy character





Arkady Bogdanov


Position

Birth



Death
2061


Gender
male


Political Affiliation
First Hundred, Bogdanovists


An engineer with anarchist leanings, possibly based on Russian futurists Alexander Bogdanov (the character's ancestor) and Arkady Strugatsky. He is seen by many other members of the First Hundred, particularly Boyle, as a troublemaker. He leads the team which establishes an outpost on the moon Phobos and leads an uprising against the transnational corporation towards the end of first book. Like Boone's, his political ideas (known as "Bogdanovism") weigh heavily on characters later in the book. In love with Nadia Chernyshevski, he is killed during the first revolution of 2061.

[edit] Saxifrage "Sax" Russell


Mars trilogy character





Sax Russell


Position
Head of Mars Terraforming (co-figurehead of the Greens)


Hometown
Boulder, Colorado


Birth
~1980


Death



Gender
male


Political Affiliation
First Hundred; Green


American physicist. He is a brilliant and creative scientist and is greatly respected for his intellectual gifts. However, he is lacking in social skills and often finds it difficult to understand and relate to other people. Russell is a leader of the Green movement (a movement whose goal is to terraform Mars). During Green Mars, Sax suffers a stroke while being tortured by government security forces. He subsequently suffers from Broca's aphasia and has to relearn speech. Originally apolitical, this event and a growing attachment to Mars itself leads Russell to become the physical architect of the second revolution. Secretly in love with Ann Clayborne. Saxifrage means "Stonebreaker" (Russell is a terraformer) and is the name for a plant that grows between stones.

[edit] Ann Clayborne


Mars trilogy character





Ann Clayborne


Position
Figurehead of the Reds


Hometown



Birth
1980


Death



Gender
female


Political Affiliation
First Hundred; Reds


American geologist, who wants Mars preserved in its pristine state. She becomes a leader of the Red movement which is dedicated to this goal. She is frequently seen as bitter and preferably lives in solitude on extensive trips all over Mars. She has a hate-love relationship with Saxifrage Russell, an American physicist and leader of the Green Mars movement that wants to terraform Mars. After she shows signs of aging and her death seems imminent, Russell has the longevity cure administered to her (she being in a coma). She develops a more complex personality afterwards - sometimes remaining close to her isolationist position, sometimes appreciating the cure and the "blue" Mars.

[edit] Hiroko Ai


Mars trilogy character





Hiroko Ai


Position
Head of the Farm Team, Head of the hidden colony (co-figurehead of the Greens)


Hometown
Hokkaidō, Japan


Birth
~1993


Death
unknown


Gender
female


Political Affiliation
First Hundred; Green


A Japanese expert on biology, agriculture, and ecological systems. It was Hiroko who smuggled Desmond 'Coyote' Hawkins onto the Ares (the two were friends and lovers as students in London). She is the charismatic leader of the "farm team", one of the important work groups and cliques among the first hundred. She thus becomes the focus of many of the trilogy's central themes. Most importantly, she teaches the importance of maintaining a respectful relation to one's planet. On Mars, this is called the Areophany. In the secret colony, Zygote, which Hiroko established, the first generation of children, the 'ectogenes', are all the product of artificial insemination outside of any human body; Hiroko uses her own ova as the female genetic material, and uses (often unaware) male members of the first hundred to fertilize these eggs. Although Hiroko is seldom at the center of the narrative, her influence is pervasive. Her profound absences are on the scale of John Galt in Atlas Shrugged or Harry Lime in The Third Man. She disappears again in Green Mars. Her ultimate fate is left unresolved. In Japanese, Ai means 'love'


[edit] Michel Duval


Mars trilogy character





Michel Duval


Position
First Hundred Psycologist


Hometown
Provence, France


Birth



Death
2206


Gender
male


Political Affiliation
First Hundred; Green


A French psychologist, assigned to monitor the psychological welfare of the First Hundred first in their training in Antarctica and then was later sent to Mars. He is often treated more as an observer than as a member of the group. His aloof personality enforces this ostracism and also subverts his relationships with others. Two girlfriends leave him because "he was not there." He subsequently is invited by Hiroko to flee with the botany group to become the first hidden colonists. He desperately wants to go back to Provence as he knew it, although after visiting as a part of the Diplomatic Mission to Earth he became even more homesick. Falls in love with Maya Toitovna and dies after she displays signs of very heavy temporary memory loss.


[edit] Vlad Taneev


Mars trilogy character





Vlad Taneev


Position
Head of Medical Team


Hometown
Russia


Birth
1968


Death



Gender
male


Political Affiliation
First Hundred


Russian biological scientist; nearly sixty when arriving on Mars, he is the oldest of the First Hundred. Taneev is the head of all medical treatment and research projects on Mars. He became famous as the creator of a gerontological treatment to stave off old age, and for consistently bringing out improvements to the Treatments. He lived in Acheron in the North of Mars before fleeing to the Underground after the First (failed) Revolution. He lived in a ménage à trois with Ursula and Marina, the exact nature of which is never resolved.

[edit] Phyllis Boyle


Mars trilogy character





Phyllis Boyle


Position
Head of UNOMA/UNTA


Hometown
USA


Birth



Death



Gender
Unknown


Political Affiliation
First Hundred; UN, Transnats


American Christian geologist, who favors corporate control of Mars. Her harsh personality does not win her many friends among the First Hundred. She eventually sides against most of the First Hundred with the increasingly-authoritarian United Nations Office of Mars Affairs (UNOMA), and its successor, the corporatist/quasi-fascist United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTA), as well as the transnational corporations who were their puppet-masters. She was in charge of Clark Space Elevator until the first, failed revolution sent it spinning off into the outer Solar System. She survived and was able to bring the station back to the inner systems. She engaged in a brief sexual relationship with Saxifrage Russell, who despised her, while he was working under an alias. Boyle is killed by Maya Toitovna (who thought she was torturing Sax) during the rescue of Saxifrage Russell from Kasei Vallis. Later it is revealed by Saxifrage Russell that, immediately prior to her death, she had been opposed to his torture and demanded that he be released.


[edit] Desmond "the Coyote" Hawkins


Mars trilogy character





Coyote


Position
Stowaway


Hometown
Trinidad


Birth



Death



Gender
male


Political Affiliation
First Hundred


The Trinidadian stowaway. He is a friend and supporter of Hiroko, and a fervent anarchist. Present in Red Mars only as a shadowy figure who blends effortlessly into the Martian background, he isn't even identified as anything more than "the Coyote" until the beginning of Green Mars. He becomes a leading figure in the "underground," and an unofficial coordinator of a developing gift economy. 
[edit] Their descendants
Since the trilogy covers over 200 years of human history, later immigrants and the children and grandchildren of the first hundred eventually become important characters in their own rights.

[edit] Kasei
Kasei is the son of Hiroko and John Boone, father of Jackie Boone. Kasei is the leader of the Kakaze, a radical Red faction. His name is Japanese for the planet Mars.

[edit] Peter Clayborne
Peter Clayborne is the son of Ann Clayborne and Simon Frazier. Being one of the first children born on Mars, Peter holds a position of older brother to all the following first generation. Many revolutionary and later political decisions of the MarsFirst movement are influenced by his opinions and judgement. Part time he works as an engineer and a "green."

[edit] Zoya "Zo" Boone
She is daughter of Jackie. Via the gerontological longevity treatment, she has feline traits (purring) inserted into her genome. In Blue Mars, she travels the solar system running political errands for Jackie, although the two do not get along particularly well. Her character is portrayed as hedonistic, making sexual satisfaction a priority and seemingly having little regard for the feelings of others. On the other hand, she apparently has a conscience, risking her life to rescue a man on Mercury and later dying in an attempt to save a distressed flier.

[edit] Nikki
She is the daughter of Nadia and Art.

Death



Gender

Political Affiliation
MarsFirst



[edit] Arthur "Art" Randolph
A representative of the Praxis corporation sent to contact the Martian underground movement on a quasi-diplomatic mission. The Praxis Corporation is an attempt to create a system of "ecological capitalism" based on democratic corporations; like the other "metanationals," it takes on intensive economic and political ties with governments, but Praxis aims for partnerships rather than exploitive relationships.

[edit] Zeyk Tuqa and his wife Nazik
They are Muslim nomads. Zeyk's eidetic memory becomes a minor plot point.

[edit] William Fort
He is the founder of Praxis, one of the huge multinational corporations. He embraces a fusion of Eastern and Western lifestyles.

[edit] Quotes

Boone: "Well, here we are."
Nirgal: "No hierarchy is worth acknowledging but this one: the more we give, the greater we become."
Zoya Boone: "It's like a rainbow. Without an observer at a twenty-three-degree angle to the light reflecting off a cloud of spherical droplets, there is no rainbow. The whole universe is like that. Our spirits stand at a twenty-three-degree angle to the universe. There is some new thing created at the contact of photon and retina, some space between rock and mind."
Hiroko Ai: "This is home. This is where we start again."
Sax Russell: "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to be a rocket scientist."


[edit] Awards

Red Mars won the BSFA Award in 1993 and the SFWA's Nebula Award in 1993.
Green Mars won the Hugo Award in 1994.
Blue Mars won the Hugo Award in 1997.


[edit] Adaptations and uses

[edit] Screen adaptations
The Mars trilogy rights were at one point held by James Cameron,[1] who planned a five-hour miniseries to be directed by Martha Coolidge,[2] but he passed on the option. Later Gale Ann Hurd planned a similar mini-series for the Sci-Fi Channel, which also remained unproduced.[3] Then in October 2008, it was reported that AMC and Jonathan Hensleigh had teamed up and were planning to develop a television mini-series based on Red Mars.[4]

[edit] On Phoenix spacecraft
The content of Green Mars is included on the 'Phoenix DVD', carried onboard of Phoenix, a NASA lander which successfully touched down on Mars in May 2008. The 'First Interplanetary Library' is intended to be a sort of time capsule for future Mars explorers and colonists.[5]
