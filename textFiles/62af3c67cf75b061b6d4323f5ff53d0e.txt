Packing problems are one area where mathematics meets puzzles (recreational mathematics). Many of these problems stem from real-life problems with packing items.
In a packing problem, you are given:

one or more (usually two- or three-dimensional) containers
several 'goods', some or all of which must be packed into this container

Usually the packing must be without gaps or overlaps, but in some packing problems the overlapping (of goods with each other and/or with the boundary of the container) is allowed but should be minimised. In others, gaps are allowed, but overlaps are not (usually the total area of gaps has to be minimised).

[edit] Problems
There are many different types of packing problems. Usually they involve finding the maximum number of a certain shape that can be packed into a larger, perhaps different shape.

[edit] Packing infinite space
Many of these problems, when the container size is increased in all directions, become equivalent to the problem of packing objects as densely as possible in infinite Euclidean space. This problem is relevant to a number of scientific disciplines, and has received significant attention. The Kepler conjecture postulated an optimal solution for spheres hundreds of years before it was proven correct by Hales. Many other shapes have received attention, including ellipsoids, tetrahedra, icosahedra, and unequal-sphere dimers.

[edit] Spheres into an Euclidean ball
The problem of packing k disjoint open unit balls inside a ball has a simple and complete answer in the n-dimensional Euclidean space if , and in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space with no restrictions. It is maybe worth describing it in detail here, to give a flavor of the general problem. In this case, it is available a configuration of k pairwise tangent unit balls (so the centers are the vertices a1,..,ak of a regular  dimensional symplex with edge 2; this is easily realized starting from an orthonormal basis). A small computation shows that the distance of each vertex from the baricenter is . Moreover, any other point of the space necessarily has a larger distance from at least one of the  vertices. In terms of inclusions of balls, this reads: the  open unit balls centered in  are included in a ball of radius , which is minimal for this configuration. To show that the configuration is also optimal, let  be the centers of  disjoint open unit balls contained in a ball of radius  centered in a point . Consider the map from the finite set  into  taking  in the corresponding  for each . Since for all  there holds  this map is 1-Lipschitz and by the Kirszbraun theorem it extends to a 1-Lipschitz map globally defined; in particular, there exists a point  such that for all  one has , so that also . This shows that there are  disjoint unit open balls in a ball of radius  if and only if . Notice that in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space this implies that there are infinitely many disjoint open unit balls inside a ball of radius  if and only if . For instance, the unit balls centered in , where  is an orthonormal basis, are disjoint and included in a ball of radius  centered in the origin. Moreover, for , the maximum number of disjoint open unit balls inside a ball of radius r is .

[edit] Sphere in cuboid
A classic problem is the sphere packing problem, where one must determine how many spherical objects of given diameter d can be packed into a cuboid of size a × b × c.

[edit] Packing circles
There are many other problems involving packing circles into a particular shape of the smallest possible size.

[edit] Hexagonal packing
Circles (and their counterparts in other dimensions) can never be packed with 100% efficiency in dimensions larger than one (in a one dimensional universe, circles merely consist of two points). That is, there will always be unused space if you are only packing circles. The most efficient way of packing circles, hexagonal packing produces approximately 90% efficiency. [1]

[edit] Circles in circle
Some of the more non-trivial circle packing problems are packing unit circles into the smallest possible larger circle.

[edit] Packing squares

[edit] Squares in square
A problem is the square packing problem, where one must determine how many squares of side 1 you can pack into a square of side a. Obviously, here if a is an integer, the answer is a2, but the precise, or even asymptotic, amount of wasted space for a a non-integer is open.

Other known results:

If you can pack n2 − 2 squares in a square of side a, then a ≥ n.[citation needed]
The naive approach (side matches side) leaves wasted space of less than 2a + 1.[citation needed]
The wasted space is asymptotically o(a7/11).[citation needed]
The wasted space is not asymptotically o(a1/2).[citation needed]

Walter Stromquist proved that 11 unit squares cannot be packed in a square of side less than 2 + 4×5 −1/2.[citation needed]

[edit] Tiling
In this type of problem there are to be no gaps, nor overlaps. Most of the time this involves packing rectangles or polyominoes into a larger rectangle or other square-like shape.

[edit] Rectangles in rectangle
There are significant theorems on tiling rectangles (and cuboids) in rectangles (cuboids) with no gaps or overlaps:

Klarner's theorem: An a × b rectangle can be packed with 1 × n strips iff n | a or n | b.
de Bruijn's theorem: A box can be packed with a harmonic brick a × a b × a b c if the box has dimensions a p × a b q × a b c r for some natural numbers p, q, r (i.e., the box is a multiple of the brick.)

When tiling polyominoes, there are two possibilities. One is to tile all the same polyomino, the other possibility is to tile all the possible n-ominoes there are into a certain shape.

[edit] All the same polyominoes in a rectangle



This section requires expansion.




[edit] Different polyominoes
A classic puzzle of this kind is pentomino, where the task is to arrange all twelve pentominoes into rectangles sized 3×20, 4×15, 5×12 or 6×10.
