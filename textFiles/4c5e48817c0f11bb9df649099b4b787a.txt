The Suite bergamasque (IPA: /'bɛʀgamask/) is one of the most famous piano suites by Claude Debussy. It was likely named after Paul Verlaine's poem "Clair de lune", which possibly alludes to a bergamask. It is also commonly believed that the Suite Bergamasque is derived from Fêtes Gallantes, a poem by Paul Verlaine. Debussy wrote the suite in 1888 at age 26, but it was not published until 1903. It has four movements:

Prélude
Menuet
Clair de lune
Passepied

The Prélude is in the key of F, tempo rubato. It is full of dynamic contrasts with a vigorous beginning and ending. The second movement is entitled Menuet, as in the Baroque suite form. Its playful main theme contrasts with an alternatively mysterious and dramatic middle section. It is followed by the famous Clair de lune (Moonlight), played mostly pianissimo. The final movement is Passepied in F-sharp minor, allegretto ma non troppo; it is again playful and ends quietly.
The first three movements include a common motif:

Prélude - F - E - F - E - D (bar 11)
Menuet - G - F - G - F - E (bar 6)
Clair de lune - F - E flat - F - E flat - D flat (bars 1-2)

The suite has been orchestrated by many composers, including André Caplet, Leopold Stokowski and Lucien Cailliet.

[edit] Prélude
The first piece in the suite is entitled Prélude. It is a festive piece, which holds much of the baroque style that is commonly found in preludes, however it is more complete than most preludes. This is also the begining and the end.

[edit] Menuet
The second part of the Suite Bergamasque is the Menuet. This piece is particularly original, as it does not conform to the particular style that most minuets share. Rather than being very airy and dainty, this comical piece shows much more raw comedy.

[edit] Clair de Lune
The third movement of Suite bergamasque is its most famous; titled "Clair de lune", meaning moonlight. It was written with Paul Verlaine's poem of the same name in mind. It is mostly played pianissimo and is in D-flat major.

[edit] Passepied
The fourth and final movement of Suite Bergamasque is Passepied. A passepied is a type of dance which originated in Brittany, and means "pass foot". Debussy's Passepied is a happy, yet strangely mediaeval piece which is surpisingly fast. Throughout the piece is played a staccatto in the left hand.
