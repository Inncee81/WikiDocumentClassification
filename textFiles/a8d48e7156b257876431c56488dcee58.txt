This article deals with the Flower of Life in real-world references. For the same-named flower in fiction, see Flower of Life (fiction).



The Flower of Life.


The Flower of Life is the modern name given to a geometrical figure composed of multiple evenly-spaced, overlapping circles, that are arranged so that they form a flower-like pattern with a sixfold symmetry like a hexagon. The center of each circle is on the circumference of six surrounding circles of the same diameter.
It is considered by some to be a symbol of sacred geometry, said to contain ancient, religious value depicting the fundamental forms of space and time.[1][2][3][4] In this sense, it is a visual expression of the connections life weaves through all sentient beings, believed to contain a type of Akashic Record of basic information of all living things.[5]
There are many spiritual beliefs associated with the Flower of Life; for example, depictions of the five Platonic Solids are found within the symbol of Metatron's Cube, which may be derived from the Flower of Life pattern. These platonic solids are geometrical forms which are said to act as a template from which all life springs.
Another notable example of that which may be derived from the Flower of Life is the Tree of Life[citation needed]. This has been an important symbol of sacred geometry for many people from various religious backgrounds. Particularly, the teachings of the Kabbalah have dealt intricately with the Tree of Life[citation needed].
According to Drunvalo Melchizedek, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the stages which construct the Seed of Life are said to represent the seven days of Creation, in which Elohim (God/concept of divinity) created life; Genesis 2:2-3, Exodus 23:12, 31:16-17, Isaiah 56:6-8. Within these stages, among other things, are the symbols of the Vesica Piscis (an ancient religious symbol) and Borromean rings (which represents the Holy Trinity).[1][2]

[edit] Symbolism and nomenclature


These are not words I'm making up, these are the actual words that were used in ancient times to describe this. I think they called it the Flower of Life because it looks like a flower and because it [represents] the laws and proportions for everything alive and even not alive; everything that's manifested.

—Drunvalo Melchizedek, speaking in a video of a presentation on the FOL.

[6] 
[edit] Occurrences
The Flower of Life has represented important meaning to many people throughout history. It can be found in the temples, art, and manuscripts of cultures from all over the world. The following are some of the locations in which the Flower of Life symbol has been sighted.

Egypt - The Temple of Osiris in Abydos[4][7][8][9] [10] and at Mount Sinai.[9]
Hungary - Magyarország - Carphatians.[11]
Israel - Masada[9]
China - The Forbidden City[7] and various temples.[9]
Japan - Various temples.[9]
India[9] - The Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple), Hampi, and the temples at Ajanta.[7]
Turkey - Various old Roman sites.[7]
Spain[7][9]
Austria[7]
Italy - Italian art from the 13th century (Wolfram 2002, p. 43).[8]
North Africa - Morocco[7]
Middle East - Lebanon and various Islamic mosques.[7]
South America - Peru[7]
North America - Mexico[7]





The Flower of Life symbol drawn in red ocre Temple of Osiris at Abydos, Egypt.



[edit] Egypt, the oldest known example
The Temple of Osiris at Abydos, Egypt contains the oldest known examples of the Flower of Life.[3][10] Precisely how old these inscriptions are is unknown. Suggestions that they are over 6,000 years old[7][8][9][12][13] and may date back to as long ago as 10,500 B.C. or earlier are entirely speculative and not based on any factual reality. [14][15] The most recent research [16] shows that these symbols can be no earlier than 535 B.C. and most probably date to between the 2nd and 4th century AD, based upon photographic evidence of Greek text, still to be fully deciphered, seen alongside the Flower of Life circles and the position of the circles close to the top of columns, which are over 4 metres in height. This suggests the Osirion was half filled with sand prior to the circles being drawn and therefore likely to have been well after the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty.[16]
Possibly five Flower of Life patterns can be seen on one of the granite columns and a further five on a column opposite of the Osirion. Some are very faint and hard to distinguish. They have not been carved into the granite being drawn in red ochre with careful precision.[16]

[edit] Christianity
Christianity has many symbolic connections to the Flower of Life. Most notably, the Seed of Life and components within the Seed of Life have strong Christian meaning to them. Such components are the Spherical Octahedron, Vesica Piscis, Tripod of Life, and Tree of Life. Also the symbol of Metatron's Cube is delineated by a component of the Flower of Life and has appeared in Christian art.

[edit] Kabbalah / Judaism
The Kabbalah, which has historically been studied by the followers of Judaism, holds some symbolic connections to the Flower of Life[citation needed].
The symbol of the Tree of Life, which may be derived from the design of the Flower of Life, is studied as part of the teachings of the Kabbalah.[17]
Additionally, the symbol of Metatron's Cube, found by connecting the centers of each circle in the Fruit of Life, is seen in early Kabbalist scriptures[citation needed].

[edit] New Age
In New Age thought, the Flower of Life has provided what is considered to be deep spiritual meaning and forms of enlightenment to those who have studied it as sacred geometry.[1][2] There are groups of people all over the world who derive particular beliefs and forms of meditation based (at least in part) on the Flower of Life. FlowerofLife.org, for example, coordinates workshops at locations all over the world, in which they teach their New Age beliefs, methods, and interpretations of the Flower of Life.[1][2][18]

[edit] Other religions
The concept of the Tree of life has been adopted by some Hermeticists and pagans. The symbol of the Tree of Life may be derived from the Flower of Life[citation needed].
One of the earliest known occurrences of the Vesica Piscis, and perhaps first, was among the Pythagoreans, who considered it a holy figure[citation needed]. The Vesica Piscis is a basic component of the Flower of Life.

[edit] Alchemy
Components of the Flower of Life have been a part of the work of Alchemists. Metatron's Cube is a symbol derived from the Flower of Life which was used as a containment circle or creation circle.

Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of the Flower of Life






Leonardo da Vinci's drawings derived from the Flower of Life



[edit] Leonardo da Vinci
Leonardo da Vinci studied the Flower of Life's form and its mathematical properties. He drew the Flower of Life itself, as well as various components such as the Seed of Life. He drew geometric figures representing shapes such as the platonic solids, a sphere, a torus, etc., and also used the golden ratio of phi in his artwork; all of which may be derived from the Flower of Life design. [2][5][19][20][21][22][23][24]




Emblem of the Parc naturel régional du Queyras



[edit] Miscellaneous
In some renditions, the rosette on the unofficial flag of Padania is a symbol taken from the Flower of Life pattern.
Also a minor rosette of the Flower of Life was used for the US Television series Charmed. The symbol used is a wiccan form of the flower of life and consists of three intersecting circles. (See tripod of life)
A rosette from the Flower of Life is also used as a basis for traditional Pennsylvania Dutch building ornamentation (see Folk Art of Rural Pennsylvania by Frances Lichten, 1946).
The Queyras Park logo also bears a rosette taken from the Flower of Life.

[edit] Sacred geometry
Main article: Sacred geometry
Sacred geometry can be described as a belief system attributing a religious or cultural value to many of the fundamental forms of space and time. According to this belief system, the basic patterns of existence are perceived as sacred because in contemplating them one is contemplating the origin of all things. By studying the nature of these forms and their relationship to each other, one may seek to gain insight into the scientific, philosophical, psychological, aesthetic and mystical laws of the universe.[25][26]
The Flower of Life is considered to be a symbol of sacred geometry, said to contain ancient, religious value depicting the fundamental forms of space and time.[1][2][3][4] In this sense, it is a visual expression of the connections life weaves through all mankind, believed by some to contain a type of Akashic Record of basic information of all living things.[5]

[edit] Composition
There are many symbols found within the Flower of Life's design, each believed to possess significant meaning.

[edit] Seed of Life




The Seed of Life (a component of the Flower of Life)


The "Seed of Life" is formed from seven circles being placed with sixfold symmetry, forming a pattern of circles and lenses, which acts as a basic component of the Flower of Life's design. [1][8][27][28]
According to some[who?], the Seed of Life is a symbol of depicting the seven days of creation in which God created life; Genesis 2:2-3, Exodus 23:12, 31:16-17, Isaiah 56:6-8. The first day is believed to be the creation of the Vesica Piscis, then the creation of the Tripod of Life on the second day, followed by one sphere added for each subsequent day until all seven spheres construct the Seed of Life on the sixth day of Creation. The seventh day is the day of rest, known as the "Sabbath" or "Shabbat." [1][7][28]
In the 13th century, a Cabalist group from France succeeded, through geometric interpretation, in dividing the entire Hebrew alphabet into an order using the Seed of Life. The resulting alphabet was remarkably similar to that of the Religious sage Rashi who wrote his commentaries on the Old Testament at that time in France. [28]







Octahedron (Animation)



[edit] Spherical octahedron
The first step in forming the Seed of Life (or Flower of Life) is to begin with a circle (as in a 2D model) or a sphere (as in a 3D model).[1]
According to some religious beliefs[who?], the first step in building the Seed of Life was the creation of the octahedron by a divine "creator" (or "god"). The next step was for the creator to spin the shape on its axes. In this way a sphere is formed (see diagram). The creator's consciousness is said to exist within the sphere and the only thing that physically exists is the membrane of the sphere itself. This "first step" is not to be confused with the "first day," the latter being in reference to the seven days of creation. [1][7][28]




The vesica piscis



[edit] Vesica Piscis
Main article: Vesica piscis
The Vesica Piscis is formed from two intersecting circles of the same diameter, where the center of each circle is on the circumference of the opposite circle.[1][27] Its design is one of the simplest forms of sacred geometry. It has been depicted around the world at sacred sites, most notably at the Chalice Well in Glastonbury, England [29], and has been the subject of mystical speculation at several periods of history.[30] One of the earliest known occurrences of the Vesica Piscis, and perhaps first, was among the Pythagoreans, who considered it a holy figure.[30]
According to some religious beliefs[who?], the Vesica Piscis represents the second stage in the creation of the Seed of Life, in that it was constructed by "the Creator" (or "God") through the creation of a second Spherical Octahedron joined with the first. It is said that the Creator's consciousness began inside the first sphere and journeyed outside the surface of that sphere to create the second. Purportedly in reference to this, the Old Testament refers to "the spirit of the Creator floating upon the face of the waters."[7][28]
Continuing with these beliefs[who?], God is said to have created light through the creation of the second sphere (or Vesica Piscis). "Let there be light" is a relevant excerpt from the Old Testament. The pattern of the Vesica Piscis is said to be a geometric formula which represents the electromagnetic spectrum of light. For further information on how this can be done, see Drunvalo Melchizedek's book, The Ancient Secret of The Flower of Life.[1][2][7][28]
The Vesica Piscis has been called a symbol of the fusion of opposites and a passageway through the world’s apparent polarities.[31] It has also been noted as the geometry for the human eye.[31] It is also known to be the basis for the Ichthys fish, which is a Christian symbol representing "The Son," Jesus Christ.[32]




The Tripod of Life, representing the Holy Trinity.



[edit] Tripod of Life / Borromean rings
Main article: Borromean rings
The "Tripod of Life" (also known as "Borromean rings") is formed from a third circle being added to the Vesica Piscis, where the third circle's center point is placed at the intersection of the first two circles' circumferences.[1][29] To some[who?], it represents the mind, body, and spirit.[5] Most notably, in (Christian) religion, the Tripod of Life symbolizes the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of the Holy Trinity.[33][34]

[edit] Tube Torus




The geometric figure of a Tube Torus represented by the Seed of Life.


Main article: Torus
A basic one dimensional depiction of the "Tube Torus" shape is formed by ratcheting the Seed of Life and duplicating the lines in its design. In Physics, the Tube Torus is considered a basic structure in the study of Vortex forms. Some[who?] say the Tube Torus contains a code of vortex energy that describes light and language in a unique way, perhaps as something of an Akashic Record.[4][27]

[edit] Egg of Life

The "Egg of Life" symbol is composed of seven circles taken from the design of the Flower of Life.[1][35]
The shape of the Egg of Life is said to be the shape of a multi-cellular embryo in its first hours of creation.[4][36]
Derived from the Egg of Life is the basis for the following geometrical figures.[35]

Cube - One of the platonic solids.
Tetrahedron - One of the platonic solids.
Star Tetrahedron - Much like the Jewish Star of David.



[edit] Fruit of Life
The "Fruit of Life" symbol is composed of 13 circles taken from the design of the Flower of Life.[1][37]
The Fruit of Life is said to be the blueprint of the universe, containing the basis for the design of every atom, molecular structure, life form, and everything in existence.[1][28] It contains the geometric basis for the delineation of Metatron's Cube, which brings forth the platonic solids.




Metatron's Cube



[edit] Metatron's Cube
The Fruit of Life pattern contains the basis for the layout of Metatron's Cube. The Fruit of Life has thirteen circles. If each circle's centre is considered a "node", and each node is connected to each other node with a single line, a total of seventy-eight lines are created, forming a type of cube. Within this cube, many other shapes can be found, including two-dimensionally flattened versions of the five platonic solids. However, as can been seen by the illustrations below, the points of intersection in a flattened Dodecahedron don't conform to the nodes of the circles, and thus the shape doesn't conform to Metatron's cube as the other shapes do. This is because the Dodecahedron is formed by rotating the overall cube, which is a 3-dimensional object. By dividing the sides using the Golden Ratio, one can draw in the lines needed to form the Dodecahedron on the 2-dimensional cube.[1][5][37][38][39]
In early Kabbalist scriptures, Metatron supposedly forms the cube from his soul. This cube can later be seen in Christian art, where it appears on his chest or floating behind him. Metatron's cube is also considered a holy glyph, and was often drawn around an object or person to ward off demons and satanic powers. This idea is also present in alchemy, in which the cube was favoured as a containment circle or creation circle. [38][39]




[edit] Platonic solids
Metatron's Cube is a template that delineates the Platonic solids. In Geometry, a Platonic solid is a convex regular polyhedron. These are the three-dimensional analogs of the regular polygons. There are precisely five such figures (shown above). The name of each figure is derived from the number of its faces: respectively 4, 6, 8, 12 and 20. They are unique in that the sides, edges and angles are all congruent.[1][40]
Due to their aesthetic beauty and symmetry, the Platonic solids have been a favorite subject of geometers for thousands of years. They are named for the ancient Greek philosopher Plato who claimed the classical elements were constructed from the regular solids.[40]
[41][42][43][44][45][46]

[edit] Tree of Life




The Tree of Life derived from the Flower of Life.


Main article: Tree of life
The symbol of the Tree of Life may be derived from the Flower of Life. The Tree of Life is a mystical concept, a metaphor for common descent, and a motif in various world theologies and philosophies.[47] This mystical concept has historically been adopted by some Christians, Jews, Hermeticists, and pagans.[48] Along with the Seed of Life it is believed to be part of the geometry that parallels the cycle of the fruit tree. This relationship is implied when these two forms are superimposed upon each other.[31]
The Tree of Life is most widely recognized as a mystical concept within the Kabbalah, which is used to understand the nature of God and the manner in which He created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing). The Kabbalists developed this concept into a full model of reality, using the tree to depict a "map" of creation. The tree of life has been called the "cosmology" of the Kabbalah.[48]
Some believe the Tree of Life of Kabbalah corresponds to the Tree of Life mentioned in Genesis 2:9.[48]

[edit] Drawing
A Flower of Life pattern can be constructed with a pen, compass and paper, by creating multiple series of interlinking circles. [29]
