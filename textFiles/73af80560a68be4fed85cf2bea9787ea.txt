Cooperative learning was proposed in response to traditional curriculum-driven education. In cooperative learning environments, students interact in purposely structured heterogeneous groups to support the learning of oneself and others in the same group.
In online education, cooperative learning focuses on opportunities to encourage both individual flexibility and affinity to a learning community (Paulsen 2003). Cooperative learning seeks to foster some benefits from the freedom of individual learning and other benefits from collaborative learning. Cooperative learning thrives in virtual learning environments that emphasize individual freedom within online learning communities.

Cooperative learning explicitly builds cooperation skills by assigning roles to team members and establishing norms for conflict resolution via arbitration. Cooperative learning should also provide the means for group reflection and individual self-assessment.

"Cooperative learning (CL) is an instructional paradigm in which teams of students work on structured tasks (e.g., homework assignments, laboratory experiments, or design projects) under conditions that meet five criteria: positive interdependence, individual accountability, face-to-face interaction, appropriate use of collaborative skills, and regular self-assessment of team functioning. Many studies have shown that when correctly implemented, cooperative learning improves information acquisition and retention, higher-level thinking skills, interpersonal and communication skills, and self-confidence (Johnson, Johnson, and Smith, 1998)."

[edit] Three Theoretical Perspectives

Behavioral

Groups stimulate and punish
Groups offer more pros than they do cons.


Cognitive / Constructivist

Knowledge and Learning are social in nature.
Learning comes from figuring out unexpected occurrences together.


Social Interdependence

Cooperative

Group as a 'dynamic whole'
Positive Tension
High levels of interaction


Competitive

Negative Tension






[edit] Grouping
Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous Grouping

Heterogeneous Groups

High Achievers never lose
Usually better
Male/Female pairs most off task


Homogeneous Groups

Low Achievers fastest to quit
More interaction in all female groups than all male



Benefits of Cooperative Grouping

Increased Self Efficacy
Increased Retention
Higher Motivation
Preference for Future Coop-Learning Episodes

Building Better Groups

Outcome Interdependence

Goal attainment depends on group


Means Interdependence

Members carry out vital, distinct yet overlapping roles


Individual Accountability

Feedback from members
When needed assistance
Reassign tasks to promote balance


Task Complexity

Task is too complex for any single member to complete it.



Cooperative vs. Competitive Learning

In Cooperative Learning, learners must work together in order to succeed and personal success only springs from group success.
In Competitive Learning, in order to succeed, other learners must fail.
