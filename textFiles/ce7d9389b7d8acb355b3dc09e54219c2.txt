The BibTeX logo


BibTeX is Reference management software for formatting lists of references. The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation system. Within the typesetting system, its name is styled as .
BibTeX was created by Oren Patashnik and Leslie Lamport in 1985. BibTeX makes it easy to cite sources in a consistent manner, by separating bibliographic information from the presentation of this information. This same principle of separation of content and presentation/style is used by LaTeX itself.

[edit] Bibliographic information file
BibTeX uses a style-independent text-based file format for lists of bibliography items, such as articles, books, theses. BibTeX bibliography files usually end in .bib.
Bibliography entries each contain some subset of standard data entries:

address: Publisher's address (usually just the city, but can be the full address for lesser-known publishers)
annote: An annotation for annotated bibliography styles (not typical)
author: The name(s) of the author(s) (in the case of more than one author, separated by and)
booktitle: The title of the book, if only part of it is being cited
chapter: The chapter number
crossref: The key of the cross-referenced entry
edition: The edition of a book, long form (such as "first" or "second")
editor: The name(s) of the editor(s)
eprint: A specification of an electronic publication, often a preprint or a technical report
howpublished: How it was published, if the publishing method is nonstandard
institution: The institution that was involved in the publishing, but not necessarily the publisher
journal: The journal or magazine the work was published in
key: A hidden field used for specifying or overriding the alphabetical order of entries (when the "author" and "editor" fields are missing). Note that this is very different from the key (mentioned just after this list) that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry.
month: The month of publication (or, if unpublished, the month of creation)
note: Miscellaneous extra information
number: The "number" of a journal, magazine, or tech-report, if applicable. (Most publications have a "volume", but no "number" field.)
organization: The conference sponsor
pages: Page numbers, separated either by commas or double-hyphens. For books, the total number of pages.
publisher: The publisher's name
school: The school where the thesis was written
series: The series of books the book was published in (e.g. "The Hardy Boys" or "Lecture Notes in Computer Science")
title: The title of the work
type: The type of tech-report, for example, "Research Note"
url: The WWW address
volume: The volume of a journal or multi-volume book
year: The year of publication (or, if unpublished, the year of creation)

In addition, each entry contains a key that is used to cite or cross-reference the entry. This key is the first item in a BibTeX entry, and is not part of any field.

[edit] Entry Types
Bibliography entries included in a .bib file are split by types. The following types are understood by virtually all BibTeX styles:

An article from a journal or magazine.
Required fields: author, title, journal, year
Optional fields: volume, number, pages, month, note, key

A book with an explicit publisher.
Required fields: author/editor, title, publisher, year
Optional fields: volume, series, address, edition, month, note, key, pages
booklet

Required fields: title
Optional fields: author, howpublished, address, month, year, note, key
conference
The same as inproceedings, included for Scribe compatibility.
Required fields: author, title, booktitle, year
Optional fields: editor, pages, organization, publisher, address, month, note, key
inbook
A part of a book, usually untitled. May be a chapter (or section or whatever) and/or a range of pages.

A document having an author and title, but not formally published.
Required fields: author, title, note
Optional fields: month, year, key


[edit] Style files
BibTeX formats bibliographic items according to a style file, typically by generating TeX or LaTeX formatting commands. However, style files for generating HTML output also exist. BibTeX style files, for which the suffix .bst is common, are written in a simple, stack-based programming language that describes how bibliography items should be formatted. There are some packages which can generate .bst files automatically (like custom-bib or Bib-it).
Most journals or publishers that support LaTeX often have a customized bibliographic style file for the convenience of the authors. This ensures that the bibliographic style meets the guidelines of the publisher with minimal effort.


[edit] Examples
A .bib file might contain the following entry, which describes a mathematical handbook:

@Book{abramowitz+stegun,
  author    =     "Milton Abramowitz and Irene A. Stegun",
  title     =      "Handbook of Mathematical Functions with
                  Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables",
  publisher =      "Dover",
  year      =      1964,
  address   =     "New York",
  edition   =     "ninth Dover printing, tenth GPO printing"
}

If a document references this handbook, the bibliographic information may be formatted in different ways depending on which citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago etc.) is employed. The way LaTeX deals with this is by specifying \cite commands and the desired bibliography style in the LaTeX document. If the command \cite{abramowitz+stegun} appears inside a LaTeX document, the bibtex program will include this book in the list of references for the document and generate appropriate LaTeX formatting code. When viewing the formatted LaTeX document, the result might look like this:

Abramowitz, Milton and Irene A. Stegun (1964), Handbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables. New York: Dover.

Depending on the style file, BibTeX may rearrange authors' last names, change the case of titles, omit fields present in the .bib file, format text in italics, add punctuation, etc. Since the same style file is used for an entire list of references, these are all formatted consistently with minimal effort required from authors or editors.

[edit] Author formatting
Last name prefixes such as von, van and der are handled automatically, provided they are in lower case to distinguish them from middle names. Multiple word last names are distinguished from first and middle names by placing the last names first, then a comma, then the first and middle names. Name suffixes such as Jr., Sr., and III are generally handled by using two comma separators as in the following example:

@Book{hicks2001,
  author    =     "von Hicks, III, Michael",
  title     =      "Design of a Carbon Fiber Composite Grid Structure for the GLAST 
                 Spacecraft Using a Novel Manufacturing Technique",
  publisher =      "Stanford Press",
  year      =      2001,
  address   =   "Palo Alto",
  edition   =     "1st,",
  isbn      =   "0-69-697269-4"
}

If the author does not use a comma to separate the name suffix from the last name, then curly brackets {Hicks III} may be used instead.
Multiple authors should be separated with an and, not with commas:

 @Book{Torre2008,
    author = "Joe Torre and Tom Verducci",
    publisher = "Doubleday",
    title = "The Yankee Years",
    year = 2008,
    isbn = "0385527403"
 }


[edit] Cross-referencing
BibTeX allows referring to other publications via the crossref field. In the following example the 'author:06' publication references to 'conference:06'.

@INPROCEEDINGS {author:06,
  title    = {Some publication title},
  author   = {First Author and Second Author},
  crossref = {conference:06},
  pages    = {330--331},
}
@PROCEEDINGS {conference:06,
  editor    = {First Editor and Second Editor},
  title     = {Proceedings of the Xth Conference on XYZ},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the Xth Conference on XYZ},
  year      = {2006},
  month     = {October},
}

Remember to add booktitle to the proceedings entry in order to avoid 'empty booktitle' BibTex warning. The LaTeX output of this input might look like:

Author, First and Author, Second (October 2006), Some publication title, in: Proceedings of the Xth Conference on XYZ, pp 330-331.
