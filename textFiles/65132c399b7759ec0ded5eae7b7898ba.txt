OpenCms is an open source content management system[1] written in Java.[2][3] It is distributed by Framfab and Alkacon Software under the LGPL license.[4] OpenCms requires a JSP Servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.[4]
It is a CMS application with a browser-based work environment, asset management, user management, workflow management, a WYSIWYG editor, internationalization support, content versioning, and more features.[2]
OpenCms was launched in 1999,[4] based on its closed-source predecessor MhtCms. The first open source version was released in 2000.
OpenCms has been used by large organizations such as the LGT Bank of Lichtenstein, BP South Africa, and UNICEF Netherlands.[4]
