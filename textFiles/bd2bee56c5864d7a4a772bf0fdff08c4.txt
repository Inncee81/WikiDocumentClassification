In logic, a set of symbols is commonly used to express logical representation. As logicians are familiar with these symbols, they are not explained each time they are used. So, for students of logic, the following table lists many common symbols together with their name, pronunciation and related field of mathematics. Additionally, the third column contains an informal definition, and the fourth column gives a short example.
Be aware that, outside of logic, different symbols have the same meaning, and the same symbol has, depending on the context, different meanings.

Note: This article contains special characters.

⇒

→

⊃

material implication
A ⇒ B means if A is true then B is also true; if A is false then nothing is said about B.

→ may mean the same as ⇒ (the symbol may also indicate the domain and codomain of a function; see table of mathematical symbols).

⊃ may mean the same as ⇒ (the symbol may also mean superset).
x = 2  ⇒  x2 = 4 is true, but x2 = 4   ⇒  x = 2 is in general false (since x could be −2).

[edit] Advanced and Rarely Used Logical symbols
These symbols are sorted by their Unicode value:

x00b7 ·: Center dot, an outdated way for denoting AND, for example "A·B" is the same as "A&B"
·: Center dot with a line above it (using HTML style). Outdated way for denoting NAND, for example "A·B" is the same as "A NAND B" or "A|B" or "¬(A & B)" See also Unicode "Dot operator" x22c5


x0305 ̅ : overline, used as abbreviation for standard numerals. for example, using HTML style "4" is a shorthand for the standard numeral "SSSS0"
̅ : overline, an outdated way for denoting negation, for example "AVB" is the same as "¬(AVB)"
̅ : overline, a rarely used format for denoting Gödel numbers, for example "AVB" says the Gödel number of "(AVB)"


x2191 ↑ or 0x007c | : Sheffer stroke, the sign for the NAND operator.
x2201 ∁: complement
x2204 ∄: strike out existential quantifier same as "¬∃"
x2234 ∴: therefore
x2235 ∵: because
x22a7 ⊧: is a model of
x22a8 ⊨: is true of
x22ac ⊬: strike out turnstile, the sign for "does not prove", for example T⊬P says "P is not a theorem of T"
x22ad ⊭: is not true of
x22bc ⊼: Another NAND operator, can also be rendered as ∧
x22bd ⊽: Another NOR operator, can also be rendered as V
x22c4 ◊: modal operator for "it is possible that", "it is not necessarily not" or rarely "it is not provable not" (in most modal logics it is defined as "¬◻¬")
x22c6 ⋆: Star operator, usually used for ad-hoc operators
x22a5 ⊥ or x2193 ↓ : Webb-operator or Peirce arrow, the sign for NOR, confusingly, "⊥"is also the sign for contradiction or absurdity.


x2310 ⌐  : reversed not sign


x231c⌜ x231d ⌝: corner quotes, also called "Quine quotes"; the standard symbol used for denoting Gödel number; for example "⌜G⌝" denotes the Gödel number of G. (Typographical note: although the quotes appears as a "pair" in unicode (231C and 231D), they are not symmetrical in some fonts. And in some fonts (for example Arial) they are only symmetrical in certain sizes. Alternatively the quotes can be rendered as ⌈⌉ and (unicode 2308 and 2309) or by using a negation symbol and a reversed negation symbol ⌐ ¬ in superscript mode. )


x25fb ◻ or x25a1 □: modal operator for "it is necessary that" (in modal logic), or "it is provable that" (in provability logic), or "it is obligatory that" (in Deontic logic), or "It is believed that" (in Doxastic logic). Typographical note: there are many different "box" signs in unicode, some are NOT rendered as a box in non-western fonts. When using the modal operator in Web pages, it is important to specify the font.

Note that the following operators are rarely supported by natively installed fonts. If you wish to use these in a web page, you should always embed the necessary fonts so the page viewer can see the web page without having the necessary fonts installed in their computer.

x27e1 ⟡:modal operator for never
x27e2 ⟢: modal operator for was never
x27e3 ⟣: modal operator for will never be
x27e4 ⟤: modal operator for was always
x27e5 ⟥: modal operator for will always be


x297d ⥽: right fishtail sign, sometimes used for "relation", also used for denoting various ad hoc relations (for example, for denoting "witnessing" in the context of Rosser's trick) See here for an image of glyph. Added to Unicode 3.2.0 .

[edit] Special characters
Technical note: Due to technical limitations, some browsers may not display the special characters in this article. Some characters may be rendered as boxes, question marks, or other symbols, depending on your browser, operating system, and installed fonts. Even if you have ensured that your browser is interpreting the article as UTF-8 encoded and you have installed a font that supports a wide range of Unicode, such as Code2000, Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode or one of the free software Unicode fonts, you may still need to use a different browser, as browser capabilities vary in this regard.

^ Although this character is available in LaTeX, the Mediawiki TeX system doesn't support this character.
