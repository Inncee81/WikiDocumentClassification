[edit] Design
Comic Book Archive files mainly consist of a series of image files, typically PNG or JPEG files, compressed using one of several popular methods. The file extension indicates the archive format used:

.cbr → RAR
.cbz → ZIP

Rare:

.cb7 → 7z
.cbt → TAR
.cba → ACE

Occasionally GIF, BMP, and TIFF files are seen. The file names inside an archive are usually numbered in ascending order according to the original page number.

[edit] Adoption
Comic Book Archive viewers offer various dedicated functions to read the content, like one page forward/backwards, go to first/last page, zoom or print.
CDisplay was the first application to support the CBR format. CDisplayEx, a free and open source clone of CDisplay, expands upon many features of the original CDisplay. For users of the GNOME desktop environment, the Evince document viewer includes support for the format and users of the KDE 4 desktop environment can use Okular. Comical and Comix are other easy-to-use GUI comic book viewers . For Mac OS X, several reader programs are available, including FFView [1], Jomic[2], and ComicBookLover, an iTunes-like application for CBR and CBZ archives. The Mac OS X image viewer Xee also supports both Comic Book Archive formats.

[edit] Notable examples
The following comics are Creative Commons and can be used to test Comic Book Archive viewers.

Cory Doctorow's Futuristic Tales Of The Here And Now by Cory Doctorow and various artists (IDW Publishing, 2008). Available in cbr.
Misery Depot by Hermes Pique and Juan Romera (Papyrus Comics, 2008). Available in cbr and cbz in various languages.
Therefore Repent! by Jim Munroe and Salgood Sam
