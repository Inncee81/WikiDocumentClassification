From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

For other uses, see All Tomorrow's Parties (disambiguation).
All Tomorrow's Parties is a music festival which takes place in England at Camber Sands holiday camp in East Sussex and Butlin's holiday camp in Minehead, Somerset.
Named after a song by The Velvet Underground, it was founded by Barry Hogan in 1999 as an alternative to larger, more corporate festivals like Reading or Glastonbury, with a tendency towards post-rock, avant-garde, and underground hip hop, along with more traditional rock fare, but presented in an environment more intimate than a giant stadium or huge country field. ATP is a sponsorship free festival where the organisers and artists stay in the same accommodation as the fans.
The festival has its origins in the Bowlie Weekender, curated by Belle & Sebastian at Camber Sands in April 1999. Artists, usually musicians (but sometimes visual artists like Matt Groening or Jake and Dinos Chapman) are asked to curate the festival by inviting their favourite performers to play. The idea is that it is akin to dipping into the curator's record collection, or as Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth described it, "It's the ultimate mix tape". Steve Albini, a curator in 2002, has been quoted as stating that "There are three things in the world that I endorse: Abbey Road ... Nutter Butter Sandwich Cookies; and All Tomorrow's Parties."

Past All Tomorrow's Parties lineups

In 2002 the festival expanded to the USA, and several events have taken place there in subsequent years. In recent years the ATP organisation has also been involved in booking stages at the Pitchfork Music Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona. In 2008 ATP ran their first East-Coast US. festival, which took place at the Kutshers Country Club, Monticello, New York on September 19-21 and was a huge success. Tickets for a followup event taking place at the same location in September 2009 are on sale now from the ATP site. In January 2009 the festival took place for the first time in Australia, with events in Brisbane, Sydney and Mt Buller (in Victoria) all curated by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds.
The small organisation that puts on these festivals also promote concerts in London and the rest of the United Kingdom, curate the yearly Don't Look Back concert series and run the record label ATP Recordings.
