Yahoo! Pipes is a web application from Yahoo! that provides a graphical user interface for building data mashups that aggregate web feeds, web pages, and other services, creating Web-based apps from various sources, and publishing those apps. The site works by letting users "pipe" information from different sources and then set up rules for how that content should be modified (e.g. filtering). A typical example is New York Times through Flickr.,[1] a pipe which takes The New York Times RSS feed and adds a photo from Flickr based on the keywords of each item. The site is currently in beta.

[edit] History
Yahoo! Pipes was released to the public in beta on the 7 February 2007. It was built by Pasha Sadri, Ed Ho, Jonathan Trevor, Kevin Cheng and Daniel Raffel of Yahoo! It is described by its creators as:


Pipes is a hosted service that lets you remix feeds and create new data mashups in a visual programming environment. The name of the service pays tribute to Unix pipes, which let programmers do astonishingly clever things by making it easy to chain simple utilities together on the command line.

[edit] Mashups
A Web Mashup is a Web application that combines data from more than one web data source into a single integrated Web application. Just as Unix pipes are often used to quickly combine several different data sources but are generally not sufficient to create a useful application, Yahoo! Pipes is a data mashup tool rather than a complete Mashup Editor. [2]
