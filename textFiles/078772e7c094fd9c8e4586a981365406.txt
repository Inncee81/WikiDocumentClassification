From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Walden Two (1948) is a utopian novel by behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner,[1] describing a thousand-person, rural planned community of happy, productive, and creative people. Planners and Managers govern a community requiring only four daily hours of work from each person, and that promotes the arts and applied scientific research. The community subscribe to a code of conduct based upon, and supported by, a behaviourism resembling that of author Skinner.[2]
Walden Two challenges contemporary U.S. social conventions such as the value of modern education, the effectiveness of university professors, excessive work volume, and posits a planned economy, critical of inefficient capitalism. The community's government is not democratic; children are reared communally, outside the nuclear family, and loyalty to community, instead of parents, is encouraged. Childbearing is encouraged as soon as possible, in pursuit of a great growth policy, and eugenics are considered in possibly creating a Golden Age.
Walden Two is controversial for its rejection of democracy as effective government, viable socialist economy, an atheist society, the narrow range of available emotional expression, its appeal to dictators and to emulators of T.E. Frazier, the emotionally unstable protagonist.[3]

[edit] The plot
Six visitors arrive at a thousand-person community then ten years old. A decade earlier, T.E. Frazier wrote an article asking people join him in founding a community based on philosopher H. D. Thoreau's ideas. Two soldiers, returned from the war, seek Frazier, and enlist Professor Burris's help; he finds and communicates with Frazier, then joins the visit to the community. Prof. Burris invites Prof. Augustine Castle, and, with the two soldiers, Rogers and Steve Jamnick, and their girlfriends, Mary Grove and Barbara Macklin, they visit Walden Two.
The story concerns the arguments among founder Frazier and Prof. Castle and Prof. Burris, which exposit the reasons for the community's structure, its past and its future.[citation needed] At story's end, one couple stay in the community, while the other visitors leave, however, in a sudden change of heart, Prof. Burris quits his university post and returns to the rural community.

[edit] Other utopias
The rural utopia of Walden Two is contemporary, not in the future, and is accessible via a bus-and-car voyage, unlike Thomas More’s Utopia with only a single entrance and exit from the island society. In the introduction, B.F. Skinner says his reasons for writing Walden Two were personal: [4] he read The New Atlantis, by Francis Bacon, on being told that William Shakespeare was Sir Francis Bacon [5], and his desire to describe an interesting Heaven. [6] The other utopias mentioned in the novel are Erewhon and Looking Backward.

[edit] The community
Walden Two describes a small, thousand-person planned community based upon the community posited by H. D. Thoreau and behavioural psychology. Frazier and five others are the governing Planners. The community is self-sufficient, emulating the self-sufficiency of the Walden utopia, and to allow for the experimental control of the community, as a pilot scientific experiment, however, the way things are done is changeable, if the evidence favours change.

[edit] The members
The community are happy, productive, and creative; happiness derives from the promotion of rich social relationships and family life, free affection, the creation of art, music, and literature, opportunity for games of chess and tennis, and ample rest, food, and sleep. The community is self-governed; the members subscribe to the Walden Code of self-control techniques, which allow maintaining a happy, productive life in Walden Two with minimal strain. Self-governance, however, is supplemented with community counselors who supervise behaviour and are available to help the members with their problems in following the Walden Code.

[edit] Planners, Managers, and Scientists
Walden Two has six Planners who supervise the community's success, and Managers who supervise the community's daily life. Neither the Planners nor Managers can be elected or unelected; it is unclear how they initially assumed command, except through self-selection and mutual-selection. The Planners select new Managers from among the community. There also are a few scientists conducting applied research, to test and expand the community's principles.

[edit] Novel ideas
In Walden Two, Skinner argues for a 24 hour work week - four hours a day for six days, with one day off - and argues that it would be as productive as a full time shift from all of the members in comparable jobs outside of the community.
Frazier, the community founder, argues for the elimination of lectures, traditional education, democracy, capitalism, the family, and suggests that other things, like religion, will fall away in a more ideal social setting like Walden Two.
The lecture is an 'inefficient means to transmit culture' and has been done away with in Walden Two. Traditional education is useless and is to be replaced by a practical education driven by the environment and learned as needed. Education is seen as a lifelong learning process where a “student” is free to choose what they want to learn and when it will be useful for them to learn it. By not having a structured and regimented education system learning is more meaningful and the “students” are more likely to retain the information. Democracy is an outdated and inefficient form of government which allows for the tyranny of the majority over the minority, which is not possible in Walden Two. Capitalism is wasteful, causing great duplication of effort in advertising, retailing, and so on. It also relegates the common man to a lower place for using his hands in physical labor. The family is an outdated structure, like race, which has no real meaning when examined. It is to be replaced by the more efficient community unit. Religion is a product of social anxiety which in a non-anxiety producing culture like Walden Two will 'fall away'. Throughout the book he suggests that the solution to these outdated concepts of humanity is to control human behavior using positive reinforcement.

[edit] Growth and population
The community has an aggressive growth policy fueled by members having children at a young age ('in their teens' perhaps 13 or 14), as well as recruiting visitors like the characters in the book. This growth allowed them to reach one thousand members within ten years.
The next phase of the plan is Walden Six, a community whose architecture is designed all at once. Around half of the current members of Walden Two are to leave and build, manage and live in Walden Six.
Although initially eschewing political power for 'not giving them the chance we want', Frazier outlines a policy of taking over local political structures when possible. The aggressive growth policy gives the community political power in a democracy, and it creates for the members a Walden Ticket. The Walden Ticket tells the members who to vote for in the best interest of the community.

[edit] Family
Since teen marriage is common, members are encouraged to raise children in a collective manner. One reason is to lessen the burden on the new couple. A second reason is to develop positive, parental feelings by the children for many or all adults. To this end parents aren't to single their own children out for special favors, are to give gifts and shower attention on several children as well as their own, and are to be addressed by their proper names instead of 'mother' or 'father'. This method serves the purposes of alleviating the pressure parents feel by being the sole provider for their children and strengthening the ties of the children to the community.

[edit] Clothing
An important concept to note is the concept of clothing in this story because status and clothes are related.
The women were not required to dress a certain way. It is their belief that, “Going out of style isn’t a natural process, but a manipulated change which destroys the beauty of last year’s dress in order to make it worthless” (source: Skinner 34). They wanted to avoid wasting perfectly good clothing by continuously and quick changing styles but they still wanted to look good. They strategically chose the clothing that was good for past and the future. Women did not fill their closets with party dresses because they were not practical.
It seemed as the women were dressed well. Men wore things that are considered more normal in society. According to Frazier, “Men are less dependent on clothes....” (source: Skinner 37)

[edit] Genetics and Eugenics
Frazier suggests that the community may be able to implement a policy of eugenics, where parenthood and marriage are effectively separated. Marriage would be by choice, although with the guidance of the community, and parenthood would be by plan. This policy is not in effect at the time of Burris' visit, nor is it mentioned in Skinner's follow up News from Nowhere, 1984.
Interestingly, in Walden Two Skinner speculates on the role of genetics playing a role in many areas of human behavior. This runs counter to the many accusations that his analysis rejects genetics, something he has refuted more than once.[7]

[edit] A Golden Age
Frazier indicates that the artistic productivity of the members is designed to promote a Golden Age of art, music and literature. The art mentioned is primarily painting, the music mentioned is mostly classical - Bach's B-Minor Mass and some violin with piano accompaniment - and the literature is less clear because although many books are mentioned - from Machiavelli to H.G. Wells - it would be Anthony Trollope that might be the most fitting for the category.

[edit] Socialism
The community practices total income sharing, with the members earning their living through a community accounting system-cum-currency called the labor credit. Although the labor credit is roughly one hour of work its value is adjusted up or down based on the value of the work. The value is determined in part by the popularity of the work, with unpopular work being worth more and popular work being worth less. A community member may work up to 8 hours a day if they choose only easy, popular work. If they choose unpopular work they may work less than the community 4 hour average.

[edit] Thoreau's Walden
Walden Two's title is a reference to Henry David Thoreau's book Walden. In the novel, the Walden Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau's Walden, but "with company". It is, as the book says, 'Walden for two' - meaning a community and not a place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it The Sun is but a Morning Star, a clear reference to Thoreau's Walden, but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative[8].
In reality, Thoreau's Walden experiment and the Walden Two experiment were far different in theory, outcome, and ideology. Thoreau's Walden espouses the virtues of self-reliance, while Walden Two is more collectivist in thought.

[edit] News From Nowhere, 1984
Skinner published a follow up to Walden Two in an essay titled News From Nowhere, 1984[9]. It details the discovery of Eric Blair in the community who seeks out and meets Burris, confessing his true identity as George Orwell. Blair seeks out Frazier as the 'leader' and the two have discussions which comprise the essay. Skinner, as Frazier, mentions that Walden Two has "no institutionalized system of government, religion, or economics" and relates this to the goal of 19th century anarchism. Skinner essentially posits Walden Two as a practical non-violent anarchist system.[citation needed]

[edit] Real world efforts
Many efforts to create a Walden Two in real life are detailed in Hilke Kuhlmann's Living Walden Two[10] and in Daniel W. Bjork's B.F.Skinner.
Some of them include:

1955 In New Haven, Connecticut a group led by Arthur Gladstone tries to start a community.
1966 Waldenwoods conference is held in Hartland, Michigan, comprising 83 adults and 4 children, coordinated through the Breiland list (a list of interested people who wrote to Skinner and were referred to Jim Breiland).
1966 Matthew Israel forms the Association for Social Design (ASD), to promote a Walden Two, which soon finds chapters in Los Angeles, Albuquerque, and Washington, D.C..
1967 Israel's ASD forms the Morningside House in Arlington, Massachusetts.
1967 Twin Oaks Community (web site) is started in Lousia, Virginia.
1969 Keith Miller in Lawrence, Kansas founds a 'Walden house' [11] student collective that becomes The Sunflower House 11.
1971 Roger Ulrich starts Lake Village in Michigan originally conceptualized as a 'scientific behaviorist experiment'.
1971 Los Horcones (web site), is started in Hermosillo, Mexico.
1972 Sunflower House 11 is (re)born in Lawrence, Kansas from the previous experiment.
1979 East Wind in south central Missouri.[12]
1998 Efforts by Mike Ray of Turlock, California, since 1998 to discuss and plan a community based on Walden Two. See his Walden Two web site.

Twin Oaks is detailed in Kat Kinkade's book, Twin Oaks: A Walden Two Experiment[13]. Originally started as a Walden Two community, it has since rejected its Walden Two position, however it still uses its modified Planner-Manager system as well as a system of labor credits based on the book.
Los Horcones is described as being 'Walden Two' inspired by their website, but appears to have rejected the Planner-Manager system in favor of what it describes as 'Personocracy' [14]. It is strongly Radical behaviorist though, which it claims as the basis for the title of a Walden Two community.

[edit] Cultural engineering
Skinner wrote about cultural engineering in at least two books, devoting a chapter to it in both Science and Human Behavior and Beyond Freedom and Dignity.
In Science and Human Behavior[15] a chapter is titled "Designing a Culture" and expands on this position as well as in other documents. In Beyond Freedom and Dignity there are many indirect references to Walden Two when describing other cultural designs.
For more information on cultural design today see behavioral engineering.

[edit] Criticisms
Rozycki, in his Critical Review, criticizes Walden Two for the conventional role of women in Walden Two which could be seen as sexist[16].
There seems to be this false sense of equality in the workforce. Women are primarily placed into stereotypical females roles like cooking, weaving, and being a caregiver. Males were primarily placed into stereotypical male positions like being a doctor, farmer or the operation of heavy equipment.
Hilke Kuhlmann's Living Walden Two possesses many subtle and not-so-subtle criticisms of the original Walden Two which are related to the actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism is that many of the founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic founder of the community.
Gable, Harvey L., Jr. criticizes Walden Two, saying “...this environment is a benign dictatorship, with a single person regulating all human activities in the name of serving his people.” This model community founded by T.E. Frazier is based on the principles of behavioral modification and denying the reality of nature by ignoring its existence. He uses the family structure as an example of this.
