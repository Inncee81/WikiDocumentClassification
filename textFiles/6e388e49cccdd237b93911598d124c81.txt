[edit] History
Project.net was founded in 1999 to develop project collaboration applications using Internet technologies. The company's initial focus was building and deploying a collaboration engine for use by public and private web-based exchanges. In 2002, PC Magazine awarded Project.net with the Editors' Choice award in a review of web-based project management applications.[1]
Project.net was acquired by Integrated Computer Solutions in 2006 and launched the open source version of Project.net’s project and portfolio management (PPM) application. The Open Source Business Conference awarded three open source projects (including Project.net) as "ones to watch" shortly after the acquisition.[2]
Project.net is currently used by more than 50,000 people worldwide to help manage their projects. University Business Magazine published an article on Project and Portfolio Management that reviews the need for and use of Project.net in the facilities department at Cornell University.[3]

[edit] License
Project.net is available via the GNU General Public License or a commercial license if preferred by the user. However, Project.net cannot be used without Oracle database, which is a commercial product.
