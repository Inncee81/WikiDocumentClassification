Shpongle (pronounced /ˈʃpɒŋɡəl/) is a psychedelic downtempo or Psybient music project. The core members are Simon Posford (aka Hallucinogen) and Raja Ram (one third of The Infinity Project), but they often collaborate with other artists. Their sound has sampled eastern ethnic instruments and western contemporary synthesizer-based psychedelic music. Posford is responsible for the synth and studio work while Raja Ram contributes with flute arrangements.
The name "Shpongle" is not a dictionary recognized word; it is derived from a rumor when Raja Ram was asked at a party to see how he was feeling. He replied "I feel...Shpongled.".
Shpongle's first track, Vapour Rumours, was released on TIP Records' Infinite Excursions compilation in 1996.[1] Their debut album, Are You Shpongled?, was released 1998 on Twisted Records. Are You Shpongled? and Twisted Records' first downtempo compilation, ...and the Day Turned to Night, were influential in the then-small psychedelic downtempo genre.
In January 2007, Twisted Records announced that a fourth Shpongle album was being recorded, to be released in early 2009. The current projected release date is mid November 2009.[2] The album will be named "Ineffable Mysteries from Shpongleland" and will have the catalogue number TWSCD36.[3]

[edit] Shpongle live
Shpongle have played very few full live concerts, although Simon Posford often plays Shpongle DJ sets. These DJ sets have sometimes been accompanied by Raja Ram on flute (e.g. Orchid Farm, Israel, 2002 [4] and Glastonbury Glade stage 2003), blurring the distinction between recorded and live.
Shpongle's first live performance was at the Solstice Music Festival held at Motosu Highland in Japan on 19th to 21st July 2001. Shpongle played on 21st July. [5] They returned to Japan on New Year's Eve 2003 to play the New Maps Of Hyperspace event at Tokyo Bay NK Hall together with 1200 Micrograms, featuring Raja Ram, and Hallucinogen. [6]
On January 16 2004, they played a live set in Tel Aviv, Israel. [7] As well as Simon Posford and Raja Ram, this featured Abigail Gorton (Hari Om) and Michele Adamson (credited as Michelle on the tickets) on vocals, Pete Callard on guitar, Nogera on drums and percussion, and Ott on keyboards and programming. [8]
Prior to the release of their fourth album, Shpongle played a sold out live concert at The Roundhouse venue in North London on October 31 2008. The band featured Andy Gangadeen (drums), Nogera (percussion), Chris Taylor (bass), Pete Callard (guitar), Harry Escott (cello) and Dick Trevor (keyboards and programming); Michele Adamson and Hari Om (voices), three dancers and for one song only Manu Delago on hang drum. The set list for the show was [new song], Outer Shpongolia, Levitation Nation, Dorset Perception, Periscopes of Consciousness, Schmaltz Herring, [new song], Star Shpongled Banner, My Head Feels Like a Frisbee, When Shall I Be Free?, The Stamen of the Shaman, [new song], Divine Moments of Truth, [interlude], [new song], Once Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness, Around the World in a Tea Daze [9]
This was followed on 20th December 2008 by a concert in Moscow featuring the same lineup, including Manu Delago on hang drum. Shows were also planned for March 7th and 9th 2009 in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. These were cancelled due to non-payment of the deposit by the promoters [10].
For 2009, Shpongle have announced a headlining date at the Ozora Festival held near Ozora, Hungary on 15th August 2009[11] and an album launch show at the Roundhouse on October 30th 2009[12].

[edit] Trivia

The Shpongle logo mask was designed by Sat Ram Bradley and was rebuilt in 3D by Calx Design for the later album covers.
