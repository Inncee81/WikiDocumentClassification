This is a list of currently active autonomist and secessionist movements around the world.
Entries on this list meet two criteria: they are active movements with living, active members, and they are seeking greater autonomy or self-determination for a geographic region (as opposed to personal autonomy). What is and is not considered an autonomy or secession movement is, of course, contentious.
Under each region listed is one or more of the following:

Proposed state
De-facto state (if one is already in power in the accorded region)
Political party/ies
Pressure group(s) (for non-politically-participatory entities)
Rebel organization(s) (for those organizations which have taken up arms)
Proposed autonomous region (if the above organizations have explicitly called for greater autonomy rather than outright secession; does not preclude the existence of proposed secessionist states in the same region in question)
Government-in-exile (if a government has been formed outside of the region in question due to pressure from the occupying government)

For defunct movements and groups, please see: List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements
This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
