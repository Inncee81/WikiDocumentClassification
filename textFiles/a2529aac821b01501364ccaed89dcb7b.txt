In mathematics, a real-valued function f defined on an interval (or on any convex subset of some vector space) is called convex, concave upwards, concave up or convex cup, if for any two points x and y in its domain C and any t in [0,1], we have







Convex function on an interval.


In other words, a function is convex if and only if its epigraph (the set of points lying on or above the graph) is a convex set.
Pictorially, a function is called 'convex' if the function lies below the straight line segment connecting two points, for any two points in the interval.[1]
A function is called strictly convex if



for any t in (0,1) and 
A function f is said to be concave if − f is convex.

[edit] Properties




A function (in blue) is convex if and only if the region above its graph (in green) is a convex set.


A convex function f defined on some open interval C is continuous on C and differentiable at all but at most countably many points. If C is closed, then f may fail to be continuous at the endpoints of C.
A function is midpoint convex on an interval C if



for all x and y in C. This condition is only slightly weaker than convexity. For example, a real valued Lebesgue measurable function that is midpoint convex will be convex [2]. In particular, a continuous function that is midpoint convex will be convex.
A differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its derivative is monotonically non-decreasing on that interval.
A continuously differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if the function lies above all of its tangents: f(y) ≥ f(x) + f '(x) (y − x) for all x and y in the interval. In particular, if f '(c) = 0, then c is a global minimum of f(x).
A twice differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its second derivative is non-negative there; this gives a practical test for convexity. If its second derivative is positive then it is strictly convex, but the converse does not hold. For example, the second derivative of f(x) = x4 is f "(x) = 12 x2, which is zero for x = 0, but x4 is strictly convex.
More generally, a continuous, twice differentiable function of several variables is convex on a convex set if and only if its Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite on the interior of the convex set.
Any local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum. A strictly convex function will have at most one global minimum.
For a convex function f, the sublevel sets {x | f(x) < a} and {x | f(x) ≤ a} with a ∈ R are convex sets. However, a function whose sublevel sets are convex sets may fail to be a convex function; such a function is called a quasiconvex function.
Jensen's inequality applies to every convex function f. If X is a random variable taking values in the domain of f, then  (Here E denotes the mathematical expectation.)

[edit] Convex function calculus

If f and g are convex functions, then so are m(x) = max{f(x),g(x)} and h(x) = f(x) + g(x).
If f and g are convex functions and if g is increasing, then h(x) = g(f(x)) is convex.
Convexity is invariant under affine maps: that is, if f(x) is convex with , then so is g(y) = f(Ay + b), where 
If f(x,y) is convex in (x,y) and C is a convex nonempty set, then  is convex in x, provided  for some x.


[edit] Examples

The function f(x) = x2 has  at all points, so f is a (strictly) convex function.
The absolute value function f(x) = | x | is convex, even though it does not have a derivative at the point x = 0.
The function f(x) = | x | p for 1 ≤ p is convex.
The exponential function f(x) = ex is convex. More generally, the function g(x) = ef(x) is logarithmically convex if f is a convex function.
The function f with domain [0,1] defined by f(0)=f(1)=1, f(x)=0 for 0<x<1 is convex; it is continuous on the open interval (0,1), but not continuous at 0 and 1.
The function x3 has second derivative 6x; thus it is convex on the set where x ≥ 0 and concave on the set where x ≤ 0.
Every linear transformation taking values in  is convex but not strictly convex, since if f is linear, then f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b). This statement also holds if we replace "convex" by "concave".
Every affine function taking values in , i.e., each function of the form f(x) = aTx + b, is simultaneously convex and concave.
Every norm is a convex function, by the triangle inequality.
If f is convex, the perspective function g(x,t) = tf(x / t) is convex for t > 0.
Examples of functions that are monotonically increasing but not convex include  and g(x) = log(x).
Examples of functions that are convex but not monotonically increasing include h(x) = x2 and k(x) = − x.
The function f(x) = 1/x2, with f(0)=+∞, is convex on the interval (0,+∞) and convex on the interval (-∞,0), but not convex on the interval (-∞,+∞), because of the singularity at x = 0.
