From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
New media art is an art genre that encompasses artworks created with new media technologies, including digital art, computer graphics, computer animation, virtual art, Internet art, interactive art technologies, computer robotics, and art as biotechnology. The term differentiates itself by its resulting cultural objects, which can be seen in opposition to those deriving from old media arts (i.e. traditional painting, sculpture, etc.) This concern with medium is a key feature of much contemporary art and indeed many art schools now offer a major in "New Genres" or "New Media".
New Media concerns are often derived from the telecommunications, mass media and digital modes of delivery the artworks involve, with practices ranging from conceptual to virtual art, performance to installation.

[edit] History
The origins of new media art can be traced to the moving photographic inventions of the late 19th Century such as the zoetrope (1834), the praxinoscope (1877) and Eadweard Muybridge's zoopraxiscope (1879).
During the 1960s the development of then new technologies of video produced the new media art experiments of Nam June Paik and Wolf Vostell, and multimedia performances of Fluxus. At the end of the of the 1980s the development of computer graphics, combined with real time technologies then in the 1990s with the spreading of the Web and the Internet favorished the emerging of new and various forms of interactivity Lynn Hershman Leeson, David Rokeby, Perry Hoberman, Internet Vuk Ćosić, Jodi, virtual and immmersive art Jeffrey Shaw, Maurice Benayoun and large scale urban installation Rafael Lozano-Hemmer.
Simultaneously advances in biotechnology have also allowed artists like Eduardo Kac to begin exploring DNA and genetics as a new art medium.
Contemporary New Media Art influences on new media art have been the theories developed around hypertext, databases, and networks. Important thinkers in this regard have been Vannevar Bush and Theodor Nelson with important contributions from the literary works of Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Julio Cortázar and Douglas Cooper. These elements have been especially revolutionary for the field of narrative and anti-narrative studies, leading explorations into areas such as non-linear and interactive narratives.

[edit] Themes




G.H. Hovagimyan "A Soapopera for iMacs"


In their book New Media Art, Mark Tribe and Reena Jena name several themes that contemporary new media art addresses, including computer art, collaboration, identity, appropriation and open sourcing, telepresence and surveillance, corporate parody, as well as intervention and hacktivism. (Tribe, Mark; Jena, Reena (2007-02-22). "New Media Art - Introduction". New Media Art. Taschen/Brown. https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/MarkTribe/New+Media+Art+-+Introduction. Retrieved on 2007-11-29. )
The interconnectivity and interactivity of the internet, as well as the fight between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web and continues today, fascinate and inspire a lot of current New Media Art.

[edit] Presentation & Preservation
As the technologies used to deliver works of new media art such as film, tapes, web browsers, software and operating systems become obsolete, New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to preserve artwork beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects into New media art preservation are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile media arts heritage (see DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage).
Methods of preservation exist, including the translation of a work from an obsolete medium into a related new medium,[1] the digital archiving of media (see Internet Archive), and the use of emulators to preserve work dependent on obsolete software or operating system environments.[2][3]
