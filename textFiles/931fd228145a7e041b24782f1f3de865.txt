[edit] Core Features

[edit] Browser Compatibility
TinyMCE is compatible with multiple browers across multiple Operating Systems including Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. There is limited support for Opera.[1]

[edit] API
TinyMCE v3.0 includes an extensive API for custom integration.[2]

[edit] Plugins
TinyMCE ships with an assortment of plugins.[3] Since TinyMCE is meant to be a client side application it does not include native file managers for various server technologies. Several file manager solutions exist including several proprietary projects developed by Moxiecode Systems AB, as well as a handful of open source file manager solutions.

[edit] Proprietary

MCFileManager
MCImageManager


[edit] Open Source

Ajax File Manager
TinyFCK - image manager based on the file manager packaged with FCKeditor.
TinyBrowser - file manager featuring simple multiple file upload support (uploader is Adobe Flash based).
TinyMCE CodeIgniter Media Manager (project currently on hold)
iBrowser (hasn't been updated since 2005)

IMCE - image/file uploader and browser.


[edit] Language Support

44 different translations are available for TinyMCE 2.x.x.[4]
46 different translations are available for TinyMCE 3.x.x.[5]


[edit] Product support
The Moxiecode community support for TinyMCE has been officially discontinued as mentioned in one of their forum threads [1] by developer, Afraithe. However they give the option for premium product support which requires purchasing a support account. All related bugs can be reported at their sourceforge website mentioned below in the external links.
For minor support related queries you have to refer their wiki, FAQ or their Tips, Tricks & How To's forum thread

[edit] Themes / Skins
TinyMCE offers various ways to customize the look and feel of the editor. TinyMCE is packaged with two themes, simple and advanced, as well as 2 skins for each theme, default and o2k7. A third silver theme based on the o2k7 theme is available for download from the TinyMCE SourceForge.[6]

[edit] Compressor
TinyMCE also has an optional compressor pack to reduce the overall script download footprint as well as the time it takes the script to initialize. The compressor pack is available for PHP, ASPX, JSP, and CFM. A third party Ruby on Rails compressor pack is also available.[7]
