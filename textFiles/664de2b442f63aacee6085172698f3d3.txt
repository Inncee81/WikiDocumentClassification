From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
A Service Desk is a primary IT capability called for in IT Service Management (ITSM) as defined by the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). It is intended to provide a Single Point of Contact ("SPOC") to meet the communications needs of both Users and IT and to satisfy both Customer and IT Provider objectives. ("User" refers to the actual user of the service, while "Customer" refers to the entity that is paying for service)

[edit] Objectives
The objectives of the Service Desk are:

Providing a single (informed) point of contact for customers
Facilitating the restoration of normal operational service with minimal business impact on the customer within agreed SLA levels and business priorities.

The common Service Desk functions include:

Receiving calls, first-line customer liaison
Recording and tracking incidents and complaints
Keeping customers informed on request status and progress
Making an initial assessment of requests, attempting to resolve them or refer them to someone who can
Monitoring and escalation procedures relative to the appropriate SLA
Identifying problems
Closing incidents and confirmation with the customers
Coordinating second and third line support

The Service Desk pro-actively keeps users informed of all relevant service events, actions and service changes that are likely to affect them. The Service Desk is in the direct line of any impact on the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and as such should be kept rapidly informed of any planned or unexpected changes or service unavailability.



NB: While ITIL suggests that the Service Desk is a function and not a process, it has been observed that the Service Request process followed by the service desk is in fact a process.




[edit] Alternative Titles
Many organizations have implemented a central point of contact for handling Customer, User and related issues. The Service Desk function is known under several titles (often interpreted as having increasing levels of business relevance) including:

Call center
Contact center
Help desk
Service desk


[edit] ITIL approach
The ITIL approach considers the Service Desk to be the central point of contact between service providers and users/customers on a day-to-day basis. It is also a focal point for reporting Incidents (disruptions or potential disruptions in service availability or quality) and for users making Service Requests (routine requests for services).

[edit] Other activities
The Service Desk handles incidents and service requests, as well as providing an interface to users for other ITSM activities such as:

Incident Management
Problem Management
Configuration Management
Change Management
Release Management
Service Level Management
Availability Management
Capacity Management
Financial Management
IT Service Continuity Management
Security Management



[edit] Differences from a Call Center / Contact center / Help desk
The Service Desk differs from a Call center, Contact center or a Help desk by offering a more broad and user-centric approach, which seeks to provide a user with an informed single point of contact for all of their ICT requirements. A Service Desk seeks to facilitate the integration of business processes into the Service Management infrastructure. In addition to actively monitoring and owning Incidents and user questions, and providing the communications channel for other Service Management disciplines with the user community, a Service Desk also provides an interface for other activities such as customer Change requests, third parties (e.g. maintenance contracts), and software licensing.
