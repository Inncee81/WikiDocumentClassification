The KMPlayer is a video and audio player for Microsoft Windows which can play a large number of formats such as VCD, DVD, AVI, MKV, Ogg, OGM, 3GP, MPEG-1/2/4, WMV, RealMedia, FLV and QuickTime among others. It handles a wide range of subtitles and allows one to capture audio, video, and screenshots.
The player provides both internal and external filters with a fully controlled environment in terms of connections to other splitters, decoders, audio/video transform filters and renderers without grappling with the DirectShow merit system. Interestingly, it is said that internal filters are not registered with a user's system to keep it from being messed up with system filters.
The player can set multifarious audio and video effects, slow down or increase playback speed, select parts of a video as favorites, do various A-B repeats, remap the keys of remote interface for HTPC including overlay screen controls, change a skin dynamically depending on a media type playing, and many more. The KMPlayer is completely customizable thanks to a wide selection of skins[1] and color schemes, and the configuration options are very extensive.[2]
The "K" of KMP simply indicates the initial character of the original developer's family name (Kang). The full name of KMPlayer is K-Multimedia Player. In March 2008 development has been taken over by Pandora TV, a Korean streaming video company.[2]

[edit] Controversy
Gabest, original author of Media Player Classic claimed that The KMPlayer was violating the GPL by using GPLed code written by both him and others in a closed-source program. The authors of the KMPlayer have denied this allegation; they maintain that The KMPlayer did not actually include the mentioned GPL code in the executable, and thus was not breaking any GPL rules.[3][4] Controversially, The KMPlayer was bundled with a GPL component, although when the authors were notified they deleted the GPL breaching part bundled with the program.[5] The KMPlayer is listed on FFmpeg's Hall of Shame indicating that it is violating FFmpeg's license terms by distributing binaries of software under GPL or LGPL without source.[6]
