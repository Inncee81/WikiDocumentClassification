From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Fallacies of Distributed Computing are a set of common but flawed assumptions made by programmers when first developing distributed applications. The fallacies are summarized as follows:[1]

The network is reliable.
Latency is zero.
Bandwidth is infinite.
The network is secure.
Topology doesn't change.
There is one administrator.
Transport cost is zero.
The network is homogeneous.

[edit] History
The list of fallacies generally came about at Sun Microsystems. Peter Deutsch, one of the original Sun "Fellows," is credited with penning the first seven fallacies in 1994; however, Bill Joy and Tom Lyon had already identified the first four as "The Fallacies of Networked Computing"[2] (the article claims "Dave Lyon," but this is considered a mistake). Around 1997, James Gosling, another Sun Fellow and the inventor of Java, added the eighth fallacy.[2]
