[edit] History
Tobias Ratschiller, then an IT consultant and later founder of the software company Maguma, started to work on a PHP-based web front-end to MySQL in 1998, inspired by Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. He gave up the project (and phpAdsNew, of which he was also the original author) in 2000 because of lack of time.
By that time, phpMyAdmin had already become one of the most popular PHP applications and MySQL administration tools, with a large community of users and contributors. In order to coordinate the growing number of patches, a group of three developers, Olivier Müller, Marc Delisle and Loïc Chapeaux, registered The phpMyAdmin Project at SourceForge.net and took over the development in 2001.

The software, which is currently available in 54 different languages (languages list), is still being maintained by The phpMyAdmin Project under Olivier Müller, Marc Delisle, Alexander M. Turek, Michal Čihař and Garvin Hicking.

[edit] Similar products
Another very similar tool, phpPgAdmin, provides similar functionality for PostgreSQL. It originally started as a fork of phpMyAdmin, but is now a completely different code base.
There is a tool for managing Microsoft SQL Server, called phpMSAdmin. Though it borrows design principles from phpMyAdmin, it was written entirely from scratch and includes no code from phpMyAdmin.
An equivalent product for the Microsoft SQL Server area is myLittleAdmin. The objective of the both products is the same: offering a great web interface to efficiently manage database online.
There is a similar lightweight tool for managing MySQL databases called phpMinAdmin, which has all the most important features of phpMyAdmin, but consists of only one PHP file.
