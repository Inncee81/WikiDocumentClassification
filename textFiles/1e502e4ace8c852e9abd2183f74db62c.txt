From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

SystemC is often thought of as a hardware description language like VHDL and Verilog, but is more aptly described as a system description language, since it exhibits its real power during Electronic system level Design (ESL), transaction-level modeling , behavioral modeling, and High Level Synthesis. SystemC is a set of library routines and macros implemented in C++, which makes it possible to simulate concurrent processes, each described by ordinary C++ syntax. Instantiated in the SystemC framework, the objects described in this manner may communicate in a simulated real-time environment, using signals of all the datatypes offered by C++, some additional ones offered by the SystemC library, as well as user defined.
The behaviors (processes) defined may be instantiated any number of times, and provisions are made for processes defined by hierarchies of other processes, as one would expect.
The language thus offered has semantical similarities to VHDL and Verilog, but may be said to have a syntactical overhead compared to these. On the other hand, greater freedom of expressiveness is offered in return, like object oriented design partitioning and template classes. Which is more: SystemC is both a description language and a simulation kernel. The code written will compile together with the library's simulation kernel to give an executable that behaves like the described model when it is run. The performance of this simulation kernel is not to be compared with that of commercial VHDL/Verilog simulators designed to simulate RTL level designs at the present.

[edit] History

1999-09-27 Open SystemC Initiative announced
2000-03-01 SystemC V0.91 released
2000-03-28 SystemC V1.0 released
2001-02-01 SystemC V2.0 specification and V1.2 Beta source code released
2003-06-03 SystemC 2.0.1 LRM (language reference manual) released
2005-06-06 SystemC 2.1 LRM and TLM 1.0 transaction-level modeling standard released
2005-12-12 IEEE approves the IEEE 1666–2005 standard for SystemC
2007-04-13 SystemC v2.2 released
2008-06-09 TLM 2.0 released

ARM Ltd., CoWare, Synopsys and CynApps teamed up to develop SystemC (CynApps later became Forte Design Systems) to launch it first draft version in 1999[1][2]. The chief competitor at the time was SpecC another C++ based open source package developed by UC Irvine personnel and some Japanese companies.
In June 2000, a standards group known as the Open SystemC Initiative was formed to provide an industry neutral organization to host SystemC activities and to allow Synopsys' largest competitors, Cadence and Mentor Graphics, democratic representation in SystemC development.
In July 2004, Synopsys withdraw from its engagement in SystemC.

[edit] Language Features

[edit] Modules
Modules are the basic building blocks of a SystemC design hierarchy. A SystemC model usually consists of several modules which communicate via ports. The Modules Can be Thought of a building block of systemC.

[edit] Ports
Ports allow communication from inside a module to the outside (usually to other modules).

[edit] Processes
Processes are the main computation elements. They are concurrent.

[edit] Channels
Channels are the communication elements of SystemC. They can be either simple wires or complex communication mechanisms like fifos or bus channels.
Elementary channels:

signal
buffer
fifo
mutex
semaphore


[edit] Interfaces
Ports use interfaces to communicate with channels.

[edit] Events
Allow synchronization between processes.

[edit] Data types
SystemC introduces several data types which support the modeling of hardware.
Extended standard types:

sc_int<> 64-bit signed integer
sc_uint<> 64-bit unsigned integer
sc_bigint<> arbitrary precision signed integer
sc_biguint<> arbitrary precision unsigned integer

Logic types:

sc_bit 2-valued single bit
sc_logic 4-valued single bit
sc_bv<> vector of sc_bit
sc_lv<> vector of sc_logic

Fixed point types:

sc_fixed<> templated signed fixed point
sc_ufixed<> templated unsigned fixed point
sc_fix untemplated signed fixed point
sc_ufix untemplated unsigned fixed point


[edit] Example
Example code of an adder:


#include "systemc.h"
 
SC_MODULE(adder)          // module (class) declaration
{
  sc_in<int> a, b;        // ports
  sc_out<int> sum;
 
  void do_add()           // process
  {
    sum = a + b;
  }
 
  SC_CTOR(adder)          // constructor
  {
    SC_METHOD(do_add);    // register do_add to kernel
    sensitive << a << b;  // sensitivity list of do_add
  }
};


[edit] Vendors supporting SystemC

Cadence Design Systems
Calypto
CoWare
Forte Design Systems
Jeda
Catapult C from Mentor Graphics Supports selected SystemC data types as input, and also generates SystemC for verification.
