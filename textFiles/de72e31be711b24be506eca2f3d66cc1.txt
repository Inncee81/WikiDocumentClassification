[edit] Common Features
Happy Hacking Keyboards lack a numeric keypad, and keys outside the typewriter key area are mainly accessible through the Fn key. The keys are arranged in a layout resembling the Sun Type 3 keyboard. Specifically:

The control key is found where most keyboards place the caps lock. This is the only control key on the keyboard.
The esc key is located to the left of the 1 key; the key normally found there is at the right end of the same row.
The delete key is located directly above the enter key; the key normally found there is the second rightmost key on the row above it. Furthermore, this is an actual delete key, not a historically named backspace. Backspace is accessible through Fn+Delete.
The windows/command key is located between the space bar and the alt keys, and is represented by ◊.

On the far side of the keyboard there are DIP switches. These may be used to[2]

Turn the delete key into a backspace. Fn+Delete remains backspace, and Fn + top-right key remains delete.
Swap the alt and ◊ keys
Enable/disable downstream USB ports on USB models.
