[edit] Types of business intelligence tools
The key general categories of business intelligence tools are:

Spreadsheets[1]
Reporting and querying software - are tools that extract, sort, summarize, and present selected data
OLAP
Digital Dashboards
Data mining
Process mining
Business performance management

Except for spreadsheets, these tools are sold as standalone tools, suites of tools, components of ERP systems, or as components of software targeted to a specific industry. The tools are sometimes packaged into data warehouse appliances.
