Kent Beck






Software Testing portal



Kent Beck is an American software engineer and the creator of Extreme Programming[1], developed while he was serving as project leader on Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation (C3), a long-term project for employee payroll that was canceled just under 4 years after it was started. Beck was one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto in 2001.[1]
Kent Beck has an M.S. degree in computer science from the University of Oregon. He has pioneered software design patterns, the rediscovery of Test-driven development, as well as the commercial application of Smalltalk. Beck popularized CRC cards with Ward Cunningham and along with Erich Gamma created the JUnit unit testing framework.
