The Windows Live "Orb"





Windows Live is the collective brand name for a set of services and software products from Microsoft. A majority of these services are Web applications, accessible from a browser, but there are applications that need installing as well. There are three ways in which Windows Live services are offered: Windows Live Essentials applications, web services, and mobile services.[1]
Windows Live was first announced on November 1, 2005. In its initial release, several Windows Live properties were rebranded and enhanced from Microsoft's MSN set of products and services. However, MSN still exists alongside Windows Live as a means of delivering programmed content (as opposed to customized content and communications).[2] Although the new branding might suggest closer technical ties to the Microsoft Windows operating system and services, the two are available separately. Microsoft said that Windows Live "is a way to extend the Windows user experience".[3] Windows Vista provides a link in its user interface to download Windows Live Messenger, and Windows 7 will see the removal of applications such as Windows Mail, Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Movie Maker and replaced with the Windows Live Essentials suite, a software that allows the downloading and installation of similar offerings from Windows Live.[4] Some web-based Windows Live services such as Windows Live SkyDrive are available outside of Windows, however these services are integrated closely with the Windows Live Essentials suite of applications.
Some released Windows Live services and programs include the Live Search search engine, the Windows Live Messenger instant messaging client, the Windows Live Hotmail webmail service, the Windows Live OneCare computer security service, and Windows Live Spaces.
Besides Windows Live, which is mainly aimed at individuals[2], there are some other Web properties from Microsoft that are branded as "Live": Microsoft Office Live for small businesses, the Xbox Live multiplayer gaming and content delivery system for Xbox and Xbox 360, and the Games for Windows - LIVE multiplayer gaming service for Microsoft Windows. On January 23, 2009, Microsoft announced that Office Live services will be converged into Windows Live services.[5]

[edit] Live Search




Live Search searching for "Wikipedia"


Main article: Live Search
Live Search was originally named Windows Live Search (and MSN Search prior to that) and was once part of the Windows Live family of services. It was the homepage of Live.com, the domain for all Windows Live services. However, on 2007-03-21, Microsoft has decided to separate its Live Search developments from its Windows Live services family, forming part of the Live Search and Ad Platform. Live Search will consolidate with Microsoft adCenter, a part of Microsoft's Platform and Systems division.[7]
In addition to searching webpages, other Live Search services include:

Live Search Cashback
Live Search Club
Live Search Farecast
Live Search Feeds
Live Search Health
Live Search Images
Live Search Local
Live Search Macros
Live Search Maps
Live Search News
Live Search Products
Live Search Translator
Live Search Video
Live Search xRank

Services that have been discontinued include:

Live Search Academic
Live Search Books, including Live Search Books Publisher Program

It was announced on February 18, 2009 that Live Search QnA would be rebranded as MSN QnA, moving it under the MSN umbrella of services focusing on content and community.[8]
Additionally, Live Search Webmaster Center and Live Product Upload provide content submission services to webmasters and merchants to add their contents to Live Search.

[edit] Live Mesh




Live Desktop under Live Mesh


Main article: Live Mesh
Live Mesh is a software as a service platform released on April 23, 2008 that enables PCs and other devices to connect with each other through the internet. Live Mesh is part of Live Services, one of the building blocks of Microsoft's Azure Services Platform - a "cloud" platform hosted at Microsoft data centers.[9] Live Mesh allows applications, people, and devices to be synchronized across multiple devices using FeedSync and cloud computing technologies. It is designed to give developers the ability to easily develop and scale up applications that can run on a wide variety of devices. Live Mesh currently consists of:

Mesh Operating Environment - software component that manages the synchronization relationships between devices and data
Live Desktop - online cloud storage service that allows synchronized folders to be accessible via a website
Live Mesh Remote Desktop - software that allow users to remotely connect and manage to any of the devices in a synchronization relationship
Live Framework - a REST-based application programming interface for accessing the Live Mesh services over HTTP

Features and functionalities of Live Mesh are expected to be integrated into the Windows Live "Wave 4" release.[10] The Windows Live, Live Services Platform, and Live Mesh teams was merged into a single Windows Live team in January 2009.[11]

[edit] Microsoft Live Labs
Microsoft Live Labs is a partnership between MSN and Microsoft Research that focuses on applied research for Internet products and services at Microsoft.
Live Labs are headed by Dr. Gary William Flake, who prior to joining Microsoft was a principal scientist at Yahoo! Research Lab and former head of research at the Web portal's Overture Services division.
Live Labs' focus is on applied research and practical applications of computer science areas including natural language processing, machine learning, information retrieval, data mining, computational linguistics, distributed computing, etc.[12]

[edit] Themes

[edit] Blue Vapor / Flair
Most original Windows Live applications and services used a visual theme known as Blue Vapor or Flair. While the new "Wave 2.0" header has replaced Blue Vapor on most Windows Live sites, Blue Vapor remains in use on sites such as Windows Live Favorites. An example is shown below:


[edit] Windows Live 2.0
With the public beta release of the Windows Live Wave 2.0 Suite[13] ("Wave" refers to the group or wave of products to be released), a new visual theme was released to enable the Aero transparency effect in Windows Vista.[14] An example is shown below:


[edit] Windows Live 3.0
Microsoft has released a new theme for their Windows Live Wave 3.0 services. Instead of simply changing the colour of the header, this new visual theme allows users to customize their pages on Windows Live using a set of pre-selected background pictures. Several of these themes are dynamic and will change according to the time of day and the current weather condition of the user.[15] It is currently implemented in all but a few of the services such as Windows Live Personalized Experience. An example is shown below:


[edit] Live Search
As part of Microsoft's plan to distinguish its Live Search brand from their Windows Live services, all of Live Search's services have upgraded their themes to a much different one since the codename Rome upgrade. According to the Live Search design team, the new theme reflects extensive user-centered researches which provides a "simple and powerful, human, and fast" experience.[16] An example is shown below:


[edit] Windows Live Butterfly
Microsoft has initiated the Windows Live Butterfly awards program (formerly the MSN Butterfly program), in order to recognize the contributions made by exemplary beta testers. Prospective 'butterflies' are selected by the Windows Live product team and are nominated for a term of one year, after which they can be renominated.[17]
Butterflies are given the benefit of new Microsoft software to test before the beta releases go public and are in direct contact with the program managers for Windows Live software.
