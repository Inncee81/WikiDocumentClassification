The ASUS Eee PC ("Eee" is pronounced as "ee" in "see", IPA: /iː/) is a subnotebook/netbook computer by ASUS and a part of ASUS Eee product family. At the time of its introduction in late 2007, it was noted for its combination of a light weight, Linux operating system, solid-state drive and relatively low cost. Newer models have added the option of Windows XP operating system and traditional hard disk drives. Newer models have also increased in price, though they remain relatively inexpensive as laptops, and notably inexpensive for ultra-small laptops.
According to ASUS, the name Eee derives from "the three Es," an abbreviation of its advertising slogan for the device: "Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play".[1]

[edit] Eee 700 series

Asus announced two Eee PC models at COMPUTEX Taipei 2007; the Eee PC 701 and the Eee PC 1001.[2] The 701 base model Eee PC 4G was released on October 16, 2007 in Taiwan. Three additional models followed. The originally-announced second model (1001) was also expected, but later ASUS renounced any plans to release it to the market. ASUS sold over 300,000 units in 2007,[3] and planned to sell several million in 2008. Intel has described the Eee PC as in line with its “World Ahead” marketing drive—which aims to provide anyone around the world a chance to own a PC.[4]
Both the price and the size of the device are small in comparison with similar Ultra-Mobile PCs. The Eee series is one response to the XO-1 notebook from the One Laptop per Child initiative. At the Intel Developer Forum 2007, Asus demonstrated the Classmate PC and the Eee PC, and listed specifications for four models of the Eee PC. ASUS at the time claimed that models may start at US$199, and range up in price and features to US$399.[5]
The final price and specifications for the Eee PC, officially announced in September 2007, differed from ASUS’s initial plans. The price rose to US$245, from US$199, while the size of the included solid-state drive was reduced from 4 GB to 2 GB, the VGA camera was dropped, and the included RAM was halved to 256 MB. As of October 25, 2007, the price range was expected to be US$50–100.[6] The 2G Surf has since gone on sale with 64 MB of RAM included.[7]
Since October 13, 2007 the ASUS website shows revised specifications. In some countries, the products have the marketing names EeePC 8G, 4G, 4G Surf, and 2G Surf, though in other countries the machines are still designated by the model numbers 700 and 701.[8] The 4G Surf uses socketed RAM but some revisions do not have a door to access the slot.[9]
ASUS announced a desktop version of the Eee PC, without an integrated display, to be released in 2008.[10] ASUS announced that a version of the Eee PC with Microsoft Windows XP pre-installed would be released by the end of the year 2007. It was, however, not released until January 2008. In Japan the version is known as the 4G-X.[11]
On January 29, 2008, it was announced that 4G Eee PC would become available in India.[12] It was released on February 2, 2008 in the city of Mumbai and is being shipped with the customized Xandros OS and not the Windows XP Starter Edition.[13] From April 5, 2008[14] ASUS plans to sell two versions of the ASUS Eee PC with Windows XP. One of them will come with 8 GB solid state and a 4 GB SDHC card. The second version will be sold without the SDHC card. The Windows XP and Linux Xandros versions of the Eee PC will sell for the same price. The Windows version is planned to include Microsoft Works 9.0; the Linux version comes with OpenOffice.[15]

[edit] Eee 900 Series




White 900 series


The Eee 900 Series was officially launched in Hong Kong on April 16, 2008[16] and in the UK on May 1, 2008 for £329 (approximately €410, USD 650 including VAT). The system was launched in the US on May 12, 2008.[17][18] The Eee 900 series with WindowsXP-OS was scheduled for launch in Germany and Austria on June 26, 2008. The Eee 900 series dimensions are a little larger than the 70x models–measuring 225 × 165 × 35 mm (WxDxH) (8.8" × 6.5" × 1.4") and weighing around 1 kg (2.2 lb).[19] The machine has a multi-touch trackpad that allow two-finger scrolling and zooming via a "pinch" gesture[20] and is available in Linux (in some markets) and/or Windows XP (in some markets) configurations.
The Linux version is called the EeePC 900 and comes with a 16 GB SSD. Some of these Eees also have a 4 GB SSD installed similarly to that in the 701 for a total storage space of 20 GB.[21] Those that do not are referred to as the Asus EEE 900 16G. The Windows XP version is called the EeePC 900 Win and also comes in two versions: one with a total storage of 12 GB (one 4 GB SSD and one 8 GB SSD) and one with 16 GB (on a single SSD). The Linux 20G version is sold for the same price as the Windows 12G version. In the case for the 16G EEEs, the Windows version costs more than the Linux version.
In some areas the 16G versions appear to be the only available Asus EEE 900 models, for example in Norway (price guide at hardware.no and price guide at kelkoo.no).
The Windows version comes with Microsoft Works and Windows Live Suite preinstalled. It also includes StarSuite 8. The machines are otherwise identical to each other with 1 GB of RAM, an 8.9-inch (226 mm) 1024×600 LCD and a 1.3 megapixel webcam. This model has the same Celeron CPU as the Eee PC 700, running at its full 900 MHz clock speed (rather than the 630 MHz speed seen in the Eee PC 700).[22]

[edit] Other Eee 90x models
On June 3, 2008 Asus unveiled the Eee 901 at COMPUTEX Taipei, the 901 was a revision of the 900 series with a similar chassis. The 901 features an Intel Atom Diamondville CPU clocked at 1.6GHz, an "expanded" battery (listed as 6-cell), and "Super Hybrid Engine" software for power management which will provide a battery life of 4.2 to 7.8 hours. Bluetooth and 802.11n Wi-Fi are also included. The 901 uses the Intel 945GSE chipset.[23], meeting the suggested requirements for Windows Vista Aero. The Eee PC 901 costs TWD 16,988 (approximately USD 559). The 901 is otherwise similar to the 900, shipping in Linux or Windows XP configurations which have different sizes of SSD storage.[24][25] Informal reports state that the machine in future will feature an "enhanced case" and additional installed software, and that in the future a version with WiMAX will be available. Reports also indicate that the launch of the Eee 901 will also be accompanied by a price drop for the 700 series and Eee 900.[26] It was also discovered that the Eee 901 has capacity for a "3GCard" upgrade which may hint at a version of the 901 being released with inbuilt mobile connectivity.[27]
The Eee PC 904HD [28] is one of the first Eee PC models which features an HDD (80GB) instead of an SSD. This model will feature an Intel Celeron M running at 900 MHz and gets its power from a 6-cell battery. Like other Eee PC 90x models this Eee PC also features 802.11 b/g WLAN and a 1.3M pixel webcam. Windows XP comes pre-installed.[29]
The Eee PC 900A features almost the same specs as the Eee PC 901 (except the primary SSD, Bluetooth, 1.3M pixel webcam and the 6-cell battery, that has been replaced by a 4-cell battery) but in a case nearly the same as used at the Eee PC 900 model.
A store specific model has appeared in Target department stores and is identified only as an Asus 8.9" Eee 4 GB PC (and as Eee PC 900 on the packaging) and is listed as using a "Intel Mobile Processor". This version contains only the 4 GB SDD on a ssd card on the expansion slot not on the motherboard, 512MB RAM and no camera. This model is available in stores with Linux or with Windows XP. This unit has the 4-cell battery, no webcam and no bluetooth. This may be the 900A, but is not identified as such on the packaging.

[edit] Battery controversy
There has been some controversy regarding the battery supplied with the EeePC 900. Versions pre-released to many non UK journalists and reviewers were equipped with a 5800 mAh battery, but the first retail versions in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and Singapore were shipped with a smaller, 4400 mAh (76% of that capacity) battery, which commentators note has led to a great variation in the machine's battery life in reviews,[30] in some cases as much as 90 minutes.[31] As a result of the objections to this, Asus provided a free battery replacement program in Hong Kong[32] and Singapore,[33] and ran a paid-for battery exchange program in the UK.[34] The UK battery exchange program ran from June 23, 2008 until July 31, 2008.[35]
Asus has stated that the smaller battery is the standard battery for the Eee 900 in Europe, and a longer warranty is provided in exchange,[36] Commentators have noted that the US version launched with the 5800 mAh battery, and a warranty of equal length.[37] Asus have revised their original statement, indicating that the smaller battery is "[p]resently the standard battery supplied in the UK" and "the default standard battery pack for ASUS Eee PC 900 worldwide", however ASUS will (from June 10, 2008) be providing a battery exchange to all UK Eee PC 900 customers for £10, and are offering a firmware update internationally which extends battery life by 30 minutes ("BIOS 0601: Updated all battery discharge tables to extend battery life").[38]
In Australia and Italy, the situation was reversed: journalists[39] and reviewers received EeePC 900 systems fitted with the 4400 mAh battery but the retail models are equipped with the 5800 mAh battery (in Italy at least at the beginning of sales).
Customers of Media Markt in Italy received the Eee at the beginning (May/June) with a 5800 mAh battery and later (June/July) with a 4400 mAh battery.
Best Buy's custom variants of the 1000HD and 900A also both include a 4400 mAh battery.

[edit] Battery Drain
In addition to the above confusion over battery capacity, users of the EeePC 900 (and 701 [40]) have noticed [41] that the battery is drained at a rate of about 10% per day even when the unit is completely powered off. This situation causes the EeePC 900 to drain completely from a full charge within 9 days even if unused. The only workaround so far is to physically remove the battery when it's not in use. Even in suspend to RAM sleep, a Celeron Eee (700, 900) can drain up to 5% an hour, making even intermittent usage last under a day. The Atom (Eee 901, 1000) models are reported to take negligible power in suspend, in addition to having better efficiency while running.[citation needed]

[edit] Eee 1000 Series




Black 1000 Series


The 1000 series launched at COMPUTEX Taipei on June 3, 2008.[42] It features a new 10 inch (254 mm) screen and a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom CPU, although built in power management software can increase the speed to 1.7 GHz. The 1000 model ships with Linux, 8 GB SSD and a 32GB SSD (total: 40GB); the 1000H model ships with Windows XP Home or Linux and an 80 or 160 GB SATA HD. Both the 1000 and the 1000H support up to 2 GB of DDR2 RAM. The 1000 has a rated battery life of 4.2-7.5 hours, while the 1000H is rated for 3.2–7 hours. It also offers a keyboard that is 92% the size of generic notebooks, aiming to make it more comfortable to type. Like the Eee PC 901, the new machines feature 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. WiMAX is not currently supported.[24][25][43]
The 1000HD released in September 2008 is a slightly cheaper version of the 1000 series. It features the same specifications as the 1000H except it uses a 900Mhz Celeron CPU chip.
The 1000HA released in October 2008 also costs less than the 1000H but has the same Intel Atom 1.6Ghz CPU, 160GB HDD, and 1 GB of RAM. It does not however have Bluetooth or wireless N. The 1000XPH has the same Intel Atom 1.6Ghz CPU, only 80GB HDD, and 1 GB of RAM. 10/100 LAN, 802.11 b/g Wireless LAN, Integrated Webcamera but no Bluetooth.
In February 2009, Asus unveiled the 1000HE, using the new Intel Atom 280 processor with a 10" LED-lit screen, 6-cell battery, 160GB HDD, Bluetooth, 802.11n wireless networking, and a revised keyboard. Asus also claims the battery will last for 9 hours.[44][45]
At CeBIT 2009, Asus unveiled the 10-inch EEE 1008HA, introducing the new design concept "Seashell".[46]

[edit] Future models
Microsoft is reportedly in talks with Asus regarding a version of Windows 7 optimized for platforms such as the Eee.[47] Future models will ship with WiMax in the later part of the year.[48]
Asus announced on September 25, 2008, that they will be including built in 3.75G HSUPA on the 901 starting in October, 2008. They will be including 3.75G in the higher models such as the 1000 series after this time.[49]
At CES 2009 Asus presented the T91 and the T101H models which will feature a multitouch trackpad and a convertible touchscreen. The T91 also features GPS and TV tuner. The models are said to be available within the first quarter of 2009.[50]

[edit] Technical overview




Asus Eee PC 700 (black model), compared with tissues and Kensington lock


The Eee PC is notable for its relatively small display, solid-state permanent storage and Linux-based operating system.
The Eee PC hardware is assembled by Pegatron Technology.[51]

[edit] Processor
The earliest Eee PC models used a 900 MHz Intel Celeron M processor underclocked to 630 MHz. Later models shipped with this processor at normal speed. Newer models use a 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor. The Atom is a simple, scalar, in-order execution microprocessor that is significantly slower per-clock than the Celeron M due to its microarchitecture. Still, 1.6 GHz Atom-equipped Eee PCs tend to perform similarly to their Celeron-equipped counterparts, due to the higher clock speeds and Hyperthreading.
Budget models, and versions of current models, also feature Celeron processors. For instance:

1000HD (distinct from 1000, 1000H and 1000HA)
904HD


[edit] Display
The Eee PC 700 has a 800×480 pixels 7 inch (178 mm) display, measured diagonally.[52] The screen does not cover the entire space within the lid; instead it is flanked on the sides by stereo speakers and, above, by the (optional) camera in the trim at the top. The Eee PC 900 and 901 come with a 1024x600 pixels 8.9-inch (226 mm) display, almost filling the lid, and became available in early 2008.[53]
With both models, external display is supported through a standard VGA connector. Maximum resolution and display configuration (mirroring, extended desktop) are dependent upon the operating system and display settings.
The Eee PC 1000 comes with a 10 inch (254 mm) or 10.2 inch (259 mm) display; the Asus site for this product does not state the number of pixels.

[edit] Keyboard
The 700 and 900 series are equipped with similar keyboards, 83% size of a generic one. The 1000 series, as it fits in a spacier case, offers an almost full-sized (92%) keyboard.

[edit] Storage




Removable 8 GB SSD in Eee PC


The early model Eee PCs use a solid-state drive for storage (instead of a hard drive), which consumes less power when in use, allows the device to boot faster, generates no noise, and is less susceptible to mechanical shock damage than hard drives. A down side of SSD storage (flash memory) is that an individual sector can only be written about 100,000 times[citation needed]. This problem can be partially mitigated by intelligent wear leveling, resulting in a MTBF comparable to conventional platter-based hard drives.
In the 2 GB and 4 GB models of the 700 series of the Eee PC, the SSD is permanently soldered to the board, to reduce manufacturing costs[citation needed]. In the 8 GB model, the SSD is a card connected via the internal PCI Express Mini Card connector, leaving the original SSD area on the motherboard empty.[54]
The Eee PC 900 comes with a removable 8 or 16 GB PCI Express Mini SSD module, with or without four additional 1 GB memory chips soldered on the main board. The size of the SSD is dependent upon which OS is shipped, with one XP version coming with the 8 GB and all remaining ones (XP or Linux) coming with 16 GB.
The Eee PC 1000 uses an 8 GB internal SSD, with a 32 GB PCI Express Mini SSD module for a total of 40 GB. The 1000H does not have a SSD, and instead uses an internal hard drive of either 80 or 160 GB. [55]
All Eee PC models also include a memory card reader, supporting SD, SDHC and MMC cards for additional storage while the Eee pc S101 also has support for Memorystick and MS-PRO.
[56]
Eee PC 1004DN is the first model with a Super-Multi optical disc drive (ODD) that reads and writes data to DVD or Compact Disc[57]

[edit] RAM
The 4 GB SSD and 8 GB SSD Eee PC models use 533/667 MHz DDR2 RAM via a standard SO-DIMM module, which can be swapped out.
There is a big difference between the white and the black models of ASUS EEEPC 4G Surf. The black model EEEPC 4G SURF (4GS-PK008) has a removable panel on its underside that allows you to easily change the RAM. The white model EEEPC 4G SURF (4GS-W010) lacks this access panel, meaning you will have to disassemble the netbook to upgrade it.[58] Newer white models now have the access panel.
The hardware supports up to 4 GB (2 GB for the 1000 series, and some of the 900 series),[citation needed] but the preinstalled Xandros kernel of the 700 series only supports up to 1 GB.

[edit] Cooling
In an EE380 talk[59] (video archive), an ASUS engineer mentioned that the Eee PC does not use a conventional heat sink to absorb the heat generated by the processor, but instead uses the keyboard shielding to spread the heat. The Eee PC has a fan, and some vents to also cool off the system (as it does heat up a little).

[edit] Software




OpenOffice.org Writer running on the Eee PC


The base Linux system boots in 20–22 seconds,[60] substantially faster than the boot time for an installation of Windows XP on the same hardware[61] On top of this, the Eee PC runs a custom tab-based interface and uses IceWM as the default window manager.
The Linux system comes with forty bundled software applications including OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Skype[62], Tux Paint and other educational entertainment software, e-mail and Internet radio applications, and look-up tools for Google Docs and Wikipedia.[63]
The operating system drivers for the ACPI and Wireless devices supplied with the pre-installed Xandros operating system are versions of software licensed under the GNU General Public License. The company released the source code as a ZIP file along with the product; however, it has been reported that a small percentage of the source may be missing, and some device driver software appears obfuscated.[64] In the absence of necessary source code, other Linux kernel versions and distributions on the device are less easy to use with some of the hardware. ASUS has requested people help by identifying specific source code which is still missing[65] and has since released the source code for the ACPI module.[66] They have also released the patched Linux kernel sources and their Busybox sources.[67]
The Synaptic Package Manager and apt-get can be used to install additional software through the repositories.
The new standard operating systems for the Eee PC are now either Windows XP or Linux Xandros. The consumer can choose between either and the two operating systems have different specifications on each Eee PC.

[edit] Forks and other distributions
Current Asus Linux development policy generates forks of code as they change. This means that their changes do not go directly into upstream versions and remain available only through Asus source code releases. If one wants to change to another distribution or update the software, it is necessary to determine what has been changed (using, for example, the diff utility) and port into a newer version or other distribution.
For example, the EEE PC 900 model has a sound card that required some modifications to the Linux kernel driver in order to work. Asus' modifications were against version 2.6.21.4 from June 2007. At current version 2.6.26 as of July 2008, such modifications were not yet merged to the official Linux kernel. Thus other distributions will not have such modifications and will not work properly on EEE PC 900 devices (specifically, the microphone won't work). Latest ALSA drivers 1.0.17 (as of July 2008) incorporated the changes necessary to work with EEE PC 900.

[edit] Compatible operating systems
As the Eee PC uses a standard x86 processor, most PC operating systems can be installed with little effort. However, full hardware support varies, especially for the latest models. The following operating systems are known to work:

GNU/Linux: Xandros, Ubuntu,[68][69], Eeebuntu,[70] Easy Peasy,[71] Fedora,[72] openSUSE,[73] Debian,[74] Mandriva Linux,[75] Arch Linux,[76] Puppeee,[77] Puppy,[78] Backtrack[79], Google's Android [80], Gentoo Linux[81], CrunchBang,[82]

Expansion: two PCI Express Mini Card connectors: one occupied by the wireless network card; another empty, accessible on some models from opening on back of unit, which supports only Asus-approved SSD expansion units. The second PCIE connection is unavailable on many current-generation EeePCs and some older models.[111]





1 In the UK the Eee is also promoted as the RM Asus Minibook,[112] which is targeted at students; however, the unit itself is no different.
2701 4G (non-Surf) late releases have Windows XP pre-installed without Microsoft Works and Windows Live Suite, excluding the disc, or either Xandros OS pre-installed.[citation needed]

Asus Source:[113]

[edit] Configurations




The 700 series units are shipped in 3 colors besides black and white.


Naming of the 700 series of models of the device appears to relate to the size of installed SSD, camera, and battery size.[114] The Eee PC Surf models include the 4400 mAh battery pack and no webcam, while the non-Surf models have the 5200 mAh battery pack and a webcam installed. The model numbers (700, 701) may still be the same as has been seen on pre-production samples. ASUS may offer upgrades for the SSD storage via the empty Mini PCIe slot, which has been shown to be labeled FLASH_CON in take apart photos of the 4G.[111] When a Mini PCIe card is inserted into the spare empty slot, the internal SSD gets disabled, making the device unable to boot from the original SSD.[115] There are also signal lines for a USB port on the Mini PCIe pins which have been used to connect various USB devices internally. Some 701 models with serial numbers starting at 7B do not have a second mini PCIe slot soldered onto the motherboard, though the circuit traces and solder pads remain.[116]
The final Eee PC 700 series specifications and pricing differ substantially from Asus' original announcement. A 2 GB SSD model was in the initial announcement for USD 199,[4] although many news stories carried the information incorrectly much later and indicated that a 4 GB model would be offered at USD 199. It was reported that the price of the low-end model rose from USD 199 to USD 245 (reportedly at least partly due to rise in prices of 7 inch (178 mm) LCD displays[117]), while the solid-state drive went from 4 GB to 2 GB, and the VGA camera was dropped when ASUS published the Eee PC models with the Surf/non-Surf model names.
A controversy over a "warranty void if removed" sticker on the RAM access cover panel has prompted ASUS to release a statement clarifying the matter, stating that "merely breaking or removing this kind of seal will not void the ASUS Limited Warranty" (emphasis is original). Since then, ASUS has offered to replace the labels with ones specifying merely that ASUS will not be held "responsible for the damage caused by improper hardware change." Furthermore, ASUS altered their Limited Warranty to "eliminate any provision stating that the ASUS Limited Warranty will be voided simply because the product is serviced by a non-ASUS-approved service facility, or if non-ASUS-approved components or software are installed or used."[118]




EeePC in its case.


In the 70x series, the pre-installed Xandros operating system has a Linux kernel with a kernel option set limiting the detected RAM size to a maximum of 1 GB, even if a larger RAM module is installed. The actual capacity is shown in full in the BIOS setup and under other OSes.[119] However it is possible to recompile the kernel with support for more RAM. The 900 and later laptops had the kernel pre-configured to support up to 4 GB of memory address space.

[edit] Educational use
On November 8, 2007, Fresno Unified School District, in Fresno, California announced a digital portfolio and laptop pilot program, in which sixteen schools will use the mini-laptops in the classroom at a ratio of one laptop for every two students. Eventually the district expects that all 78,000 students will create and manage their own web-based portfolios from kindergarten through 12th grade.[120]
In the UK, RM Education, a large supplier to the educational field, contracted as a distributor of the Eee PC and distributed their re-branded versions - renamed RM Asus miniBook - to schools and colleges.[121]

[edit] Popularity

[edit] Sales
Asus shipped 700,000 Eee PCs in September 2008 and total shipments reached 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2008 (behind the 2.15 million shipment of Aspire One), [122] making Asus the world's fifth largest portable computer manufacturer. [123]

[edit] Books about the Asus Eee
Three books were published about the Asus Eee in 2008: ASUS Eee PC For Dummies by Joel McNamara (a For Dummies book)[124], Using the Asus Eee PC by Bill Lawrence[125], and Asus Eee PC by Christian Immler[126].
