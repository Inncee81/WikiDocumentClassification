"Auld Lang Syne" is a Scottish poem written by Robert Burns in 1788 and set to the tune of a traditional folk song (Roud # 6294). It is well known in many English-speaking countries and is often sung to celebrate the start of the new year at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day.
The song's Scots title may be translated into English literally as "old long since", or more idiomatically, "long long ago"[1] or "days gone by". The phrase "Auld Lang Syne" is also used in similar poems by Robert Ayton (1570–1638), Allan Ramsay (1686–1757), and James Watson (1711) as well as older folk songs predating Burns.[2] In his retelling of fairy tales in the Scots language, Matthew Fitt uses the phrase "In the days of auld lang syne" as the equivalent of "Once upon a time." In Scots syne is pronounced like the English word sign and the trigonometric sine function.

[edit] History
Robert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the Scots Musical Museum with the remark, “The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man".[3] Some of the lyrics were indeed "collected" rather than composed by the poet; the ballad "Old Long Syne" printed in 1711 by James Watson shows considerable similarity in the first verse and the chorus to Burns' later poem.[2] It is a fair supposition to attribute the rest of the poem to Burns himself.[3]
There is some doubt as to whether the melody used today is the same one Burns originally intended, but it is widely used both in Scotland and in the rest of the world. [4]
Singing the song on Hogmanay or New Year's Eve very quickly became a Scots custom that soon spread to other parts of the British Isles. As Scots (and other Britons) emigrated around the world, they took the song with them.
Canadian band leader Guy Lombardo is often credited with popularising the use of the song at New Year’s celebrations in America, through his annual broadcasts on radio and television, beginning in 1929. The song became his trademark. In addition to his live broadcasts, Lombardo recorded the song more than once. His first recording was in 1939. A later recording on September 29, 1947 was record issued as a single by Decca Records as catalog #24260.[5]
However, earlier newspaper articles describe revellers on both sides of the Atlantic singing the song to usher in the New Year:

"Holiday Parties at Lenox" (Massachusetts, USA) (1896) – The company joined hands in the great music room at midnight and sang “Auld Lang Syne” as the last stroke of 12 sounded and the new year came in.[6]


"New Year's Eve in London" (London, England) (1910) – Usual Customs Observed by People of All Classes… The passing of the old year was celebrated in London much as usual. The Scottish residents gathered outside of St. Paul's Church and sang “Auld Lang Syne” as the last stroke of 12 sounded from the great bell.[7]

A manuscript of "Auld Lang Syne" is held in the permanent collection of The Lilly Library at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.[8]

[edit] Lyrics
As detailed above, auld lang syne literally means "old long since", but a more idiomatic English translation would be something like "long long ago",[1] "days of long ago", or "olden days". "For old times' sake" or "to the (good) old days" may be modern-day expressions, in common use as toasts, that capture the spirit of "for auld lang syne". Although the song begins with a question whether old times should be forgotten, the song is generally interpreted as a call to remember long standing friendships.[9] Thomson’s Select Songs of Scotland was published in 1799 in which the second verse about greeting and toasting was moved to its present position at the end.[9]
Most common use of the song involves only the first verse and the chorus. Confusion about the exact meaning of the words has led to a common use of "For the sake of" or "For the days of" in the last line, despite this not being part of the traditional lyric.

[edit] Melody
The tune to which "Auld Lang Syne" is now universally sung is a pentatonic Scots folk melody, probably originally a sprightly dance in a much quicker tempo.[9]
English composer William Shield seems to quote the "Auld Lang Syne" melody briefly at the end of the overture to his opera Rosina, which may be its first recorded use. The contention that Burns borrowed the melody from Shield is for various reasons highly unlikely, although they may very well both have taken it from a common source, possibly a strathspey called The Miller's Wedding or The Miller's Daughter. The problem is that tunes based on the same set of dance steps necessarily have a similar rhythm, and even a superficial resemblance in melodic shape may cause a very strong apparent similarity in the tune as a whole. For instance, Burns' poem "Coming Through the Rye" is sung to a tune that might also be based on the Miller's Wedding. The origin of the tune of God Save the Queen (q.v.) presents a very similar problem, and for just the same reason, as it is also based on a dance measure. (See the note in the William Shield article on this subject.)
Songwriter George M. Cohan quotes "Auld Lang Syne" in the second to last line of the chorus of "You're a Grand Old Flag".

[edit] Use

[edit] At New Year
"Auld Lang Syne" is usually sung each year at midnight on Hogmanay (New Year's Eve) in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Malta, South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Zimbabwe, and English-speaking areas of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and signifies the start of a new year.
In Scotland, it is often sung at the end of a céilidh or a dance. It is common practice that everyone joins hands with the person next to them to form a great circle around the dance floor. At the beginning of the last verse, everyone crosses their arms across their breast, so that the right hand reaches out to the neighbour on the left and vice versa. When the tune ends, everyone rushes to the middle, while still holding hands. When the circle is re-established, everyone turns under the arms to end up facing outwards with hands still joined. Outside of Scotland the hands are often crossed from the beginning of the song at variance with Scottish custom.
The Scottish practice was demonstrated by the Queen at the Millennium Dome celebrations for the year 2000. The English press incorrectly berated her for not "properly" crossing her arms, unaware that she was correct.[10][11]

[edit] Other than New Year

In the United Kingdom, it is played at the close of the annual Congress (conference) of the Trades Union Congress.


In many Burns Clubs, it is sung at end the Burns supper.


The song is sung at the end of the Last Night of the Proms by the audience (rather than the performers) and so it is not often listed on the official programme.


The song is played at the Passing Out Parade of Young Officers in the Royal Navy as the march up the steps of the Britannia Royal Naval College. The song is played at the beat of slow march after the tune "Will ye no come back?". The song is also played at the Graduation Parade of the Royal Military College of Canada.


In the United States, the song is used as a song of remembrance at memorial events. The University of Virginia's alma mater ("The Good Old Song"), the anthem of Alpha Kappa Psi, Beta Theta Pi's "Parting Song" and Phi Sigma Kappa's "Initiation Hymn" are all sung to the tune of "Auld Lang Syne".


Since 2007, the melody has been used as an introduction to the mass chorus of America the Beautiful that is played by the twelve finalist corps at the Finals Retreat at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Coincidentally, "Auld Lang Syne" and "America the Beautiful" have the same metre, and the lyrics can be sung interchangeably.


The song is the official corps song for the Kilties drum and bugle corps.


[edit] In non-English speaking countries

In Thailand, it is used for Samakkkhi Chumnum (Together in unity), sung after sports. At New Year the melody is used with words with a similar meaning to the Scots. There, it is commonly believed to be a Thai traditional song.


In Pakistani Military, the band plays this song during the graduating parade of the recruits, and in Pakistan generally it is sung (or the melody played) at farewell events.


In Bangladesh and Bengali parts of India, the melody was the direct inspiration for the popular Bengali song "Purano shei diner kotha" (About the old days) composed by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, and forms one of the more recognizable tunes in Rabindra Sangeet (Rabindra's Songs), a body of work of 2,230 songs and lyrical poems that form the backbone of Bengali music.











Japanese version of Auld Lang Syne. This song is called 蛍の光 in Japan(read as "Hotaru no Hikari" means "lights of fireflies"). 1m00s


In Japan, the Japanese students' song Hotaru no hikari ("Glow of a Firefly") uses the "Auld Lang Syne" tune. The words are a series of images of hardships that the industrious student endures in his relentless quest for knowledge, starting with the firefly’s light, which the student uses to keep studying when he has no other light sources. It is used as a graduation song and a funeral song in Taiwan and Hong Kong, symbolising an end or a goodbye. In Japan it is used in graduation ceremonies, and many stores and restaurants play it to usher customers out at the end of a business day.


Before the composition of Aegukga, the lyrics of Korea’s national anthem were sung to the tune of this song until composer Ahn Eak-tai composed a new melody to the existing lyrics. Like Japan and Taiwan, it is now used in South Korea as a graduation song and a farewell song to friends or at funerals.


In Indonesia, the melody is used as a farewell song that is commonly sung during graduation or farewell parties.


In Malaysia, the melody is sung in English and Malay language as a farewell song for various occasions.


In the Philippines, it is sung at celebrations such as graduations, New Year and Christmas Day.


Before 1972, it was the tune for the Gaumii salaam anthem of The Maldives (with the current words).


In Denmark, the song was translated in 1927 by the famous Danish poet Jeppe Aakjær. Much like Robert Burns' use of dialect, Aakjær translated the song into the Danish dialect sallingbomål, a dialect from the northern part of western Jutland, south of the Limfjord, often hard for other Danes to understand. The song Skuld gammel venskab rejn forgo ("Should auld acquantaince be forgot" — Scots / "Should old acquaintance be forgotten" — English), is an integral part of the Danish Højskole tradition, and often associated with more rural areas and old traditions. Also, the former Danish rock group Gasolin modernised the melody in 1974 with their pop ballad Stakkels Jim ("Poor Jim").


In France, Brazil, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Poland, and Germany this song is used to mark a farewell. In France, the melody is used with French words and the parting song is entitled Ce n’est qu’un au revoir ("This is only a goodbye", i.e., a temporary parting, as opposed to a definitive "Farewell"). In Portugal, Spain, Poland, Germany and Russia, the tune is used by the Scouts movement for their farewell song at the end of summer camps or just to say goodbye after events. The Polish song with other lyrics is titled Ogniska już dogasa blask, the Russian one Собралися мы здесь, друзья. The German version is titled Nehmt Abschied Brüder and the Portuguese one Canção do Adeus. The Spanish song is titled Adiós Scout.


In Italy, this melody is very well known by Italian football supporters since the 1970s. It is often sung in stadiums during the matches, especially after the kick-off. Many Italian supporters of different regions and cities adopted this tune and arranged its lyrics according to their teams. These are the lyrics sung by A.S. Roma supporters: La nostra fede mai morrà/canteremo noì ultrà/e insieme a te saremo allor/forza Roma vinci ancor ("Our faith will never die/we, the ultrà, will sing/then we'll be with you/come on Roma, win again"). The tune is used for the Dutch football song, Wij houden van Oranje ("We love Orange").


In Zimbabwe, the melody is sung in Shona as a funeral farewell song, "Famba zvinyoronyoro, tichasanganiswa muroa ra Jesu", literally, go well, we will be united in the blood of Christ.


In India the song is played by the Naval Band for the passing out of Officers and also during farewell of senior officers during the "Pulling out" .


[edit] Use in films

It has been used in a number of films, with its first use in the 1942 re-release of the Charlie Chaplin film The Gold Rush with added sound, the song is sung at a New Year's Eve party. It is not certain if the same song was sung when the original silent film was released in 1925.


The song has been used in the film Waterloo Bridge - under the name of The Farewell Waltz - (1940), starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor. It is arguably one of the most memorable and best-loved sequences of the film.


It was also used in the Triad Trilogy Infernal Affairs uses the tune in the second film when a triad has finished killing a gang boss.


The song is sung in many of the films produced by Frank Capra, including It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.


The W.S. Van Dyke film, I Take This Woman (1940), starring Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr uses the song at the film's finale, with the patients and staff of a clinic singing it a cappella; the finale of It's a Wonderful Life is a direct echo of this presentation.


In the Samuel Fuller film The Steel Helmet, the film's main character, Sgt. Zack, requests that the song be played by "Fat Paul" on a portable organ. The group of American soldiers is shocked to find out, after a South Korean boy who has accompanied them recognizes and sings Korean lyrics to the tune, that the melody also serves as the South Korean national anthem.


In The Quiet Earth Zac and Joanne sing it the during an evening celebration after meeting Api, the third person left on Earth.


More recently, towards the end of Ghostbusters II, the people of New York City sing "Auld Lang Syne", which weakens the evil Viggo the Carpathian's power enough to be defeated.


The song was played in When Harry Met Sally, the New Year's party in which Harry states he never fully understood what the song meant and says "I mean, 'Should old acquaintance be forgot'? Does that mean that we should forget old acquaintances, or does it mean if we happened to forget them, we should remember them, which is not possible because we already forgot?".


Sofie Fatale's cell phone ringtone is Auld Lang Syne in the film Kill Bill Volume 1.


In the 2008 film Sex and the City, a recording by Scottish singer Mairi Campbell is used during a montage depicting the characters' actions at New Years. The recording is notable for its use of the original melody as opposed to the commonly performed melody sung today. It is also in contrast to the joyous and jubilant arrangements commonly heard on celebratory occasions, as it consists merely of an acoustic guitar and strings accompanying Campbell's vocals.


The American PBS television series Great Performances 2006/7 program titled "Garrison Keillor’s New Year’s Eve Special" had the audience sing an adaptation of the lyrics with a humorous last verse: "I think of all the great, high hearts I had when I was young / And now who are these sad old farts I find myself among?"


[edit] Some notable performances

A somewhat different use of the song as a farewell occurred in October 2000, when it was played as the body of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau left Parliament Hill in Ottawa for the last time, going to Montreal for the state funeral.


On the sinking of the Japanese ship Montevideo Maru in World War II, carrying 1,053 Australians (mostly POWs), the Australians in the water sang this for their trapped mates as the ship went down. Surviving Japanese crewman Yosiaki Yamaji reflected on this moment as realising what big hearts the Australian soldiers had.


According to the book "Freedom at Midnight"(1975) by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, the song was played to accompany the departure of the final British troops from India through Mumbai's "Gateway to India" in 1948, as the British flag over the Gateway was ceremonially lowered for the last time. Similarly it was used at the British hand-over of Hong Kong in 1997.


In Pakistan, the tune was played at the formal resignation of President Pervez Musharraf as the country's Chief of Army Staff.
