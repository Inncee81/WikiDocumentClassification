[edit] History
Meebo was founded in September 2005 by Sandy Jen, Seth Sternberg and Elaine Wherry, and is based in Mountain View, California.[3]
Meebo received funding from Sequoia Capital on December 15, 2005.[4] Meebo includes features such as invisible sign on (to prevent others from knowing when a user connects) and simultaneous connections to multiple IM services.[5]
On August 2, 2006, Meebo launched the "meebo me" widget, which allows users to embed a version of Meebo on their personal website. Additionally, on October 11, 2006, they announced a partnership with Amie Street to include the "meebo me" widget on each Amie Street user page.[6][7]
Meebo allows some people who are behind firewalled networks (networks that block the various instant messaging protocols but have not blocked the meebo.com domain name) to connect to instant messaging services due to the fact that the user connects to only port 443 (HTTPS) and the Meebo service itself then connects to the various instant messaging protocols.[8]
As of May 14, 2007, Meebo incorporated "Meebo Rooms". Users of Meebo can connect to chat rooms or host their own for which multiple friends can join and chat. Meebo Rooms also grants a degree of control to the user with invite and ban authority. Classic Meebo was updated to reflect the release prior to Meebo Rooms to allow users with outdated browsers to continue to use meebo.[9]
On September 10, 2007, Meebo announced support for file transfers between users.
In late 2007, Meebo was included as a web app with gOS, a Linux distribution.
In April 2008, Meebo secured $25M in venture capital funding.[10]
In December 2008, Meebo added support for two new IM networks, Myspace IM and Facebook Chat.

[edit] Achievements

In June 2006, Meebo was listed 65 of PC World’s 100 Best Products of the Year.[11]
In August 2006, Meebo was listed as one of Time's Top 50 Coolest Websites for 2006.[12][13]
