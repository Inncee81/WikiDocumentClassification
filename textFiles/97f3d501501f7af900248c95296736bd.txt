Newbery Medal





Awarded for
the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children


Presented by
Association for Library Service to Children


Country
 United States


First awarded
1922


Official website


The John Newbery Medal is a literary award given by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association (ALA). The award is given to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. The award has been given since 1922. It was the first children's literary award in the world.[1] It is named for John Newbery, an 18th century publisher of juvenile books. The Newbery Medal was designed by Rene Paul Chambellan and created by Frederic G. Melcher in 1921. It depicts on the reverse an author giving his work (a book) to male and female children to read. Worthy runners-up are conferred annually with the Newbery Honor award.
Together with the Caldecott Medal, Newbery is considered one of the two most prestigious awards for children's literature in the United States. When the winner is announced each January, bookstores sell out, libraries order copies and teachers add the book to their lesson plans.[1] Many bookstores and libraries have Newbery sections; popular television shows interview the winners; textbooks includes lists of Newbery winners, and many master's and doctoral theses are written about them.[1]
In addition to the Newbery medal the committee awards additional citations referred to as the Newbery Honor to worthy runners-up. Though the Newbery Honor was initiated in 1971, specially cited runners-up for the Newbery Medal from previous years were retroactively named Newbery Honor books.
Only five authors have won multiple Newbery Medals: E.L. Konigsburg, Joseph Krumgold, Lois Lowry, Katherine Paterson, and Elizabeth George Speare have each been awarded two Newbery Medals. The author with the most Newbery Honors but without a Newbery is Laura Ingalls Wilder; she received 5 Newbery Honors.

[edit] Criteria for award

The book must be published in English in the United States the previous year.
The author must be a citizen or resident of the United States.
The book must be considered for its theme, presentation (clarity, accuracy and organization), plot, characters, setting, and style.
The book must relate to a child audience.
The book must contribute to literature.
The book must stand alone and not as a part of a multimedia presentation.[2]


[edit] Controversy
In October 2008, Anita Silvey, a children's literary expert, published an article in the School Library Journal criticizing the committee for choosing books that are too difficult for children.[1] Lucy Calkins, the Reading and Writing Project at Columbia University's Teachers College agreed with Silvey: "I can't help but believe that thousands, even millions, more children would grow up reading if the Newbery committee aimed to spotlight books that are deep and beautiful and irresistible to kids."[1] John Beach, associate professor of literacy education at St. John's University in New York, compared the books that adults choose for children with the books that children choose for themselves and found that in the past 30 years, there is only 5 percent overlap between the Children's Choice Awards (International Reading Association) and the Notable Children's Books list (American Library Association).[1]
