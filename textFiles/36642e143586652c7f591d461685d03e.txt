Plaque commemorating the popes buried in St. Peter's


There is no official list of popes, but the Annuario Pontificio, published every year by the Vatican, contains a list that is generally considered to be the most authoritative. Its list is the one given here. The Annuario Pontificio list gives Benedict XVI as the 265th pope of Rome.
While the term Pope (Latin: papa "father'") is used in several Churches to denote their high spiritual leaders (for example Coptic Pope), this title in English usage can by itself refer to the head of the Catholic Church. The title itself has been used officially by the head of the Catholic Church since the tenure of Pope Siricius, although it has been first used by the Copts centuries earlier.
Hermannus Contractus may have been the first historian to number the popes continuously. His list ends in 1049 with Pope Leo IX as number 154. In 2001 a rigorous study was made by the Catholic church into the history of the papacy.[1] Based on that research, in 2008 there have been 265 Popes and 267 pontificates. The difference can be attributed to the fact that Benedict IX reigned three different times between 1032 and 1048.
Several changes have been made in the list during the 20th century. Antipope Christopher was considered legitimate for a long time. Pope-elect Stephen was considered legitimate under the name Stephen II until the 1961 edition and erased then. Although these changes are no longer controversial, a number of modern lists still include this "first Pope Stephen II". It is probable that this is because they are based on the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopaedia, which is in the public domain.
The Latin Episcopus Romanus translates as Bishop of Rome.

On July 16, 1054, legates sent by Pope Leo IX to the Byzantine capital excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius, who promptly reciprocated. Centuries of disputes over such matters as Primacy of the Roman Pontiff, the ecclesiastical calendar, the use of leavened or unleavened bread, and additions to the Creed (notably the filioque clause) reached their nadir on that date. Although the excommunications were originally intended to be of an individual nature, the break in communion spread to the broader church as sides were chosen; the East-West schism still exists today.

15
The last pope to be crowned with the Papal Tiara. Concluded Second Vatican Council. In 1965, the specific anathemas and excommunications resulting in the East-West schism of 1054 (see Pope Leo IX) were lifted through the "embrace of peace" and declaration of reconciliation by Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople and Pope Paul VI. In spite of the lifting of this historical obstacle, the actual break in communion between the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church still exists, However, a serious dialogue on reconciliation between the two churches has taken place over the past four decades.

19 April 2005 - present

Benedict XVI
Papa Benedictus Sextus Decimus, Episcopus Romanus
Joseph Alois Ratzinger
Marktl am Inn, Bavaria, Germany
78 / -
3
First German pope since Stephen IX in 1058. Oldest to become pope since Clement XII in 1730. When Benedict ascended to the Papacy his election was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted "his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust".



[edit] Religious Orders
30 popes have been members of religious orders. These have included:

14 Benedictines (Gregory I, Boniface IV, Adeodatus II, Leo IV, John IX, Leo VII, Stephen IX, Gregory VII, Victor III, Urban II, Gelasius II, Celestine V, Urban V, and Pius VII)
5 Dominicans (Innocent V, Benedict XI, Nicholas V, Pius V, and Benedict XIII)
3 Cistercians (Paschal II, Eugene III, and Benedict XII)
3 Franciscans (Nicholas IV, Sixtus IV, and Julius II)
2 Augustinians (Adrian IV and Eugene IV)
2 Conventual Franciscans (Sixtus V and Clement XIV)
and 1 Camaldolese (Gregory XVI)


[edit] Notes on numbering of popes
A number of anomalies in the list given above need further explanation:

Felix II (356-357), Boniface VII (974, 984-985), John XVI (997-998), Benedict X (1058-1059) and Alexander V (1409-1410) are not listed because they are considered antipopes.[2]
The numbering of popes named Felix has been amended to omit antipope Felix II. However, most lists still call the last two Felixes Felix III and Felix IV. Additionally, there was an antipope Felix V.[2]
There has never been a pope John XX as a result of confusion of the numbering system in the 11th century.[3]
Pope-elect Stephen, who died before being consecrated, has not been on the Vatican's official list of popes since 1961, but appears on lists dating from before 1960.[3] The numbering of following popes called Stephen are nowadays given as Pope Stephen II to Pope Stephen IX, rather than Stephen III to Stephen X.
When Simon de Brion became pope in 1281, he chose to be called Martin. At that time, Marinus I and Marinus II were mistakenly considered to be Martin II and Martin III respectively, and so, erroneously, Simon de Brion became Pope Martin IV.[4]
Pope Donus II, said to have reigned about 974, never existed. The belief resulted from the confusion of the title dominus (lord) with a proper name. (Pope Joan also probably never existed; however, legends about her may have originated from stories about the pornocracy.)[5]


The status of Antipope John XXIII was uncertain for hundreds of years, and was finally settled in 1958 when Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli announced his own name as John XXIII. Baldassare Cossa, who was Antipope John XXIII, served as a Cardinal of the reunited church before his death in 1419 and his remains are found in the Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence).
