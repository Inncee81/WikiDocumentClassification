From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Apple Design Awards is a special event hosted by Apple Inc. at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The event is meant to recognize the best and most innovative Macintosh software and hardware produced by independent developers, as well as the best and most creative uses of Apple's products. The ADAs, as they are commonly known, are awarded in a variety of categories which vary from year to year. The Apple Design Awards have been presented each year since 1996, though for the first two years of their existence they were known as the Human Interface Design Excellence, or HIDE, awards.
Since 2003 the physical awards were designed with an Apple logo that glows when touched. These new awards were engineered and built by Sparkfactor Design.[1][2] The early awards were dubbed the "Heidis", but this name was dropped in 1998, in favor of the simpler Apple Design Awards.
