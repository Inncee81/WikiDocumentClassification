[edit] History

[edit] Start
Internet Advertising Network was started by Kevin O'Connor and Dwight Merriman in 1995. IAN and the DoubleClick division of Poppe-Tyson (a division of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt advertising) where merged into a new corporation named DoubleClick in 1996. DoubleClick was first in the online media rep business -- that is, representing websites to sell advertising space to marketers. In 1997 it began offering the online ad serving and management technology they had developed to other publishers as the DART services. During the dot-com downturn, DoubleClick divested its media business, and today focuses on uploading ads and reporting their performance.

[edit] Early developments
In 1999, at a cost of US $1.7 billion, DoubleClick merged with the direct marketing firm Abacus Direct, which works with offline catalog companies. This raised fears that the combined company would link anonymous Web-surfing profiles with personally identifiable information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail, address, etc.) collected by Abacus. This merger made waves and was heavily criticized by privacy organizations. Controversy grew when it was discovered that sensitive financial information users entered on a popular Web site that offered financial software was inadvertently being sent to DoubleClick, which delivered the ads. Much of this controversy was generated by statements made by Jason Catlett of Junkbusters, claiming that DoubleClick was or intended to do things that it had never mentioned or included in any planned or announced service. Due to the negative press, DoubleClick dropped any integration of their services with those of Abacus, and instigated stronger privacy policies and oversight.
In April 2005, Hellman & Friedman, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, announced its intent to acquire the company and operate it as two separate divisions with two separate CEOs for TechSolutions and Data Marketing. The deal was closed in July 2005. Hellman & Friedman announced in December 2006 the sale of Abacus to Epsilon Interactive.

[edit] Acquisition by Google, Inc.
Google announced on April 14, 2007 that it had come to a definitive agreement to acquire DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in cash.[1]
US lawmakers have investigated possible privacy and antitrust implications of the proposed acquisition.[2] At hearings, representatives from Microsoft warned of a potential monopolistic effect, the irony of which was not lost on the committee chairperson.[3] On December 20, 2007, the FTC approved Google's purchase of DoubleClick from its owners Hellman & Friedman and JMI Equity, saying, "After carefully reviewing the evidence, we have concluded that Google's proposed acquisition of DoubleClick is unlikely to substantially lessen competition." [4] European Union regulators followed suit on March 11, 2008. Google completed the acquisition later that day.
On April 2, 2008, Google announced it would cut 300 jobs at DoubleClick due to organizational redundancies. Selected employees will be matched within the Google organization as per position and experience. [5]

[edit] Criticism
DoubleClick is often linked with the controversy over spyware because browser HTTP cookies are set to track users as they travel from website to website and record what commercial advertisements they view and select while browsing. [6]
DoubleClick has also been critisized for misleading users by offering an opt-out option that is insufficiently effective though is the only technique available since all information is anonymous. According to a San Francisco IT consulting group, although the opt-out option affects cookies; DoubleClick still has the ability, as does any website, to track users via IP addresses.[7] In addition, users need to opt-out every time their browser's cookie file is updated or erased.[8].

[edit] Products
DoubleClick offers technology products and services that are sold primarily to advertising agencies and media companies to allow clients to traffic, target, deliver, and report on their interactive advertising campaigns. The company's main product line is known as DART, which is designed for advertisers and publishers.
DART automates the administration effort in the ad buying cycle for advertisers (DART for Advertisers, or DFA) and the management of ad inventory for publishers (DART for Publishers, or DFP). It is intended to increase the purchasing efficiency of advertisers and to minimize unsold inventory for publishers.
DART Enterprise is the rebranded version of NetGravity AdServer, which DoubleClick acquired with its purchase of NetGravity in 1999.
In 2004 DoubleClick acquired Performics[9]. Performics offers affiliate marketing, search engine optimization, and search engine marketing solutions. The markering solutions were integrated into the core DART system and rebranded DART search.
DoubleClick Advertising Exchange (released Q2 2007) attempts to go even further by connecting both media buyers and sellers on an exchange much like a traditional stock exchange (NYSE, LSE or NASDAQ)

[edit] Data collection
DoubleClick targets along various criteria. Targeting can be accomplished using IP addresses, business rules set by the client or by reference to information about users stored within cookies on their machines. Some of the types of information collected are:

Browser
Operating System
ISP
Bandwidth
Time of day

In addition, the cookie information may be used to target ads based on the number of times the user has been exposed to any given message. This is known as "frequency capping".
