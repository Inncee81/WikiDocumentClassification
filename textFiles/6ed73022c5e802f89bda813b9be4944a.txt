Roy Thomas Fielding (born 1965) is an American computer scientist. He is one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification (RFC 2616), and a frequently-cited authority on computer network architecture.
Fielding was born in Laguna Beach, California, and received a doctorate from the University of California, Irvine in 2000.
Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, Fielding's doctoral dissertation, describes Representational State Transfer (REST) as a key architectural principle of the world wide web, and received a large amount of attention. People now frequently hold up REST as an approach to developing web services, as an alternative to other distributed-computing specifications such as CORBA. Fielding has also been heavily involved in the development of HTML and Uniform Resource Identifiers, was a co-founder of the Apache HTTP Server project and was a member of the interim OpenSolaris Boards. He currently works as chief scientist at Day Software in Newport Beach, California.
