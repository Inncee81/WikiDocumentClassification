From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

ID-Ten-T Error (also seen as ID10T and ID107) is a term often used by tech support operators and computer experts to describe a problem that is due to the user's ignorance instead of a software or hardware malfunction. It is a masked jab at the user: when ID-Ten-T is spelled out it becomes ID10T, l33tspeak for "idiot". (Though the usage actually predates 1337 as a part of geek culture.) It is also known as a "Ten-T error" or "ID:10T error".
Historical use (circa 1995) includes phone tech support personnel instructing the user/customer to place the line "id=10t" in their config.sys file.
A highly popularized example of this is a user mistaking their CD-ROM tray for a cupholder, or a user looking for the "any key". However, any variety of stupidity or ignorance induced problems can be described as ID10T errors.
ID10T is also a term used in Naval parlance[citation needed], although pronounced 'Eye-Dee-Ten-Tango'. Its usage is similar to that described above.
1D10T is also a term used in Army slang (pronounced "one dee ten tee" ) usually in reference to the massive amounts of paperwork involved in getting anything done, e.g., "this requires a one dee ten tee form".[citation needed]
