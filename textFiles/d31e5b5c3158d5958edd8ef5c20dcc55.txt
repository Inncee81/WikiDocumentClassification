The Major Arcana (Trumps Major, Major Trumps) of occult or divinatory tarot consists of twenty two cards. The name Major Arcana was first used by Paul Christian. [1] Each Major Arcanum depicts a scene, mostly featuring a person or several people, with many symbolic elements. In many decks, each has a number (usually in Roman numerals) and a name, though not all decks have both, and some have only a picture. The earliest decks bore unnamed and unnumbered pictures on the Majors (probably because a great many of the people using them at the time were illiterate), and the order of cards was not standardized.[citation needed] Nevertheless, one of the most common sets of names and numbers is as follows:


Number
Name


0
The Fool


1
The Magician, The Mountebank, or The Juggler


2
The High Priestess or The Popess


3
The Empress


4
The Emperor


5
The Hierophant or The Pope


6
The Lovers


7
The Chariot


8 or 11
Strength


9
The Hermit


10
Wheel of Fortune


11 or 8
Justice


12
The Hanged Man or The Traitor


13
Death or The Trump with No Name


14
Temperance


15
The Devil


16
The Tower or The House of God


17
The Star


18
The Moon


19
The Sun


20
Judgment or The Angel


21
The World


The images on the Major Arcana are often very heavy with symbolism, with far more to the illustration than a mere depiction of the card title. The Major Arcana are usually regarded as relating to matters of higher purpose or deep significance, as opposed to the Minor Arcana which relate to the everyday world and matters of immediate significance.[citation needed]
