[edit] History

[edit] Early days as Brawl (1994–1996)
Originally, Disturbed was known as Brawl, a band whose lineup consisted of vocalist Erich Awalt, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren, and bassist Steve "Fuzz" Kmak. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape and the other three members went on advertising for a singer. They posted an ad in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the "Illinois Entertainer".[4]
David Draiman had answered the ad after going to twenty other auditions that month.[4] As guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman, "You know, out of all the singers, that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that". Donegan also went on to say, "I think just to walk in a room with men that you don't know and to have the balls to say, 'Let's just, you know, let's just jam'."[4] With regards of Draiman being the new singer for the band, Donegan said, "After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge. And I'm sitting there...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, 'cause I don't want to, you know...[say] 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here'." As drummer Mike Wengren commented, "We clicked right off the bat."[4]
Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and he re-named the band Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he decided to re-name the band Disturbed, Draiman said, "It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense."[5]

[edit] The Sickness (1998–2000)
Main article: The Sickness
After re-naming the band, Disturbed started to record several demos and played in live shows. The band eventually signed with Giant Records. In 2000, the band released its debut album, titled The Sickness, which launched the band into stardom. The album peaked at number twenty-nine on the Billboard 200[6] and it has sold over four million copies in the United States since its release.[7] The song "Down with the Sickness", a lounge cover version (by Richard Cheese) of which was used in the film Dawn of the Dead, was championed by radio station WXQR-FM (Rock 105) in North Carolina and placed into "heavy rotation" by program director Brian Rickman. The song was quickly added by radio stations such as WAAF in Boston and KROQ-FM in Los Angeles following its success. The song has since become very popular and was later used in many film soundtracks, and still is used a great deal to this day.
Soon after the release of The Sickness, Disturbed released a revamped cover version of "Stone Cold" Steve Austin's theme music for WWE, titled "Glass Shatters". Disturbed performed "Glass Shatters" live at WWE New York in October 2000 on the debut episode of MTV Sunday Night Heat.[8][unreliable source?] This theme song will also be re-used for Steve Austin's 2009 WWE Hall of Fame induction cermony, after a 8 year period. Disturbed headlined Ozzy Osbourne's Ozzfest tour in 2001 alongside Black Sabbath, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Black Label Society, and Crazy Town. Afterwards, the band started the Music as a Weapon Tour. The bands Adema, Drowning Pool, Stereomud, and Systematic were featured on the tour alongside Disturbed.
Before joining Marilyn Manson's 2001 European tour, Disturbed's bassist Steve Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle. Kmak injured his ankle by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed's rehearsal hall in Chicago a few days before Christmas.[9] He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. After a successful operation, doctors highly recommended that he skip the tour to avoid more severe damage to his foot. But he did perform with the band on January 11 and 12, 2001 at Disturbed's show in Chicago. A bass player named Marty O'Brian was recruited and filled Kmak's spot until Kmak was able to play again.

[edit] Believe (2001–2003)
Main article: Believe
On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a documentary DVD about the band, titled M.O.L., which showed some of the band's more personal moments in the studio and during tours, as well as featuring several music videos and live performances.[10] It also featured a music video for a song that had never previously been on an album, titled "Perfect Insanity", as well as another B-side track, titled "A Welcome Burden", played by the band in the studio.
On September 17, 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album, titled Believe, which debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200.[11] The music video for the first single from the album, titled "Prayer", was pulled from most television stations, due to the similarities it had with the September 11, 2001 attacks.[12]
David Draiman recorded vocals for a song titled "Forsaken", a track written and produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn, released on Queen of the Damned. In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours, titled Music as a Weapon II. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and Unloco toured with them.[13] During the tour, Disturbed debuted an unreleased song, titled "Dehumanized".[14]
In early 2003, after Disturbed had finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, the band experienced the departure of Steve Kmak, who was fired for "personal differences."[15] He was replaced by John Moyer,[16] who is now the current bass player. On the night Moyer became the band's new bass player, Disturbed played live at the House of Blues and performed two new songs, "Hell" and "Monster", both of which became B-side tracks on the band's third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists.[16]

[edit] Ten Thousand Fists (2004–2006)
Main article: Ten Thousand Fists
Disturbed toured with 10 Years and Ill Niño in support of their third studio album, Ten Thousand Fists, released worldwide on September 20, 2005. The album debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200, while also selling around 238,000 copies in its first week of release.[17] The album was certified platinum in the United States on January 5, 2006.[18] In an article, it was stated that twenty songs were recorded for the album, but only fourteen made it to the final track listing.[19] The remaining tracks included "Hell", which was released on the "Stricken" single; the track "Monster" was originally released as part of an iTunes pre-order package for the first people who pre-ordered Ten Thousand Fists, then the track was released on the Ten Thousand Fists Tour Edition, along with the track "Two Worlds"; and the track "Sickened" was released on the "Land of Confusion" single.
A month after the release of Ten Thousand Fists, Disturbed headlined the Jägermeister Music Tour along with the band Corrosion of Conformity. Disturbed supplied the song "Stricken" for WWE's New Year's Revolution 2006. In April 2006, the band completed an Australian tour supporting Korn and sharing the tour with 10 Years and Hatebreed. In mid 2006, a European tour was scheduled but had been moved twice due to the band's frontman having troubles with his voice.[20]

I had been taking Prevacid for about four years and my body built up a resistance to it, to the point where it wasn't doing anything anymore...I had a night of drinking in London followed by a full day and night of drinking on a day off in Dublin, because what else is there to do in Ireland but drink? That, coupled with a show where I had monitor problems, and I pretty much trashed my voice.[21]

In late 2006, David Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice. It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road.[22] Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with Ozzy Osbourne, System of a Down, Lacuna Coil, DragonForce, Avenged Sevenfold, and Hatebreed. The band also went on the European tour that had been previously moved twice earlier in 2006. Disturbed headlined another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them.[23]
Draiman became involved in the music file sharing controversy by publicly speaking out against the RIAA's lawsuits against file sharing individuals, despite the fact his record label is a member of the RIAA.

This is not rocket science. Instead of spending all this money litigating against kids who are the people they're trying to sell things to in the first place, they have to learn how to effectively use the Internet. For the artists, my ass...I didn't ask them to protect me, and I don't want their protection.[24]

Draiman also told NYRock:

[I'm] Very positive about the internet, Napster. I think it's a tremendous tool for reaching many more people than we ever could without it. When you release music you want it to be heard by people. Artists really want to have their music heard. They want to have their creation heard by people. Nothing is going to do that better than Napster. I can't tell you how many kids have come up to me and said, 'I downloaded a couple of tunes off Napster and I went out and bought the album.' Or they say, 'I want to come see you play.' I don't really make money off of record sales anyway.[25]

Disturbed completed the first leg of their Music as a Weapon III tour in late 2006. Soon after, Draiman stated that there was not going to be a second leg to the tour and that instead the band was going off the road to start working on their fourth studio album.[26] In July 2007, a new track titled "This Moment" was released on the soundtrack to the film Transformers.

[edit] Indestructible (2008–present)
Main article: Indestructible

The band mixed their fourth studio album, titled Indestructible[27], in Los Angeles, California in late 2007.[28] In an earlier interview, David Draiman said that they were going to record fifteen songs, but only twelve would be on the album.[29]
On March 6, 2008, the band released a thirty second sample of a newly re-recorded version of the song "Perfect Insanity" on their MySpace profile. In March 2008, the song was made available for full download on the band's website, which led to the song receiving some minor radio airplay, and the band playing it live in Kuwait during a special Operation MySpace event.[30]
Indestructible's first single, "Inside the Fire" was made available on digital distribution services for purchase on March 25, 2008. The band also toured in the United States in April and May 2008 with the bands Five Finger Death Punch and Art of Dying.[31] The music video for "Inside the Fire" was released on May 2, 2008 on the band's official website. Disturbed released their previously free song "Perfect Insanity" on iTunes Store as a second single on May 6, 2008, and the album Indestructible become available for pre-order for the release date on June 3, 2008.
On May 13, 2008, Harmonix, the developers of the video game Rock Band announced they had reached a deal with Disturbed and Best Buy to offer two tracks from Indestructible for play in Rock Band to those who pre-ordered the album from Best Buy's website. On June 3, 2008, Harmonix released three tracks from Indestructible; "Indestructible", "Inside the Fire", and "Perfect Insanity". Disturbed played their first live online concert on May 29, 2008. The concert was sponsored by Pepsi and Deep Rock Drive.[32] They performed in Las Vegas.
Indestructible was released in the United States on June 3, 2008 and in Australia on June 7, 2008 and became the band's third consecutive number-one debut on the Billboard 200. A special "Internet Only" limited edition of the album that includes the B-side track "Run", a making-of DVD with instructional videos, wrap-around poster, VIP laminate, access to special Disturbed events, and a special website with exclusive video, rare audio and more was also released.[33] The band toured in support of the "Mayhem Festival" alongside Slipknot, DragonForce, and Mastodon during summer of 2008.[34] Disturbed also completed a tour of Australia and New Zealand through August and September 2008.
On September 30, 2008, the band released an iTunes-exclusive live album entitled Live & Indestructible, made up of songs from Deep Rock Drive, as well as the music video for "Indestructible".[35] The band started a tour of Europe, starting in London during October 2008 and finishing during November 2008 in Helsinki.[36] In November and December 2008, Disturbed toured in the United States.[37]
On November 12, 2008, Disturbed announced that the next single from Indestructible will be "The Night". David Draiman also briefly talked about the next album, stating that it's lyrical themes will be as dark as Indestructible's, if not darker, due to a recent relationship break-up and other problems that are still happening in his life.[38]
The band is also planning to begin their Music as a Weapon IV tour in March 2009. The tour, now dubbed a festival, will feature Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira on the main stage.[39] The song "Inside the Fire" was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award in the "Best Hard Rock Performance" category.

[edit] Mascot
Disturbed's mascot, named The Guy, has been featured as a fully animated character in the music video for 'Land of Confusion' and has appeared on the covers of two of Disturbed's albums, Ten Thousand Fists and Indestructible. The Guy was originally just a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the The Sickness album and later in the music video for "Stupify". After being just a drawing, The Guy has become the official mascot for the band, fully animated by Spawn creator Todd McFarlane. The Guy got his name from Mike Wengren's nephew, who used to be afraid of The Guy's face, saying "That's the guy! That's the guy, isn't it!".[40]
On April 3,2009 Disturbed released the video for their single The Night

[edit] Style and lyrical themes
Classified by most as a rock,[41][42][43] or nu metal[44][45][46][47][48][49] band, Disturbed is also regarded by some critics as alternative rock[48][42] alternative metal,[50] heavy metal[50][51][52] and rap metal.[50] However, when asked about die-hard heavy metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, frontman David Draiman stated:

"We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days."[53]

Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano described the album Believe as "taking the sort of jump that their heroes in Soundgarden and Pantera made after their respective breakthrough records".[54] He also described the title track as moving "from a brutal chug to a sweeping chorus that suddenly stops in its tracks and turns into a winding riff that recalls the work of vintage James Hetfield".
According to frontman David Draiman on the band's home documentary M.O.L., the lyrics that he writes are inspired by life experience, perception, and actual experiences of his own, and he stated that he likes to present his ideas with cryptic lyrics.[4]
