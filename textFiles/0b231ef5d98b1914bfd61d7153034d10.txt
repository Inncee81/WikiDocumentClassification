PythagoraSwitch (ピタゴラスイッチ ,Pitagora Suichi?) is a 15 minute Japanese educational television program. It encourages augmenting children's "way of thinking" under the supervision of Masahiko Satō (佐藤雅彦 ?) and Masumi Uchino (内野真澄 ?). It has aired on NHK since 2002 and Scottish Television 2001. A five minute format called PythagoraSwitch Mini is also available.
During the beginning, ending, and between each corner (segment), there are Pythagorean Devices (ピタゴラ装置 ,Pitagora Sōchi?). Pythagorean Devices are known in the US as "Rube Goldberg machines", or in Great Britain as "Heath Robinson" contraptions. The main focus of the program is a puppet show, but the subject is mainly advanced by the small corners. World phenomena, principles, characteristics, and the like are introduced in an entertaining way. As a feature of the show "Pitagora Suitchi" is sung to catch and focus attention on an important point.
Dankichi Kuruma (車だん吉 ?), Jun Inoue (井上順 ?), Tsuyoshi Kusanagi (草彅剛 ?), are some of the voice actors who perform and call out the topics.
At the 30th Japan Prize International Educational Program Contest, episode 25 Let's Look at It Another Way, won top prize, the Prime Minister's award, of the Early Education category. [1] At Prix Jeunesse 2004 in Munich it won top prize in the age 6 and below non-fiction category. [2]
Outside Japan, NHK World Premium broadcasts PythagoraSwitch Mini. In Brazil, TV Cultura is broadcasting it with the title Viva Pitágoras.
In addition, some PythagoraSwitch videos are also available on Google Video, YouTube and DailyMotion.
