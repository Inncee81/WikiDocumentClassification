Apples to Apples is a party game originally published by Out of the Box Publishing, and now published by Mattel. It is designed for four to ten players.
There are several versions of Apples to Apples including: Apples to Apples (2001)[citation needed], Apples to Apples Junior 9+ (2002)[citation needed], Apples to Apples Kids, Apples to Apples: Jewish Version, and Apples to Apples: Bible Edition.
The game was chosen by Mensa International in 1999 as a "Mensa Select" prizewinner, an award given to five games each year.[1]
Apples to Apples was named "Party Game of the Year" in the December 1999 issue of Games magazine[2] and received the National Parenting Center's seal of approval in May 1999.[3]

[edit] Rules
Each player is dealt seven "red apple" cards; on each is printed a noun or noun phrase (such as "Madonna", "Canada", "The Spanish Inquisition", "Michael Jackson", etc.).
The judge (a chosen player) draws a "green apple" card on which is printed an adjective ("scary", "frightening", "patriotic", etc.), and places it face-up on the table for everybody to see. Then each player (except the judge) chooses a card that they think is the best match for the green apple card, and places it face-down. The judge shuffles the red apple cards, reads them (often aloud), and decides which noun is the best match for the adjective. This decision is subjective; the official rules encourage the judge to pick the match that is "most creative, humorous or interesting". Some might think it humorous if "mud" is played for delicious, and might give that player the point.
The player who submitted the chosen red apple card wins the round, and takes the green apple card to signify the win. All players then draw red cards until they have seven again, and the role of "judge" may pass to another person (generally going to the next player in line, though some rules have the round's winner becoming "judge"). Some editions of the game suggest discounting the last red-apple card played, to encourage players to place their cards down more quickly.
The winner is the first player to accumulate a pre-designated number of green apple cards; the more players, the lower the total.

[edit] Equipment




Seven red cards with one backwards showing the logo


The original boxed set contained:

108 green cards (green apples) each of which has an adjective printed on one side.
324 red cards (red apples) each of which has a noun printed on one side.


A tray for holding the cards.

Four expansion sets were available adding 72 extra green apple cards and 216 extra red apple cards each. In 2002, Expansion Set 3 won the Origins Award for Best Card Game Expansion or Supplement of 2002.
As of 2005[update], the original set and its expansions have been retired and replaced by a Party Box with the combined contents of the basic set and its first two expansions, and Party Box Expansion 1 set with the combined contents of the third and fourth expansions, and a Party Box Expansion 2, which contains new cards. A junior edition is also available. There are also Bible, British Isles, German, and Yiddish versions available.
On September 7, 2007, Out of the Box Publishing sold the rights for Apples to Apples to Mattel.[4]
