It has been suggested that Kinesiology tape be merged into this article or section. (Discuss)







The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject. Please improve this article or discuss the issue on the talk page. (October 2008)

Wiktionary, the free dictionary.


This article is about the scientific study of human movement.  For other uses, see Kinesiology (disambiguation).
Kinesiology, also known as Human Kinetics, is the science of human movement. It focuses on how the body functions and moves. A kinesiological approach applies scientific based medical principles towards the analysis, preservation and enhancement of human movement in all settings and populations.[1] Kinesiologists work in research, the fitness industry, clinically, and in industrial environments.[2] Studies on human motion may be supported by computer vision, using stereo camera systems for pose recognition and motion modeling.[3][4]
It is not to be confused with Applied Kinesiology, a controversial alternative medicine technique.

[edit] Basics

In North America, kinesiologists are conferred a Bachelor of Science degree (or higher) in Kinesiology or Human Kinetics, while in Australia or New Zealand, they are often conferred an Applied Science (Human Movement) degree (or higher).
Kinesiologists assess human movement, performance, and function by applying the sciences of biomechanics, anatomy, physiology, and motor learning.
Kinesiologists are involved in the rehabilitation, prevention, and management of disorders to maintain, rehabilitate, or enhance movement, function or performance in the areas of sport, recreation, work, and exercise.
Kinesiologists also provide consulting services, conduct research, and develop policies related to rehabilitation, human motor performance, ergonomics, and occupational health and safety.


[edit] Scope of practice
The practice of Kinesiology is the assessment of movement, performance, and function; and the rehabilitation, prevention, and management of disorders to maintain, rehabilitate, and enhance movement, performance, and function in the areas of sport, recreation, work, exercise, and general activities of daily living.[5]

[edit] Licensing, regulations
Kinesiology was made a regulated health profession in the province of Ontario in the summer of 2007 [6] and similar proposals have been made for other Canadian provinces.
In the United States, the American Kinesiology Association is the national kinesiology organization of university departments providing professional information about kinesiology degree programs.[7]

[edit] Health services

Health Promotion: Kinesiologists working in the health promotion industry focus on working with individuals to enhance the health, fitness, and well-being of the individual. Kinesiologists can be found working in fitness facilities, personal training/corporate wellness facilities, and industry.


Clinical/Rehabilitation: Kinesiologists work with individuals with disabling conditions to assist in regaining their optimal physical function. They work with individuals in their home, fitness facilities, rehabilitation clinics, and at the worksite. They also work alongside physiotherapists.


Ergonomics: Kinesiologists work in industry to assess suitability of design of workstations and provide suggestions for modifications and assistive devices.


Health and Safety: Kinesiologists are involved in consulting with industry to identify hazards and provide recommendations and solutions to optimize the health and safety of workers.


Disability Management/Case Coordination: Kinesiologists recommend and provide a plan of action to return an injured individual to their optimal function in all aspects of life.


Management/Research/Administration/Health and Safety: Kinesiologists frequently fulfill roles in all above areas, perform research, and manage businesses.[8]
