State Route 1, often called Highway 1, is a state highway that runs along much of the Pacific coast of the U.S. state of California. It is famous for running by some of the most beautiful coastlines in the world, leading to its designation as an All-American Road.
In Southern California, the California Legislature has designated the segment between Interstate 5 in Dana Point and U.S. Route 101 near Oxnard as Pacific Coast Highway (commonly referred to as PCH for short); between U.S. Route 101 at the Las Cruces junction (8 miles south of Buellton) and U.S. Route 101 in Pismo Beach and between U.S. Route 101 in San Luis Obispo and U.S. Route 101 in San Francisco, the legislature has designated State Route 1 as the Cabrillo Highway; and between Manzanita Junction near Marin City and U.S. Route 101 in Leggett, the legislature has designated State Route 1 Shoreline Highway. However, subsequent to naming the highway the Pacific Coast Highway, Cabrillo Highway, and Shoreline Highway, the legislature has given some segments of Route 1 additional names as described in the State Law section. In addition, some segments have been given alternative names by local governments.
This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System[2] and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, which limits development close to the highway.[3]

[edit] Orange County
At its southernmost end, Route 1 terminates at Interstate 5 in Capistrano Beach, just south of San Juan Capistrano. With the name Pacific Coast Highway, it then travels north into downtown Dana Point, where, for one mile (1.6 km), northbound traffic continues along the original PCH alignment while southbound traffic is diverted onto parallel Del Prado. After the two roads merge into PCH, Route 1 then heads north along the coast through Laguna Beach and Crystal Cove State Park.




Southbound PCH near Laguna Beach.


Route 1 then enters Newport Beach, where its name is changes to simply Coast Highway. It passes through several affluent neighborhoods, including Newport Coast and Corona Del Mar, and spans the entrance to the Upper Newport Bay. Upon entering Huntington Beach, Route 1 regains the designation of Pacific Coast Highway. It passes Huntington State Beach and Bolsa Chica State Beach, and passes through the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. It continues along the coast into Seal Beach, the final city in Orange County. 
[edit] Los Angeles and Ventura Counties
PCH then enters Los Angeles County and the city of Long Beach and continues in a northwesterly direction to meet Lakewood Boulevard State Route 19 (and Los Coyotes Diagonal at the Long Beach Traffic Circle) more than two miles (3 km) from the coast. From the traffic circle it continues inland in a westerly direction through Long Beach including approximately one mile adjacent to the southern boundary of Signal Hill. Although bypassing the immediate coastline of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, State Route 1 retains the PCH name as it continues westerly through the Los Angeles districts of Wilmington and Harbor City, and the cities of Lomita and Torrance. It then turns northerly through the cities of Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Upon entering Manhattan Beach, it becomes Sepulveda Boulevard, and continues through El Segundo and Los Angeles International Airport, directly passing underneath two runways. Metro Local 232 operates on most of this portion of CA-1.




Southbound Ca-1 between Santa Monica and LAX.


After leaving LAX, Route 1 then turns northwesterly, becoming Lincoln Boulevard and passing through the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Westchester, Playa Vista, Marina Del Rey, and Venice. It then enters the city of Santa Monica, where Route 1 turns southwest, merging onto the final segment of the Santa Monica Freeway. Santa Monica Big Blue Bus 3 and Rapid 3 operates on most of this portion of CA- 1. Passing through the McClure Tunnel, Route 1 emerges along the beachfront in Santa Monica and continues along the coast; it is known locally also as Palisades Beach Road, and formerly as Roosevelt Highway. Upon leaving Santa Monica, it once again regains the name PCH as it follows the coast, curving westbound through the neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, passing the Getty Villa before reaching the city of Malibu. The PCH is the main thoroughfare through Malibu, spanning the entire 21 miles (34 km) of the city, providing access to Pepperdine University and Zuma Beach.




The PCH passes Mugu Rock at Point Mugu.


Leaving Malibu, Route 1 crosses into Ventura County and continues along the coast through Point Mugu State Park to just beyond the park's western boundary. Approaching the Oxnard plain it passes through a notch in the mountain that forms Point Mugu. The cut left a very large rock formation at the tip of the point that is called the Mugu Rock. At that point, PCH leaves the coast and heads northerly and then northwesterly along the northeastern boundary of Naval Air Station Point Mugu for several miles and continues to Wooley Road in Oxnard. From the South Oxnard railroad grade crossing north of Statham Boulevard in Oxnard to Wooley Road, State Route 1 is known locally as Oxnard Boulevard. At Wooley Road the direction of State Route 1 changes from northwest to north; however, the Oxnard Boulevard name continues to Vineyard Avenue, Route 232. From Vineyard Avenue, State Route 1 continues north as PCH and joins U.S. Route 101 in Oxnard approximately five miles inland from the coast. It is noted that about a seven-mile (11 km) stretch of PCH between Calleguas Creek near the south boundary of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station and the South Oxnard railroad grade crossing north of Statham Boulevard was built to freeway standards.[citation needed] However, today only part of that stretch, from Calleguas Creek to Pleasant Valley Road in Oxnard, a distance of over five miles (8 km), is operating as a freeway. The remaining distance from Pleasant Valley Road to the railroad grade crossing is operating as an expressway (including three signalized intersections).

[edit] Central Coast
After traveling through Ventura, State Route 1 separates from US 101 to travel along the beach from Emma Wood State Beach to the Mobil Pier Undercrossing, where it rejoins US 101 about 3 miles (4.8 km) south of the Santa Barbara County line near La Conchita. State Route 1 then merges with US 101 (although signage is nonexistent) for 54 miles (87 km), passing through Santa Barbara. Route 1, now named Cabrillo Highway, splits again from US 101 north of the Gaviota Tunnel, and heads through the coastal cities of Lompoc, Guadalupe, and Grover Beach before joining US 101 for the third time at Pismo Beach.




View of the Pacific Ocean from the Bixby Bridge


State Route 1 splits from US 101 at San Luis Obispo and resumes as Cabrillo Highway continuing north as a freeway through Morro Bay. where it crosses Morro Creek at the site of a prehistoric Chumash settlement dating to the Millingstone Horizon.[4] Thence State Route 1 proceeds north to Cayucos until it again becomes a winding, two lane road with occasional passing lanes. It follows along the coast through San Simeon, past the elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas Lighthouse, and to the cliffs of Big Sur. Then several miles north, the highway crosses the scenic Bixby Creek Bridge, a reinforced concrete arch with a 320-foot (98 m) span that passes over the Bixby Creek gorge, and the Rocky Creek Bridge. The highway between San Simeon and Carmel was built between 1919 and 1937.




Looking south showing the McWay Rocks island group, about 16½ miles south of Big Sur.


From there, State Route 1 passes through Carmel before becoming a freeway in Monterey. The freeway portion of Route 1 from Route 68 (west) to Munras Avenue opened in 1960. The segment from Munras Avenue in Monterey to the northern border of Sand City and Seaside opened in 1968, and bypasses the original highway alignment of Munras Avenue and Fremont Street in Monterey, and Fremont Boulevard through Seaside. North of Seaside, the freeway was built over the original SR 1 alignment through Fort Ord in 1973. North of Fort Ord, SR 1 veers to the left of the original alignment and bypasses Marina to the west. This segment including the interchange with Route 156 and the short, 2-lane Castroville Bypass opened in 1976. Originally Route 1 followed the Route 156 alignment to the Route 183 intersection in Castroville, then turned northwest, following the present-day Route 183 through Castroville before rejoining its existing alignment at the northern terminus of the Castroville Bypass.
At the interchange with State Route 156 near Castroville, SR 1 continues north as a 2-lane rural road to Moss Landing. Despite heavy traffic on this segment, it was not upgraded to a freeway because doing so would require cutting through a wildlife refuge area east of Moss Landing. Another freeway segment begins at Salinas Road, near Pajaro in northern Monterey County, and continues to the State Route 17 interchange at Santa Cruz. Upon reaching downtown Santa Cruz, it continues as Mission Street and Coast Road before regaining the Cabrillo Highway name.

[edit] San Francisco Bay Area and the Redwood Empire




Scene from SR 1 near Half Moon Bay


SR 1 then continues north as a winding, two lane road following the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing through Half Moon Bay. Before the completion of the present highway in 1937, a narrow, winding, steep road known as Pedro Mountain Road connected Montara with Pacifica. That highway was completed in 1914 and provided competition to the Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated between San Francisco and Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920.
Before reaching Pacifica, the highway travels through a treacherous stretch where it is dubbed Devil's Slide. Here the road is in constant danger of sliding into the Pacific Ocean. This stretch of road is periodically closed, the last time from April 2, 2006 to August 3, 2006. Previous closures include about five months in 1995 and about three months in 1983.[5] To avoid these problems, a tunnel is being constructed to bypass the slide area, opening in 2011 according to Caltrans.




The Golden Gate Bridge, which Route 1 shares with US 101


SR 1 turns into a multi-lane freeway in Pacifica before joining Interstate 280 in Daly City. SR 1 used to run along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City but this segment was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. A small stub remains near Thornton Beach. Just short of reaching the city of San Francisco, Route 1 splits from Interstate 280 and the Cabrillo Highway designation ends at the Daly City / San Francisco border, where the road becomes Junipero Serra Boulevard. Shortly thereafter, the highway makes a slight left, becoming the six-lane wide 19th Avenue where, in spite of being a city street, it retains a dense traffic flow. Route 1 turns into Park Presidio Boulevard after it passes through the city's Golden Gate Park and the Presidio of San Francisco, where it goes through the General Douglas MacArthur Tunnel. It then joins US 101 for a fourth time on the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge known as Doyle Drive.




Route 1 winds along the Marin County coast


After crossing the bridge and entering Marin County, SR 1 then splits from US 101 again near Marin City, where it leaves the city and, as the Shoreline Highway, returns to a winding, two lane road as it passes over the Marin Hills to rejoin the coast at Muir Beach. Leaving the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the highway passes the Point Reyes National Seashore and Tomales Bay, eventually leaving Marin County and entering Sonoma County just south of Bodega Bay, where its name changes to Coast Highway. It winds along the rugged coast, crossing the Gualala River and entering Mendocino County. The highway enters the city of Point Arena, in which it becomes Main Street, before following School Street to the northwest and then becoming Shoreline Highway once again. The next and final major city along Route 1 is Fort Bragg. Continuing northward, the highway follows the coast for about 30 miles (48 km); it then cuts inland through mountainous terrain forested with redwoods, before terminating at US 101 in Leggett.

[edit] History
State construction of what is now Highway 1 started after the state's third highway bond issue passed in 1919. At that time, California highways were not publicly referred to by any route numbers, and the Highway 1 name came about 15 years later. The legislature and Highway Department referred to roads either by a name or as "Legislative Route Numbers." The first two approved sections of what is now Highway 1 were Legislative Route 56 from San Simeon to Carmel (connecting with existing county highways at each end) and Legislative Route 60 from Oxnard via the coast to San Juan Capistrano, intended as links in a continuous coastal roadway from Oregon to Mexico.[6][7] A 1921 law extended Legislative Route 56 south over the county road to Cambria,[8] and Legislative Route 60 was extended from Oxnard to El Rio (midway to Ventura, now the site of the Oxnard Boulevard interchange with US 101) in 1925. The latter law, in theory, made Legislative Route 60 a continuous coastal loop, with both ends at what became US 101 in Oxnard and at Capistrano Beach (since 1964 the southern terminus of Highway 1 at Interstate 5 in Orange County). [9] Legislative Route 56 was extended further south from Cambria to connect to present-day US 101 in San Luis Obispo in 1931.[10]
A large expansion of the state highway system in 1933 resulted in Legislative Route Number 56 being extended in both directions. To the south, a second section was added, beginning at Pismo Beach on US 101 (Legislative Route 2) and heading south through Guadalupe and Lompoc to rejoin US 101 at a junction called Los Cruces (sic), just north of Gaviota Pass. (A short piece near Orcutt and Los Alamos had been part of Legislative Route Number 2, which originally followed present SR 135 from Los Alamos to Santa Maria.) To the north, Legislative Route Number 56 was continued along the coast from Carmel through Santa Cruz to San Francisco. Several discontinuous pieces were added north of San Francisco, one from Legislative Route Number 1 (US 101) north of the Golden Gate to the county line near Valley Ford, another from the Russian River near Jenner (where the new Route 104 ended) to Westport, and a third from Ferndale to Route 1 near Fernbridge. Except for the gaps in Legislative Route Number 56 north of San Francisco, these additions completed the coastal highway, with other sections formed by Legislative Route Numbers 1, 2, and 71.[11][12]
California Route 1 is a famous brand name around the world now, but California 1 was called several other names and numbers prior to 1964. When the road was first envisioned in the World War I era, it was referred to either by a highway name or by a "Legislative Route Number" or LRN. LRNs were used by state highway planners and the Legislature from 1915 until 1964, but were never posted on highways, referred to by the auto clubs or public, nor used on maps. Various portions of State Route 1 have been posted and referred to by various names and numbers over the years. The section of Highway 1 from Santa Monica to Oxnard, via Malibu, went out to contract in 1925 as "Coast Boulevard" but was designated "Theodore Roosevelt Highway" when it was dedicated in 1929.
California Highway 1 signs first went up after California decided to number its highways, in 1934. But only the section from Santa Barbara County north was posted as Highway 1, that section of the road known Legislative Route Number 56 (Las Cruces to Fernbridge, including the gaps). In Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, Legislative Route Number 60 (San Juan Capistrano to the Oxnard area) became California Highway 3, and a few Route 3 signs were actually posted [13]. But the Route 3 signs were replaced by "U.S. Route 101 Alternate" shields and strips by 1936, as the road was built out; this change also allowed the extension of US 66 to end at another U.S. Route, in Santa Monica. [14]
The gaps of non-state highway along the northern coast were finally filled in by the Legislature in 1951, though the Department of Public Works was not required to maintain the newly-added portions immediately. A short connection from near Rockport to Route 1 at Leggett was also included,[15] as the existing county road north from Rockport to Ferndale had not yet been paved.[16] The Leggett connection became State Route 208.[17]
The state Legislature in 1963 tossed out the old conflicting Legislative Route Numbers (1964 renumbering), got rid of some famous old U.S. routes (like U.S. 66), and renumbered many state highways. It abolished US 101A in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties and renumbered it as state Highway 1. The cover of "California Highways" magazine in fall 1964 shows state engineers posting the new shield at Point Mugu.[18]. The same year, the Legislature by state law named Route 1 "Pacific Coast Highway" in Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and "Cabrillo Highway" from San Luis Obispo north to San Francisco. Many cities, however, did not change the name of city streets that are part of Highway 1, such as Lincoln and Sepulveda boulevards in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and El Segundo, and Oxnard Boulevard.
In 1980, another section was added northwest of Ventura, when several miles of the old two-lane alignment of US 101 were posted as Route 1 where the freeway had bypassed it in about 1960. At its northern terminus, in 1984 SR 1 replaced SR 208, with the old alignment to Fernbridge, never constructed south of Ferndale, becoming SR 211.[19] This part of the Pacific coast, the only long section in California not served by a state highway, has been termed California's "Lost Coast".
