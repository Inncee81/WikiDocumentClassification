December 21 - The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, notably used by the Maya civilization among others of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, completes its thirteenth b'ak'tun cycle since the calendar's mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, according to the "GMT-correlation" JDN= 584283).[4] The Long Count b'ak'tun date of this starting point (13.0.0.0.0) is repeated, for the first time in a span of approximately 5,125 solar years. The significance of this period-ending to the pre-Columbian Maya themselves is unclear, and there is an incomplete inscription (Tortuguero Monument 6) that records this date. It is also to be found carved on the walls of the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque, where it functions as a base date from which other dates are computed.[5] This date figures prominently in the religious syncretism of New Age Mayanism. However, reputable Maya scholars such as Linda Schele and David Freidel[6] point out that the end of the current Mayan long count is not in fact due until day 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0 from the theoretical end of the previous world in 3114 BC (an 'end of the world' totally unknown either to history or to archeology) – which, with each column equal to twenty times its predecessor, lies some 41,341,049,999,999,999,999,999,994,879 years in the future.


December 23 - The alternative date for the completion of the thirteenth b'ak'tun cycle in the Maya calendar, using a version of the GMT-correlation based on a JDN of 584285 (a.k.a. the "astronomical" or "Lounsbury correlation"), which is supported by a smaller number of Mayanist researchers.[7]
December 31 - The Kyoto Protocol will expire.

Geophysical and cosmological
John Major Jenkins and others[12] believe that an alignment will occur when the sun rises above the horizon on December 21 2012, at which point the sun will rise in the middle of the Milky Way Galaxy, thus causing an alignment between the earth, sun, and the Galactic Center.[13] It is suggested that this event will cause numerous changes on Earth. However, the event is only a visual phenomenon from the Earth's perspective, which is caused by the precession of the equinoxes or the 26,000 year wobble of the earth, and thus only changes our perspective, not the actual position of the earth in relation to the galaxy. In short, there is no gravitational force or radiation that can be expected from this event because other than the tilt of the earth; nothing will be any different from what occurs during any other solstice. [14][15][16]
Michael Tsarion [17] and others think that an actual physical alignment of our entire solar system will occur with the horizontal plane of the Milky Way Galaxy on that day. The solar system is moving around the center of the galaxy every 225 million years or so, and while doing so is moving up and down in a cycle crossing the plane every 33 million years. According to the Journal Nature, however, there is evidence of the solar system crossing the galactic plane 3 million years ago. This would mean that we are moving away from the galactic plane, not toward it, and we will not be due to cross it for another 30 million years.[18]
There are also hypotheses that a currently unknown planet, sometimes referred to as planet X or Nibiru, which has an odd orbit that only enters the local solar system every 3600 years will return in 2012 causing many problems. [19] The idea is traced back to Zecharia Sitchin's translations of Sumerian texts, and specifically to his interpretation of the VA 243 cylinder seal, which he says shows that the Sumerians knew of 12 planets (sun, moon, and ten others). This idea has been challenged by his peers, most notably Michael Heiser.[20][21]
Among other possible predicted scenarios is that a shift of the Earth's magnetic poles may occur, and that this will leave the earth vulnerable to harmful radiation from the sun.[22] According to NASA magnetic pole reversal does not occur on a particular day or year, but over the course of thousands of years. Furthermore, the magnetic field does not vanish during this natural cycle, but becomes more complex as it makes the transition.[23]
Some proponents of the pole shift scenario claim that this shift would be a physical movement of the poles of the earth, and not simply a magnetic shift. This event is called a true polar wander. Earth has experienced a few degree shift in the past, but nowhere near a reversal, and there is no reason to suggest this is likely or even possible. According to William Sager, a Texas A&M Oceanographer, this event could not happen on a particular day or year but only over a long period of time. [24]
Recently, two large "leaks" have been identified in Earth's magnetic field, with interaction to solar wind opposite to that of previous predictions. Solar storms of the next solar maximum, in 2012, are predicted to potentially cause electricity grid disruptions and blackouts, as well as possible disruptions to artificial satellites.[25]

Metaphysical
See also: 2012 Doomsday prediction
2012 is predicted by some with New Age beliefs to be a great year of spiritual transformation (or alternatively an apocalypse). This is in keeping with an uncodified, eclectic belief system referred to as Mayanism whose roots can be found in 16th century Christian eschatology affecting Maya texts such as the Popol Vuh and the Books of Chilam Balam that were written down after the Spanish Conquest. There is disagreement among believers whether 2012 will see an end of civilization or whether humanity will be elevated to a "higher" level.[26]. This latter belief represents a contemporary manifestation of models for human progress that derive from 19th century unilineal evolution.
Many esoteric sources[who?] interpret the completion of the thirteenth B'ak'tun cycle in the Long Count of the Maya calendar (which occurs on December 21 by the most widely held correlation) to mean there will be a major change in world order.
Several authors have published works which suspect that a major, world-changing event will take place in 2012:

The 1997 book The Bible Code by Michael Drosnin suggests that, according to certain algorithms of the Bible code, an asteroid or comet will collide with the Earth. Drosnin also states in his book that the Bible code only predicts possibilities.
The 2006 book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl by Daniel Pinchbeck discusses theories of a possible global awakening to psychic connection by the year 2012, creating a noosphere.
Riley Martin asserts that Biaviian aliens will allow passage aboard their 'Great Mother Ship' when the Earth is 'transformed' in 2012.
Terence McKenna's numerological novelty theory suggests a point of singularity in which humankind will go through a great shift in consciousness.
Dannion Brinkley, in his 2007 book, Secrets of the Light, a follow-up to his 1995 bestseller Saved by the Light, predicts "that by the year 2012 humanity will experience unprecedented mental and spiritual transformations, coinciding precisely with the Earth's passage through great physical upheaval" (Brinkley 96).[27]
