Julian Barbour 1937 - is a British physicist with research interests in quantum gravity. He is the author of The End of Time: The Next Revolution in Physics and Absolute or Relative Motion? Volume 1, The Discovery of Dynamics, later retitled The Discovery of Dynamics.
He holds the controversial view that time does not exist as anything other than an illusion, and that a number of physics' problems arise from assuming that it does exist. He argues that we have no evidence of the past other than our memory of it, and no evidence of the future other than our belief in it. "Change merely creates an illusion of time, with each individual moment existing in its own right, complete and whole. He calls these moments "Nows". It is all an illusion: there is no motion and no change. He argues that the illusion of time is what we interpret through what he calls "time capsules," which are "any fixed pattern that creates or encodes the appearance of motion, change or history."
Related work on the physics underlying the illusory nature of time can be found in "Memory Systems, Computation, and The Second Law of Thermodynamics", D. H. Wolpert, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 31, 743-785, 1992.
Barbour lives near Oxford, England. Since receiving his Ph.D. degree on the foundations of Einstein's general theory of relativity at the University of Cologne in 1968, he has supported himself and his family without a job in academia, working part-time as a translator.
