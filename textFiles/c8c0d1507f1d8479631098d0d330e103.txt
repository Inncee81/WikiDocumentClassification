Wim Crouwel, born in 1928 in Groningen, Netherlands, is a Dutch graphic designer and typographer.
He is known for his posters and exhibition design for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Crouwel has designed several font sets, of which the New Alphabet (1967) is best known. New Alphabet is a highly abstract font, based on a dot-matrix system. Crouwel intended it to be easily read and recognized by computers.
He has been and still is one of the most important designers in Dutch graphic history. In the years 1985-1993 he was director of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam
Crouwel is still an active member of the Dutch graphic design scene.
