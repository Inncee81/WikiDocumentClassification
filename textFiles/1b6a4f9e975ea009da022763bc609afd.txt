Best practice asserts that there is a technique, method, process, activity, incentive or reward that is more effective at delivering a particular outcome than any other technique, method, process, etc. The idea is that with proper processes, checks, and testing, a desired outcome can be delivered with fewer problems and unforeseen complications. Best practices can also be defined as the most efficient (least amount of effort) and effective (best results) way of accomplishing a task, based on repeatable procedures that have proven themselves over time for large numbers of people.
Despite the need to improve on processes as times change and things evolve, best-practice is considered by some as a business buzzword used to describe the process of developing and following a standard way of doing things that multiple organizations can use for management, policy, and especially software systems.
As the term has become more popular, some organizations have begun using "best practices" to refer to what are in fact 'rules', causing a linguistic drift in which a new term such as "good ideas" is needed to refer to what would previously have been called "best practices."

[edit] Exchange
Best practices in a particular industry or other professional field can be exchanged, just like any instructional capital, by any means, though Internet-related information is most commonly exchanged this way:

source code
e-democracy
e-government

There are numerous such efforts now in government especially in the English speaking world:

Federation of Canadian Municipalities FCM InfraGuide
U.S. government Government Open Code Collaborative
UK local democracy project which calls this a knowledge pool

An emerging trend looms that many international organizations like to use 'best practice" methodology to promote the good systems, procedures of one country among its members.
At the same time, careful evaluation is needed before adopting any so-called best practice. One person's best practice is not necessarily the best for another person, company, or country. Chasing the wrong best practice can have a negative impact, so the context and background for the best practice claim need to be understood in advance. [1]

[edit] Best practices domains
Domains where Best Practices have been applied include:

Teaching/Education
Incremental and iterative development
Quality assurance
Performance engineering
Risk management
Change process
Change Management
Release execution
Milestones
Release control
Defect tracking
Use case
Requirements management
Automated testing process
Nursing
Evidence-based medicine
Physical planning and land use management
Water pollution control, watershed protection and restoration
Local governance
Home care

Best practices are used in technology development, such as new software, but also in construction, transportation, business management, sustainable development, and various aspects of project management. Best practices are also used in healthcare to deliver high quality care that promotes best outcomes.
Best practices are used within any business type including, but not limited to: sales, manufacturing, teaching, programming software, road construction, health care, insurance, and accounting.
Documenting and charting these procedures and practices is a complicated and time-consuming process often skipped by companies, even though they may practice the proper processes consistently.
Some consulting firms specialize in the area of Best Practice. Often "best practice" consulting firms offer pre-made 'templates' to standardize business process documentation. A key strategic talent is required to provide good "best practice" consulting to organisations: the ability to balance the uniqueness of an organisation with practices it has in common with other organisations.
In many cases the cost of making modifications to a system or process which comes standard in a template or with a delivered computer application forces an organisation into using "best practice". Often it is to the benefit of the organisation. Sometimes a "best practice" will hurt an organisation. Good "best practice" consulting firms can assist organisations in making decisions appropriate for the organisation.

[edit] Good operating practice
Good operating practice is a strategic management term. More specific uses of the term include good agricultural practices, good manufacturing practice, good laboratory practice, good clinical practice and good distribution practice.
Because of the use of best-practice as a buzzword, some people are asking if a better term could be found. This could be something such as “better practices”, or “current thinking”.
The thinking is along these lines. The term “best practices” has implications of finality, obedience, authority, and universality. The term ‘best practices’ implies that some source has the final answer to a matter in dispute or disarray. The matter is closed, decided, set and resolved. The term seems to to seek better ways, which may even lead to tweaking the suggested practice to make it even better. It suggests that all of us together can come up with something better than any one of us can arrive at individually, and places authority in the community. The term may imply that the better practice is not universal, but depends on the specific situation.
