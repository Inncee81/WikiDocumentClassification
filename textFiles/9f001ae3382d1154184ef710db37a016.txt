if (wgNotice != '') document.writeln(wgNotice); List of Intel codenames

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Intel has historically named integrated circuit (IC) development projects after geographical names (since they can never be trademarked by someone else) of towns, rivers or mountains near the location of the Intel facility responsible for the IC. Many of these are in the American West, particularly in the state of Oregon (where most of Intel's CPU projects are designed; see well-known project codenames). As Intel's development activities have expanded, this nomenclature has expanded to Israel and India. Some older codenames refer to celestial bodies. There is a pattern with recent desktop processors. Since Core 2 all quad-core desktop processors tend to end in "field"(e.g. Kentsfield, Bloomfield, etc.)and all desktop dual-cores end in "dale"(e.g. Wolfdale, Allendale, Arandale)
The following table lists known Intel codenames along with a brief explanation of their meaning and their likely namesake.
