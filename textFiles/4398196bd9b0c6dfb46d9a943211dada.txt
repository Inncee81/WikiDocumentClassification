Operating system

Type
Personal video recorder


Website

GB-PVR is a PVR (personal video recorder) application, running on Microsoft Windows, whose main function is scheduling TV recordings and playing back live TV. This PVR also acts as a home media center with a 10-foot user interface design for the living-room TV, then it brings together in a single application a digital video recorder, a radio station online tuner, a music and movie player, a library of images, ...
Although GB-PVR supports open interfaces, the core engine code is closed. However developing personal plug-ins is an option to extend the application and these can be closed or open source, depending on the developer's interests. These plug-ins can be developed in C#, VB.NET or C++ and exist some examples available in the GB-PVR official Forums and the GB-PVR Documentation wiki websites. Moreover the software has been developed with an interface which allows to change the skin view or other graphic elements as the wallpaper.
GB-PVR is mostly an MPEG recording and playback system, but may also play other non-MPG content such as AVI (DivX/Xvid), WMV, and other formats that are supported by the codecs installed into a computer's.
It requires a supported TV tuner card, a VMR9 capable display adapter (video card), and a supported MPEG2 Decoder. Other requirements are listed on the GB-PVR web site.

Normally the plug-ins are distributed as zip files and they can be extract to the gbpvr root directory. When there is a skin which is not available in the plug-ins zip file, it has to be copied into the current skin directory.
Some plug-ins may be configured in the GB-PVR configuration tool, but most of them are configured by editing the plugins Manual/ Skin (skin.xml)

[edit] Client/Server support
When configuring the machine which is running GB-PVR, the possibilities are client and server mode. The server is responsible of recordings that the clients can schedule. Therefore clients do not need a recording service. A client PC just can watch tv and recordings from the server, which has to share them. Clients can also use the EPG which runs in the server. There are two different sharing modes:

Streaming (only supports MPEG2)
File sharing

Other clients supported:

Hauppauge MediaMVP
NMT (Network Media Tank)
