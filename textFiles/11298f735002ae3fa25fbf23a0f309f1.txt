From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. This should be contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions.
In general, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do whereas non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be. Non-functional requirements are often called qualities of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "constraints", "quality attributes", "quality goals" and "quality of service requirements". Qualities, that is, non-functional requirements, can be divided into two main categories:

Execution qualities, such as security and usability, which are observable at run time.
Evolution qualities, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the software system.


[edit] Examples
A system may be required to present the user with a display of the number of records in a database. This is a functional requirement. How up-to-date this number needs to be is a non-functional requirement. If the number needs to be updated in real time, the system architects must ensure that the system is capable of updating the displayed record count within an acceptably short interval of the number of records changing.
Sufficient network bandwidth may also be a non-functional requirement of a system.
Other examples:

Accessibility
Audit and control
Availability (see service level agreement)
Certification
Dependency on other parties
Documentation
Efficiency (resource consumption for given load)
Effectiveness (resulting performance in relation to effort)
Escrow
Extensibility (adding features, and carry-forward of customizations at next major version upgrade)
Legal and licensing issues
Interoperability
Maintainability
Open Source
Performance / Response time (see Performance Engineering)
Platform compatibility
Price
Portability
Quality (e.g. Faults Discovered, Faults Delivered, Fault Removal Efficacy)
Reliability (e.g. Mean Time Between Failures - MTBF)
Resilience
Resource constraints (processor speed, memory, disk space, network bandwidth etc. )
Response time
Robustness
Scalability (horizontal, vertical)
Security
Software, tools, standards etc. Compatibility
Stability
Safety
Supportability
Testability
Usability by target user community

For example: Online response times, timing of the company offices, security, back-up etc...
