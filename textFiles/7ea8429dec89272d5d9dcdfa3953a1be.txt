Let the Right One In (Swedish: Låt den rätte komma in), also known as Let Me In, is a 2004 vampire fiction novel by Swedish writer John Ajvide Lindqvist. The story centers on the relationship between a 12-year-old boy, Oskar, and a 200-year-old vampire child, Eli. It takes place in Blackeberg, a working class suburb of Stockholm, in the early '80s. The book focuses on the darker side of humanity, dealing with issues such as bullying, drugs, theft, pedophilia, prostitution and murder as well as the obvious supernatural themes.
The book was a bestseller in the author's home country of Sweden and has been translated into Danish, German, Russian and English in 2007. A Swedish language film version by the same name, directed by Tomas Alfredson, was released in 2008 to widespread critical acclaim. An English language remake, to be directed by Matt Reeves, is scheduled for release in 2010.

[edit] Synopsis
Oskar is a 12-year-old-boy who is being bullied at school. He befriends a mysterious child, Eli, who moves in next door with an older man, Håkan. Eli is revealed to be a vampire, but the two children develop a close relationship and Eli helps Oskar fight back against his tormentors.

[edit] Title
The title refers to the Morrissey song "Let the Right One Slip In"[1] (featured on the Viva Hate special edition album) but also to the aspect of vampire folk lore which says that vampires cannot enter a house unless invited.
The American version is called Let Me In because the publishers requested that Lindqvist change the title as they believed it was too long.[2]
There is also an American version under the title Let the Right One In.
