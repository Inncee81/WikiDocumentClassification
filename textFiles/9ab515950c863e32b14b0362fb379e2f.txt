The Woman Acceptance Factor (WAF) – sometimes referred to as Woman Approval Factor, Wife Acceptance Factor and more recently as Spouse Acceptance Factor (SAF) to accommodate gay and lesbian couples[1] – is the playful estimation of the acceptance or refusal of a new acquisition or project by the significant other. It relies on the cliché that men are driven by a certain geekiness when it comes to acquisitions like home theater or PCs, disregarding the stereotypically female aspects of aesthetics, design and practical/financial considerations, let alone ease-of-use. The first known WAF reference was in a 1989 article about wives rebellion against "oversized loudspeakers."[1]
The Woman Acceptance Factor is inversely proportional to the possible amount of conflict resulting from the different points of view. The lower the WAF, the more convincing needs to be done, or the more conflicts arises from the acquisition or project.
Potential for conflict lies in:

Questionable practical use / necessity
High initial acquisition cost and/or high running cost
Amount of time husband spends with the new purchase (in general the new equipment might create some further cause of separation, in space, time or simply distract the husband's attention)
Aesthetic deficiencies like large, ugly chassis or trunks of surface mounted cables
Necessary construction work like chiselling slits into walls
Constant noise from fans, hard drives etc.
Space considerations
Total number of remote controls under female control
Challenges imposed by beta-software, user-interface etc.

An example of a low WAF item might be a video projector with a makeshift ceiling mount and a huge trunk of black cables, which needs to warm up for 3 minutes before it can be used to watch the TV news, all operated using 3 different remote controls.
High WAF items are generally aesthetically designed, easy to use devices like the iPod, or computer furniture which hides cables and connectors.[2]
Recently, the Woman Acceptance Factor has also been applied to non-technical stereotypical male activities like attending sporting events or "hanging out with the guys."
