Dante Terrell Smith (born December 11, 1973)[1] is an Emmy- and Golden Globe-nominated American actor and a Grammy-nominated rapper known by the stage name Mos Def. Mos Def started his hip hop career in a group called Urban Thermo Dynamics, after which he appeared on albums by Da Bush Babees and De La Soul. With Talib Kweli, he formed the duo Black Star, who released the well-received album Black Star in 1998. He was a major force in the late 1990s underground hip hop explosion spearheaded by Rawkus Records. As a solo artist he has released the albums Black on Both Sides in 1999, The New Danger in 2004, and True Magic, 2006.[1]
Initially recognized for his musical output, Mos Def's screen work since the early 2000s has established him as one of only a handful of rappers who have garnered critical approval for their acting work. Mos Def has also been active on several social and political issues, and was particularly vocal in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[1]

[edit] Early life
Mos Def was born Dante Terrell Smith in the Roosevelt Houses of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York City,[2] the son of Darrell Toler. He has two younger brothers, Abdul Rahman (a.k.a. "Gold Medal Man," who is Mos's full-time DJ) and Anwar Superstar. He also has a younger sister, Ces (Casey) Smith. Mos Def and his brothers are all converts to Islam.[3] Mos Def was first exposed to Islam at age thirteen by his father. He became a Muslim at age nineteen after getting to know Muslim rappers including Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Q-Tip of the group A Tribe Called Quest.[2] Mos Def grew up during the golden age of hip-hop and has been rapping and acting since he was six years old. He attended Philippa Schuyler Middle School in Bushwick, Brooklyn. For high school, Mos Def attended Hudsonville High School after moving to Michigan.[4]

[edit] Rapping career

[edit] Urban Thermo Dynamics
Mos Def began his music career in 1994 in the short-lived group Urban Thermo Dynamics with his younger brother D.c.Q and younger sister Ces. Despite their contract with Payday Records, the group only released two singles, and their debut album Manifest Destiny was not released until 2004, when it was distributed by Illson Media. In 1996, he emerged as a solo artist and worked with De La Soul and da Bush Babees, before he released his own first single, "Universal Magnetic," which was a huge underground hit.[5]

[edit] Black Star
After signing with Rawkus Records, Mos Def and Talib Kweli formed the group Black Star, and released a full length album under the name, Mos Def and Talib Kweli are Black Star.[6] The album was released in 1998 and featured Hi-Tek as producer on most of the tracks. The album featured the hit singles, "Definition" and "Respiration." "Definition" was ranked eighty-fifth on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip-Hop.[7]

[edit] Black on Both Sides
Mos Def released his solo debut album Black on Both Sides in 1999 through Rawkus Records.[8] Black On Both Sides received "4 mics" (four stars) from The Source. Its singles of the album were, "Mathematics," "Umi Says." and "Ms. Fat Booty." A short time after the release of his first solo album, Mos Def appeared on the Scritti Politti album Anomie & Bonhomie. Mos Def was also featured on Rawkus's Lyricist Lounge and Soundbombing series of compilations.

[edit] The New Danger
After the collapse of Rawkus, he signed to Interscope/Geffen Records, which released his second solo album The New Danger in 2004.[9] The New Danger contained a mix of several musical genres, including soul, blues, and rock and roll, performed with his rock band Black Jack Johnson, which contained members of the bands Bad Brains and Living Colour. The singles included "Sex, Love & Money" and the B-side "Ghetto Rock"; the latter went on to receive several Grammy Award nominations in 2004.
Mos Def has drawn some criticism from his fan base about "keeping it real" after he appeared in a commercial that endorsed the GMC Denali sport utility vehicle.[10]

[edit] True Magic
Mos Def's final solo album for Geffen Records,True Magic, was quietly released on December 29, 2006. True Magic features production from The Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Minnesota, among others. The album was released in a clear-case with no cover art.
The song "Crime & Medicine" is essentially a cover of GZA's 1995 single "Liquid Swords", though it contains different verses. Also, the track "Undeniable" samples a version of the Barrett Strong/Norman Whitfield composition "Message from a Black Man". The song "Dollar Day" uses the same beat as Juvenile's "Nolia Clap."[11]
MTV reported that this album isn't a full version, but a teaser/promotional debut. A new version of the album would be released spring 2007, with updated songs and cover art. However, on October 17, 2007, Okayplayer reported, through discussions with Mos Def's management, that these rumors were unsubstantiated. The CD was intended to be released without promotion or cover art, as per Mos Def's request. There would be no future re-release.
In 2007, Mos Def released another solo album, Mos Definite. This album was released under the Frequent M (Groove Attack) label.

[edit] The Ecstatic
On November 7, 2007, Mos Def performed live in San Francisco at a venue called The Mezzanine. This performance was recorded for an upcoming "Live in Concert" DVD. During this performance Mos Def announced that he would be releasing a new album to be called The Ecstatic. He sang a number of new tracks, which may be appearing on an upcoming album. In recent shows Mos Def has shown crowds tracks produced by Madlib and has rumored to be going to Kanye West for new material. The album was said to be released in April 2008, but Mos Def quickly denied it. Producer and fellow Def Poet Al Be Back has revealed that he would be producing as well, and that Mos is "four or five records in" to the album.[12] It has been announced that the album will be released June 9, 2009.

[edit] Simpatico
Mos Def is also set to do a duo album with Jay Electronica entitled Simpatico. It will contain nine songs.[13]

[edit] Other Work
Mos Def appears alongside Kanye West on the track "Drunk and Hot Girls" and the bonus track "Good Night" off West's album, Graduation. Mos Def will also release a pair of Converse shoes.[14] He also appears on the debut album from fellow New Yorkers Apollo Heights on a track titled, "Concern." In October, he signed a deal with Downtown Records and appeared on a remix to the song "D.A.N.C.E." by Justice.[15] Mos Def appeared on Stephen Marley's album Mind Control on the song "Hey Baby." Mos Def is also planning on doing performances with Zak McDonald.
In April 2008 he appeared on the title track for a new album by The Roots entitled Rising Down. The new single, "Life in Marvelous Times", will be officially available through iTunes on November 4, 2009, and is currently available for stream on the Roots' website Okayplayer.

[edit] Acting career
Mos Def studied experimental theatre in New York University. He began his professional acting career at the age of fourteen, appearing in the TV movie God Bless the Child, starring Mare Winningham. He then played the oldest child in the short-lived family sitcom, You Take the Kids, starring Nell Carter and Roger E. Mosley. His most notable acting role before his music career was that of Bill Cosby's sidekick on the short-lived detective show, The Cosby Mysteries. He also starred in a 1996 Visa check card commercial featuring Deion Sanders.
After brief appearances in Bamboozled[16] and Monster's Ball,[17] Mos re-invigorated his acting career with his performance as a talented rapper who is reluctant to sign to a major label in Brown Sugar.[18] He was nominated for an Image Award and a Teen Choice Award.[19]
In 2002, he played the role of Booth in Suzan-Lori Parks' Topdog/Underdog, a Tony-nominated and Pulitzer-winning Broadway play. He also received positive notices as the quirky Left Ear in the blockbuster hit, The Italian Job in 2003.[20]
In television, Mos Def has appeared on Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show,[21] and has hosted the award-winning HBO spoken word show, Def Poetry since its inception.[22] The show's sixth season aired in 2007. He also appeared on the sitcom My Wife And Kids as the old school friend of Michael Kyle's (Damon Wayans).
Mos Def won Best Actor, Independent Movie at the 2005 Black Reel Awards for his portrayal of Detective Sgt. Lucas in The Woodsman.[23] For his portrayal of Vivien Thomas in HBO's film Something the Lord Made,[24] he was nominated for an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe, and won the Image Award. He then landed the role of Ford Prefect in the 2005 movie adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[25]
In 2006, Mos Def appeared in Dave Chappelle's Block Party alongside fellow Black Star companion Talib Kweli, while also contributing to the film's soundtrack.[26] Also, Mos Def was featured as the black banjo player in the infamous "Pixie Sketch" from Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes. He was later edited out of it on the DVD. Additionally, Mos Def starred in the action film 16 Blocks alongside Bruce Willis and David Morse.[27] He has a recurring guest role on Boondocks, starring as "Gangstalicious". He is also set to be in Toussaint, a film about Haitian revolutionary Toussaint L'Ouverture, opposite Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes. He made a cameo appearance — playing himself — in the movie Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.[28]
He also co-stars with Jack Black in the Michel Gondry movie Be Kind Rewind, playing a video rental store employee whose best friend Jerry (played by Jack Black) accidentally erases the store's tapes. The two protagonists then decide to refilm the deleted movies, becoming local celebrities in the process.[29]
Mos Def portrays Chuck Berry in the 2008 film Cadillac Records,[30] for which he was nominated for a Black Reel Award and an Image Award. Most recently, he appeared in the season five episode of House entitled "Locked In." His performance has been well-received, with E! saying that Mos Def "delivers an Emmy-worthy performance."[31]

[edit] Social and political views
By the early 1990s, a brand of socially conscious hip hop that had been popularized by A Tribe Called Quest, KRS-One, and many others had been eclipsed in popularity by gangsta rap. Mos Def, as well as Talib Kweli, Common, Little Brother, Quannum Projects and others helped socially aware rap music experience something of a comeback in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Mos Def's collaboration with Talib Kweli, Black Star, was released during the aftermath of the deaths of 2Pac and The Notorious B.I.G. and focused on violence and deceit in hip-hop, in collaboration with other acts that did the same. His music has also made reference to his Islamic faith, and his contention that black artists receive little credit for their role in the birth of rock and roll.
On Mos Def's 2004 album The New Danger, he took his penchant for experimentation to a new level. Most of the songs were more hip-hop flavored stylings of blues and rock, with fewer raps thrown in. This threw off fans who were expecting another full-blown rap album. The New Danger also featured the controversial song, "The Rape Over," a parody of Jay-Z's The Blueprint hit "Takeover". His label made him take the song off releases of the album, citing clearance issues with Jay-Z and The Doors, a band which the song samples. The song has garnered controversy over its veiled reference to Israeli American record executive Lyor Cohen (the "tall Israeli" who then was head of the The Island Def Jam Music Group).
Mos Def and Immortal Technique released a similarly controversial song, "Bin Laden" in 2004, which blamed the Reagan Doctrine and President George W. Bush for the September 11, 2001 attacks. A club remix song, featuring Eminem, was released the following year, in 2005.
In September 2005, Mos Def released the single "Katrina Clap," renamed "Dollar Day" for True Magic, (utilizing the instrumental for New Orleans rappers UTP's "Nolia Clap"). The song is a criticism of the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. On the night of the MTV Video Music Awards, Mos Def pulled up in front of Radio City Music Hall on a flatbed truck and began performing the "Katrina Clap" single in front of a crowd that quickly gathered around him. He was subsequently arrested despite having a public performance permit in his possession.[32]
On September 7, 2007, Mos Def appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher where he spoke about racism against African Americans, citing the government response to Hurricane Katrina, the Jena Six and the murder conviction of Mumia Abu-Jamal. Mos Def also displayed his deep skepticism, mentioning that Al-Qaeda was not responsible for 9/11, that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax, and that Al-Qaeda is not responsible for as much terrorism as they are portrayed to be.[33] He appeared on Real Time again on March 24, 2009, and spoke about the risk of nuclear weapons. He said that he was unaware of the political aims of the Taliban or Al Qaeda and displayed lack of awareness that Afghanistan was at one time under Taliban control during a combative "Overtime" segment. Mof Def said that he did not listen to any of Bin Laden's messages because he did not trust the translations. The segment has been a hot topic on the HBO forums since its broadcast.

[edit] Personal life
In 1996, he married Maria Yepes. After having two girls, Chandani and Jauhara Smith, he filed for divorce in 2005.[34] The divorce became final in 2006. In connection with his divorce from Yepes, law firm Blank Rome filed suit seeking more than $60,000 in unpaid legal bills.[35]
Mos Def also has three other children with other women.[36]
Mos Def's second marriage was to Alana Wyatt of Toronto, Canada. The two married after knowing one another for only four days. As of April 2008 she has started to publicly reveal aspects of their courtship, marriage, and subsequent separation. A book entitled Breaking Through the Silence has been released exposing such details.[37]
He has recently taken up skateboarding which he learned from his son Elijah Cole and said he's looking to host a skateboarding event in the United Arab Emirates.[4]
In October, 2006 Mos Def appeared on 4Real, a documentary television series.[38] Appearing in the episode "City of God," he and the 4Real crew traveled to City of God, a slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to meet Brazilian MC MV Bill and discover the crime and social problems of the community.[39]
