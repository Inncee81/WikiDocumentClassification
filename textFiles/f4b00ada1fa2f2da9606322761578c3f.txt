From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
This is a list of fairy tales, the dates of their earliest known printed version, the author and, if known, the collection of tales in which it was published. It should be noted, however, that not all stories listed below would be categorized as fairy tales by a strict definition of the term, but rather have entered popular culture as such. As to what exactly constitutes a true fairy tale is subject to discussion, as the line between fable, folktale, fairy tale, or myth is often vague.
While the Children's and old wives Tales by the Grimm Brothers is in essence an assortment of collected folktales, the fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen are original works by the author himself.
Generally speaking, the authors listed below were either those who first wrote the fairy tale in question down or popularized it. Some tales listed as Perrault's were in fact adapted from earlier Italian versions by Giambattista Basile, but in turn, some tales published by the Grimm Brothers were originally Perrault's stories.
The regions listed are not the place of origin of the tale -- a subject on which no firm determination can be made for any fairy tale -- but the place where an oral tale was collected, or a literary tale written down.
