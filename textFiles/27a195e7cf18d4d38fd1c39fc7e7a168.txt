[edit] Genesis
Barber's "Adagio for Strings" originated as the second movement in his String Quartet No. 1, Op. 11, composed in 1936. In the original it follows a violently contrasting first movement, and is succeeded by a brief reprise of this music.
In January 1938 Barber sent the piece to Arturo Toscanini. The conductor returned the score without comment, and Barber was annoyed and avoided the conductor. Subsequently Toscanini sent word through a friend that he was planning to perform the piece and had returned it simply because he had already memorized it.[1] It was reported that Toscanini did not look at the music again until the day before the premiere. [2] The work was given its first performance in a radio broadcast by Arturo Toscanini with the NBC Symphony Orchestra on November 5, 1938 in New York.
The composer also transcribed the piece in 1967 for eight-part choir, as a setting of the Agnus Dei ("Lamb of God").

Adagio for Strings

The piece uses an arch form, employing and then inverting, expanding, and varying a stepwise ascending melody. It is in the key of B-flat minor and is in 4/2 time.
The long, flowing melodic line moves freely between the voices in the string choir; for example, the first section of the Adagio begins with the principal melodic cell played by first violins, but ends with its restatement by violas, transposed down a fifth. Violas continue with a variation on the melodic cell in the second section; the basses are silent for this and the next section. The expansive middle section begins with cellos playing the principal melodic cell in mezzo-soprano range; as the section builds, the string choir moves up the scale to their highest registers, culminating in a fortissimo-forte climax followed by sudden silence. A brief series of mournful chords serve as a coda to this portion of the piece, and reintroduces the bass section. The last section is a restatement of the original theme, with an inversion of the second piece of the melodic cell, played by first violins and violas in unison; the piece ends with first violins slowly restating the first five notes of the melody in alto register, holding the last note over a brief silence and a fading accompaniment.

[edit] Popularity and influence
The recording of the 1938 world premiere, with Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Orchestra, was selected in 2005 for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry at the United States Library of Congress.[3]
The piece was played at the funeral of Prince Rainier of Monaco.[citation needed] Contrary to popular belief, it was not played at the funeral of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but was broadcast over the radio at the announcement of his death.[citation needed] It was performed in 2001 at a ceremony at the World Trade Center to commemorate the victims of the September 11 attacks.[citation needed]
In 2004, listeners of the BBC's Today program voted Adagio the "saddest classical" work ever, ahead of "Dido's Lament" from Dido and Æneas by Henry Purcell, the "Adagietto" from Gustav Mahler's 5th symphony, Metamorphosen by Richard Strauss and Gloomy Sunday as sung by Billie Holiday.[4]
Adagio for Strings may be heard on many film and TV soundtracks.[5] Among these is Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning film Platoon, David Lynch's 1980 Oscar-nominated film The Elephant Man, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Oscar-nominated 2001 film Amélie.
The Agnus Dei arrangement of Adagio for Strings by Santa Barbara's Quire of Voyces has appeared prominently in Relic Entertainment's first computer game Homeworld.
A recorded performance by the London Symphony Orchestra was, for a time, the highest selling classical piece on iTunes.[6]
Several modern artists have arranged the work for the Electronic dance music genre, such as William Orbit, Ferry Corsten, Tiësto, Brennan Heart, and Chicago Zone.
