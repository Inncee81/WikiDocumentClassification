[edit] Early life
From 1958 to 1973, Mortenson grew up on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania.[1] His father, Irvin "Dempsey" Mortenson, was the missionary [1] and founder/development director of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, Tanzania's first teaching hospital.[1] His mother, Dr. Jerene Mortenson, founded the International School Moshi.
Mortenson served in the U.S. Army in Germany from 1975 to 1977 as a medic, and received the Commendation Medal. He attended Concordia College, Moorhead, from 1977 to 1979,[2] and later graduated from the University of South Dakota at Vermillion, South Dakota, in 1983 with an Associate Degree in Nursing and a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry.[3]

[edit] Transition to humanitarianism
In July 1992, Mortenson's young sister, Christa Mortenson, died from a life-long struggle with severe epilepsy on the morning she had planned to visit the cornfield in Dyersville, Iowa, where the baseball movie Field of Dreams was filmed.
In 1993, to honor his deceased sister's memory, Mortenson went to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain, in the Karakoram range of northern Pakistan. After more than 70 days on the mountain, Mortenson and three other climbers completed a life-saving rescue of a fifth climber that took more than 75 hours. The time and energy devoted to this rescue prevented him from attempting to reach the summit. After the rescue, he began his descent of the mountain and became weak and exhausted. Mortenson set out with one local Balti porter to the nearest city, but he took a wrong turn along the way and ended up in Korphe, a small village, where Mortenson was cared for by the villagers while he recovered. [4]
To pay the remote community back for their compassion, Mortenson said he would build a school for the village. After a frustrating time trying to raise money, Mortenson convinced Jean Hoerni, a Silicon Valley pioneer, to found the Central Asia Institute. The mission of CAI -- a non-profit organization -- is to promote education and literacy, especially for girls, in remote mountain regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hoerni named Mortenson as CAI's first Executive Director.
In the process of building schools, Mortenson has survived an eight-day armed 1996 kidnapping in the tribal areas of Waziristan, in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province; escaped a 2003 firefight between Afghan opium warlords; endured two fatwās by angry Islamic clerics for educating girls; and received hate mail and threats from fellow Americans for helping educate Muslim children.
Mortenson believes that education and literacy for girls globally is the most important investment all countries can make to create stability, bring socio-economic reform, decrease infant mortality, decrease the population explosion, and improve health, hygiene, and sanitation standards globally.[5] Mortenson believes that 'fighting terrorism' only perpetuates a cycle of violence, and that there should be a global priority to 'promote peace' through education and literacy, with an emphasis on girls' education. "You can drop bombs, hand out condoms, build roads or put in electricity, but unless the girls are educated, a society won't change", is an often quoted statement made by Mortenson. Because of community 'buy-in', which involves getting villages to donate free land, subsidized or free labor ('sweat equity'), free wood and resources, the schools have local support and have been able to avert retribution by the Taliban or other groups opposed to girls' education. [6]
Mortenson and David Oliver Relin are co-authors of the New York Times best selling book Three Cups of Tea. [7] USA TODAY reported on January 2nd, 2009, that Mortenson has established over 78 schools which help educate over 28,000 students, including 18,000 females. [2] Pennies for Peace is a program Mortenson launched to involve American school-children in fund-raising efforts for the schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan. [8]
The Government of Pakistan announced on its Independence Day of August 14th, 2008, that Mortenson will receive Pakistan’s highest civilian award, the Sitara-e-Pakistan (The Star of Pakistan), in a Islamabad civil ceremony during Pakistan Day on March 23rd, 2009. According to Article 259(2) of Pakistan's Constitution, the President of Pakistan -- acting on behalf of the State -- confers civil awards in recognition of services rendered, gallantry or distinction.
In August 2008, Mortenson met with then-President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, and discussed the book Three Cups of Tea over tea, [9] and in March 2009, Mortenson met with new President Asif Zardari for a cup of tea, upon receiving the Sitara-e-Pakistan award. [10].

[edit] Family
Mortenson's home is in Montana. His ancestors migrated via ship and ox-cart carriages from the Lofoten Islands, north of the Arctic circle in Norway, and homesteaded near Starbuck, Minnesota, in the U.S. in the 1860s. Mortenson's father, Dempsey, died from cancer in 1981. His mother, Jerene, is a retired elementary school principal, and manages the ice cream soda fountain at Lake Lodge in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Mortenson has two surviving sisters, Sonja Rauen and Kari Theisen, and is married to Dr. Tara Bishop, a clinical psychologist, with whom he has two children. [11] Tara Bishop is the daughter of the famed Dr. Barry Chapman Bishop, (1932–1994), a geographer and glaciologist. Dr. Bishop was a National Geographic Society editor, photographer of the historic 1963 American Mount Everest expedition, and chairman of the NGS Research & Exploration Committee.
