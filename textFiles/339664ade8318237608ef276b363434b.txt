FreeMind is a free mind mapping application written in Java. FreeMind is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It provides extensive export capabilities. It runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux and MacOS X via the Java Runtime Environment.[1] [2][unreliable source?] [3][unreliable source?]
As with other mind mapping software packages, FreeMind allows the user to edit a hierarchical set of ideas around a central concept. The non-linear approach assists in brainstorming new outlines and projects as ideas are added around the mind map.[1] As a Java application, FreeMind is portable across multiple platforms and retains its same user interface, causing some amount of variation from the common interface in each platform. Mac users may notice the most difference from their traditional user interface. Though a MacWorld reviewer says the software's features should still appeal to the segment of users who accept function over form.[4]
FreeMind was a nominee for Best Project in SourceForge.net's Community Choice Awards for 2008, which featured Open Source software projects.[5]

[edit] Features
FreeMind's most significant features are as follows:[3][6]

Folding branches
Save files as XML
Export hypertext to HTML and XHTML
Export document to PDF and OpenDocument
Exports image to PNG, JPEG and SVG
Icons on nodes
Clouds around branches
Graphical links connecting nodes
Search restricted to single branches
Web and file hyperlinks from nodes

Transform maps using XSLT

FreeMind uses the Swing GUI toolkit for Java.
FreeMind developers or developers of other projects have made plugins for various wiki and content management system software so that Freemind files can be viewed and in some cases created via the web interface. These systems include Confluence, Drupal, JSPWiki, MediaWiki, MoinMoin, Moodle, TikiWiki, Trac, TWiki and WikkaWiki.
