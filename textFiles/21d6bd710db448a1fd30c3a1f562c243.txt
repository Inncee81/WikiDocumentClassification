Systems Thinking is any process of estimating or inferring how local policies, actions, or changes influences the state of the neighboring universe. It is an approach to problem solving that views "problems" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to present outcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of the undesired issue or problem.[1] Systems thinking is a framework that is based on the belief that the component parts of a system can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. The only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the part in relation to the whole.[2] Standing in contrast to Descartes's scientific reductionism and philosophical analysis, it proposes to view systems in a holistic manner. Consistent with systems philosophy, systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system.
Systems thinking attempts to illustrate that events are separated by distance and time and that small catalytic events can cause large changes in complex systems. Acknowledging that an improvement in one area of a system can adversely affect another area of the system, it promotes organizational communication at all levels in order to avoid the silo effect. Systems thinking techniques may be used to study any kind of system — natural, scientific, engineered, human, or conceptual.

[edit] The concept of a system
Both systems thinkers and futurists consider that:

a "system" is a dynamic and complex whole, interacting as a structured functional unit;
energy, material and information flow among the different elements that compose the system;
a system is a community situated within an environment;
energy, material and information flow from and to the surrounding environment via semi-permeable membranes or boundaries;
systems are often composed of entities seeking equilibrium but can exhibit oscillating, chaotic, or exponential behavior.

A holistic system is any set (group) of interdependent or temporally interacting parts. Parts are generally systems themselves and are composed of other parts, just as systems are generally parts or holons of other systems.
Systems and the application of systems thinking has been grouped into three categories based on the techniques used to tackle a system:

Hard systems — involving simulations, often using computers and the techniques of operations research. Useful for problems that can justifiably be quantified. However it cannot easily take into account unquantifiable variables (opinions, culture, politics, etc), and may treat people as being passive, rather than having complex motivations.
Soft systems — For systems that cannot easily be quantified, especially those involving people holding multiple and conflicting frames of reference. Useful for understanding motivations, viewpoints, and interactions and addressing qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions of problem situations. Soft systems are a field that utilizes foundation methodological work developed by Peter Checkland, Brian Wilson and their colleagues at Lancaster University. Morphological analysis is a complementary method for structuring and analysing non-quantifiable problem complexes.
Evolutionary systems — Béla H. Bánáthy developed a methodology that is applicable to the design of complex social systems. This technique integrates critical systems inquiry with soft systems methodologies. Evolutionary systems, similar to dynamic systems are understood as open, complex systems, but with the capacity to evolve over time. Bánáthy uniquely integrated the interdisciplinary perspectives of systems research (including chaos, complexity, cybernetics), cultural anthropology, evolutionary theory, and others.


[edit] The systems approach
The Systems thinking approach incorporates several tenets:[3]

Interdependence of objects and their attributes - independent elements can never constitute a system
Holism - emergent properties not possible to detect by analysis should be possible to define by a holistic approach
Goal seeking - systemic interaction must result in some goal or final state
Inputs and Outputs - in a closed system inputs are determined once and constant; in an open system additional inputs are admitted from the environment
Transformation of inputs into outputs - this is the process by which the goals are obtained
Entropy - the amount of disorder or randomness present in any system
Regulation - a method of feedback is necessary for the system to operate predictably
Hierarchy - complex wholes are made up of smaller subsystems
Differentiation - specialized units perform specialized functions
Equifinality - alternative ways of attaining the same objectives (convergence)
Multifinality - attaining alternative objectives from the same inputs (divergence)

Some examples:

Rather than trying to improve the braking system on a car by looking in great detail at the material composition of the brake pads (reductionist), the boundary of the braking system may be extended to include the interactions between the:




brake disks or drums
brake pedal sensors
hydraulics
driver reaction time
tires
road conditions
weather conditions
time of day




Using the tenet of "Multifinality", a supermarket could be considered to be:




a "profit making system" from the perspective of management and owners
a "distribution system" from the perspective of the suppliers
an "employment system" from the perspective of employees
a "materials supply system" from the perspective of customers
an "entertainment system" from the perspective of loiterers
a "social system" from the perspective of local residents
a "dating system" from the perspective of single customers



As a result of such thinking, new insights may be gained into how the supermarket works, why it has problems, how it can be improved or how changes made to one component of the system may impact the other components.

[edit] Applications
Systems thinking is increasingly being used to tackle a wide variety of subjects in fields such as computing, engineering, epidemiology, information science, health, manufacture, management, and the environment.
Some examples:

Organizational architecture
Job design
Team Population and Work Unit Design
Linear and Complex Process Design
Supply Chain Design
Business continuity planning with FMEA protocol
Critical Infrastructure Protection via FBI Infragard
Delphi method — developed by RAND for USAF
Futures studies — Thought leadership mentoring
Leadership development
Oceanography — forecasting complex systems behavior
Permaculture
Quality function deployment (QFD)
Quality management — Hoshin planning methods
Quality storyboard — StoryTech framework (LeapfrogU-EE)
Software quality
Program management
Project management
Six Thinking Hats
