For other uses, see Wild Style (disambiguation).
Wild Style was the first hip hop motion picture. Released independently in 1982 by First Run Features and later re-released for home video by Rhino Home Video, the movie featured actors like Fab Five Freddy, Lee Quinones, the Rock Steady Crew, The Cold Crush Brothers, Patti Astor, Sandra Fabara and Grandmaster Flash. The protagonist is the legendary New York graffiti artist "Lee" George Quinones as "Zoro". The "Wild Style" logo originally designed by TRACY168 on the film's cover was copied and applied by scenic painters Zephyr, Revolt and Sharp.[1]
The film itself is unique in that the actors play roles that were designed to show exactly how they were in real life. The movie was given a loose storyline as a means of commercializing it, but the story is not the reason it is so highly regarded. It's the culmination of legendary hip hop icons being filmed in their emergence along with a profound documentation of a new budding sub-culture that draws people to this film.

[edit] Synopsis
The film depicts several prominent figures from the early hip hop culture, engaging in activities such as MCing, turntablism, graffiti and breakdancing. The original WiLD STYLE was an artist named TRACY168. Quote TRACY168, "It's not just an artform, it's my way of life"[citation needed].

[edit] Impact
The film has received a large cult following over the years after its initial release. Highly regarded hip-hop albums such as Illmatic by Nas, Midnight Marauders by A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sunday by Cypress Hill, Resurrection by Common, Big Shots by Charizma, Doomsday by MF Doom, Check Your Head by Beastie Boys and Quality Control by Jurassic 5 have featured samples from Wildstyle. Significantly, the MTA allowed director Charlie Ahearn to film in the actual train yards in New York City. In 2007, the VH1 Hip Hop Honors paid tribute to Wild Style in recognition of its influence upon the culture.
