[edit] Standards
The Dokeos code is written in PHP, using MySQL as database backend. It supports SCORM 1.2 import and export. User data can be imported into the system using CSV or XML files. Dokeos can add user info and authenticate through LDAP. For the 1.6 release, the Dokeos developer team has put efforts into complying with W3C xhtml and CSS standards. In 1.8.x, JavaScript is required (light integration into the visual layer), and using SCORM requires the use of frames in the learning path module.

[edit] Development
The development of Dokeos is an international project to which several universities, schools, and other organisations and individuals contribute. The Dokeos development methodology takes elements from extreme programming, usability theory, and collaborative open source development methodology, like the ideas in the Cathedral and the Bazaar.
Specifically, Dokeos is very open. There is a forum, used by Dokeos users for discussion and feedback. The agenda and minutes of all developer meetings are published, and a 'roadmap' is also public. All designs and developer documentation are publicly available on the Dokeos wiki. Everyone who registers can contribute. There are currently 21 developers with CVS write access, other people contribute by sending code through email, forum or wiki.

[edit] Adoption of Dokeos

More than 30 languages are supported (with varying quality levels)[2]
The largest known Dokeos installation (Ghent University) currently has 28,696 active users and 3,604 active courses (the courses are not created in batch but the teachers decide when and if they create their course). When the results of the exams were released to the students Minerva peaked at 7,197 simultaneous users (28 feb 2006)[citation needed]. More information: http://icto.ugent.be or http://minerva.ugent.be).
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel has adopted Dokeos under the name PointCarré (referring to the mathematician and philosopher Henri Poincaré), switching from a Blackboard platform to Dokeos in 2005, together with its associated institution Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel.[citation needed]
Some companies like Arcelor Mittal, Lutosa or TNG run Dokeos
Dokeos is widely used in public administrations : Belgian ministries of Health, Defence, Internal Affairs, Unemployed
