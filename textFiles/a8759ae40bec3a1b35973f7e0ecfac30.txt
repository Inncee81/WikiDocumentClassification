Brewster Kahle speaking 20 November 2002


Brewster Kahle (pronounced /ˈkeɪl/ 'kale') (born 1960)[1] is a U.S. internet entrepreneur, activist and digital librarian. Kahle graduated from MIT in 1982 with a BS degree in Computer Science & Engineering where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity. The emphasis of his studies was artificial intelligence; he studied under Marvin Minsky and W. Daniel Hillis.
He was an early member of the Thinking Machines team, where he invented the WAIS system. He later started WAIS, Inc. (sold to AOL), the nonprofit Internet Archive, and the related for-profit Alexa Internet (sold to Amazon.com). He continues as Director of the Internet Archive as of 2007[update]. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a key supporter of the Open Content Alliance. His stated goal is "Universal Access to all Knowledge".
In 2005, Kahle was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. [1]
Kahle and his wife Mary Austin created the Kahle/Austin Foundation, a US$45 million trust which in 2003 gave US$1,787,175 to Internet Archive.
In his TED Talk on building free digital library[2], Kahle describes his vision of free digital library, which contains books, free music concerts, TV programs, snapshot of internet etc.
