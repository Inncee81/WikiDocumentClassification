ImageJ is a public domain, Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health.[1] ImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins and recordable macros.[2] Custom acquisition, analysis and processing plugins can be developed using ImageJ's built-in editor and a Java compiler. User-written plugins make it possible to solve many image processing and analysis problems, from three-dimensional live-cell imaging,[3] to radiological image processing,[4] multiple imaging system data comparisons[5] to automated hematology systems.[6] ImageJ's plugin architecture and built in development environment has made it a popular platform for teaching image processing.[7][8]
ImageJ can be run as an online applet, a downloadable application, or on any computer with a Java 1.4 or later virtual machine. Downloadable distributions are available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Mac OS X, Linux, and the Sharp Zaurus PDA. The source code for ImageJ is freely available - an important issue when working with scientific images.[9]
The project developer, Wayne Rasband, is at the Research Services Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health.

[edit] Specifications
ImageJ can display, edit, analyze, process, save, and print 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit images. It can read many image formats including TIFF, PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, FITS, as well as raw formats. ImageJ supports image stacks, a series of images that share a single window, and it is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations such as image file reading can be performed in parallel with other operations. ImageJ can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections and intensity thresholded objects. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density histograms and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing functions such as logical and arithmetical operations between images, contrast manipulation, convolution, Fourier analysis, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection and median filtering. It does geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation and flips. The program supports any number of images simultaneously, limited only by available memory.

[edit] History
Prior to the release of ImageJ in 1997, a similar freeware image analysis program known as NIH Image had been developed for Macintosh computers running pre-Mac OS X operating systems. A Windows version – ported by Scion Corporation – was also developed. Both versions are still available.[10]
