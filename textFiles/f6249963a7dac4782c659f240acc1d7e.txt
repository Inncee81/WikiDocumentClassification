Xming is an implementation of the X Window System computer software to the Microsoft Windows operating system, including XP, 2003 and Vista. The Xming X Server is based on the X.Org Server, cross-compiled on Linux with the MinGW compiler suite and Pthreads-Win32.
Xming is also available with Mesa 3D support. Xming supports a variety of languages.
Unlike Cygwin/X, Xming does not require Cygwin runtime libraries.
Xming may be used with implementations of Secure Shell (SSH) to securely forward X11 sessions from other computers. It supports PuTTY and ssh.exe, and comes with a version of PuTTY's plink.exe.
