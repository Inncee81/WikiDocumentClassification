This article is about the geometrical figure.  For the Indian highway project, see Golden Quadrilateral.
A golden rectangle is a rectangle whose side lengths are in the golden ratio, 1:  (one-to-phi), that is,  or approximately 1:1.618.
A distinctive feature of this shape is that when a square section is removed, the remainder is another golden rectangle; that is, with the same proportions as the first. Square removal can be repeated infinitely, in which case corresponding corners of the squares form an infinite sequence of points on the golden spiral, the unique logarithmic spiral with this property.
According to astrophysicist and math popularizer Mario Livio, since the publication of Luca Pacioli's Divina Proportione in 1509,[1] when "with Pacioli's book, the Golden Ratio started to become available to artists in theoretical treatises that were not overly mathematical, that they could actually use,"[2] many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the form of the golden rectangle, which has been considered aesthetically pleasing. The proportions of the golden rectangle have been observed in works predating Pacioli's publication.[3]

[edit] Construction




A method to construct a golden rectangle. The square is outlined in red. The resulting dimensions are in the ratio 1:, the golden ratio.


A golden rectangle can be constructed with only straightedge and compass by this technique:

Construct a simple square
Draw a line from the midpoint of one side of the square to an opposite corner
Use that line as the radius to draw an arc that defines the height of the rectangle
Complete the golden rectangle


[edit] Applications

Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in Garches features a rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure that are closely approximate to golden rectangles.[4]
Jan Tschichold describes the use of the golden rectangle in medieval book designs
