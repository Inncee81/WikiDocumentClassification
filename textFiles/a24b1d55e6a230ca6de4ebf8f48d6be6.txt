Great Depression: United States GDP annual pattern and long-term trend, 1920–40, in billions of constant dollars[1]


This is a list of recessions that have affected the United States. Though economists define a recession as two quarters of negative GDP growth, the beginning and ending dates of U.S. recessions are officially determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).[2] The NBER defines a recession as, "...a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales."[3] From 1945-2007 the NBER has identified 11 recessions;[4] their average duration was 10 months (peak to trough).[5]
Most of the recessions listed here have affected economies on a worldwide scale; some of them are the Great Depression, the late 1980s recession, and the early 2000s recession. Recessions in one country are often grouped together with recessions in other countries that are related, and they commonly share a focal point as the cause of the recession.[6]
Note that before detailed economic statistics began to be gathered in the nineteenth century, it was difficult to tell when recessions occurred.[7] In spite of this, it is possible to estimate when economic recessions began because they were typically caused by external actions on the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather.[8]

Panic of 1797
1797–1800
&0000000000000003.0000003 years
–
The effects of the deflation of the Bank of England crossed the Atlantic Ocean to North America and disrupted commercial and real estate markets in the United States and the Caribbean. Britain's economy was greatly affected by developing disflationary repercussions because it was fighting France in the French Revolutionary Wars at the time.
[9] [5]


Depression of 1807
1807–1814
&0000000000000007.0000007 years
&0000000000000010.00000010 years
The Embargo Act of 1807 was passed by the United States Congress under President Thomas Jefferson. It devastated shipping-related industries. The Federalists fought the embargo and allowed smuggling to take place in New England.
[10][11][5]


Panic of 1819
1819–1824
&0000000000000005.0000005 years
&0000000000000012.00000012 years
The first major financial crisis in the United States featured widespread foreclosures, bank failures, unemployment, and a slump in agriculture and manufacturing. It also marked the end of the economic expansion that followed the War of 1812.
[12][13][5]


Panic of 1837
1837–1843
&0000000000000006.0000006 years
&0000000000000018.00000018 years
A sharp downturn in the American economy was caused by bank failures and lack of confidence in the paper currency. Speculation markets were greatly affected when American banks stopped payment in specie (gold and silver coinage).
[14][5]


Panic of 1857
1857–1860
&0000000000000003.0000003 years
&0000000000000020.00000020 years
Failure of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company burst a European speculative bubble in United States railroads and caused a loss of confidence in American banks. Over 5,000 businesses failed within the first year of the Panic, and unemployment was accompanied by protest meetings in urban areas.
[15][5]


Panic of 1873
1873–1879
&0000000000000006.0000006 years
&0000000000000016.00000016 years
Economic problems in Europe prompted the failure of the Jay Cooke & Company, the largest bank in the United States, which burst the post-Civil War speculative bubble. The Coinage Act of 1873 also contributed by immediately depressing the price of silver, which hurt North American mining interests.
[16][5]


Long Depression
1873–1896
&0000000000000023.00000023 years
–
The collapse of the Vienna Stock Exchange caused a depression that spread throughout the world. It is important to note that during this period, the global industrial production greatly increased. In the United States, for example, industrial output increased fourfold.
[17][5]


Panic of 1893
1893–1896
&0000000000000003.0000003 years
&0000000000000020.00000020 years
Failure of the United States Reading Railroad and withdrawal of European investment led to a stock market and banking collapse. This Panic was also precipitated in part by a run on the gold supply.
[18][5]


Panic of 1907
1907–1908
&0000000000000001.0000001 year
&0000000000000014.00000014 years
A run on Knickerbocker Trust Company deposits on October 22, 1907, set events in motion that would lead to a severe monetary contraction.
[19][5]


Post-World War I recession
1918–1921
&0000000000000003.0000003 years
&0000000000000011.00000011 years
Severe hyperinflation in Europe took place over production in North America. It was a brief but very sharp recession and was caused by the end of wartime production, along with an influx of labor from returning troops. This in turn caused high unemployment.
[20][5]


Great Depression
1929–1939
&0000000000000010.00000010 years
&0000000000000011.00000011 years
Stock markets crashed worldwide, and a banking collapse took place in the United States. This sparked a global downturn, including a second severe recession. (The Recession of 1937 is only considered minor when compared to the Great Depression, but is otherwise among the worst recessions of the 20th century).
[21][5]


Recession of 1953
1953–1954
&0000000000000001.0000001 year
&0000000000000024.00000024 years
After a post-Korean War inflationary period, more funds were transferred into national security. The Federal Reserve changed monetary policy to be more restrictive in 1952 due to fears of further inflation.
[22][23][5]


Recession of 1957
1957–1958
&0000000000000001.0000001 year
&0000000000000004.0000004 years
Monetary policy was tightened during the two years preceding 1957, followed by an easing of policy at the end of 1957. The budget balance resulted in a change in budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 1957 to a budget deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 1958, and then to 2.6% of GDP in 1959.
[24][5]


Recession of 1960-1
1960–1961
&0000000000000001.0000001 year
&0000000000000003.0000003 years
After President Kennedy's 30 January 1961 call for increased government spending to improve the Gross National Product and to reduce unemployment, the 1960-61 recession ended in February.[25]


1973 oil crisis
1973–1974 stock market crash

1973–1975
&0000000000000002.0000002 years
&0000000000000013.00000013 years
A quadrupling of oil prices by OPEC coupled with high government spending due to the Vietnam War led to stagflation in the United States.
[26][5]


Early 1980s recession
1980–1982
&0000000000000002.0000002 years
&0000000000000007.0000007 years
The Iranian Revolution sharply increased the price of oil around the world in 1979, causing the 1979 energy crisis. This was caused by the new regime in power in Iran, which exported oil at inconsistent intervals and at a lower volume, forcing prices to go up. Tight monetary policy in the United States to control inflation led to another recession. The changes were made largely because of inflation that was carried over from the previous decade due to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis.
[27][28][5]


Early 1990s recession
1990–1991
&0000000000000001.0000001 year
&0000000000000010.00000010 years
Industrial production and manufacturing-trade sales increased in early 1991.
[29][5]


Early 2000s recession
Mar-Nov 2001
&0000000000000006.0000006 months
&0000000000000011.00000011 years
The collapse of the dot-com bubble, the September 11th attacks, and accounting scandals contributed to a relatively mild contraction in the North American economy.
[30][5]


Late 2000s recession
Dec 2007-current
ongoing
&0000000000000006.0000006 years
The collapse of the housing market led to bank collapses in the US and Europe, causing the amount of available credit to be sharply curtailed, resulting in a massive liquidity crisis. In addition, high oil prices, stock markets crashed worldwide, and a banking collapse took place in the United States.
