Vincenzo Camuccini, Mort de César, 1798.


The Ides of March (Latin: Idus Martias) is the name of the date March 15 in the Roman calendar. The term ides was used for the 15th day of the months of March, May, July, and October.[1] The Ides of March was a festive Day dedicated to the god Mars and a military parade was usually held. In modern times, the term Ides of March is best known as the date that Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. In William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, Caesar is warned to "beware the Ides of March."[2]

[edit] Etymology
The term idūs (ides) originally referred to the day of the full moon. The Romans considered this an auspicious day in their calendar. The word ides comes from Latin, meaning "half division" (of a month) but is probably of non-Indo-European origin.[3]
