Xandros is both the name of a line of operating systems and Xandros Corporation, the company which creates them. Xandros Desktop is a Linux distribution. The name Xandros is derived from the X Window System and the Greek island of Andros.[1] Founded in May 2001 by Linux Global Partners,[2] the company is headquartered in New York City.
Their distributions are based on Corel Linux, a Debian-based distribution which was acquired along with the development team behind the product from Corel Corporation in August 2001 after Corel decided to leave the Linux distribution market.[3] Xandros is also a founding member of the Desktop Linux Consortium and the Interop Vendor Alliance[citation needed].
In July 2007, Xandros bought Scalix, a Linux-based email and collaboration product, based on HP OpenMail.[4][5] In July 2008, Xandros acquired Linspire.

[edit] Products
Xandros makes products for both the consumer and business markets. While the distributions include many packages licensed as free software and open-source, Xandros is criticized for inclusion of proprietary software developed in-house by the Xandros Corporation.[6]

[edit] Commercial editions

[edit] Xandros Desktop Home Edition
This edition comes with a 30-day trial of Crossover Office. It also includes an "Applications CD" which includes extra programs which can be installed via Xandros Networks. As opposed to Home Edition Premium, the Home Edition does not include the photo manager, music manager, security suite, wireless profiles, or the ability to write to NTFS partitions.

[edit] Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium
This edition comes with a full version of Crossover Office Standard Edition, and a second CD (the "Applications CD") which comes with extra applications which can be installed via Xandros Networks. Despite its name, Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium does not include a Xandros Networks Premium Membership.
Xandros Corporation offers a 30-day trial version of Xandros Home Edition Premium as a free download for evaluation purposes.

[edit] Xandros Desktop Professional
Formerly known as Xandros Desktop Business Edition, this edition is basically the same as Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium, but it includes the ability to authenticate to Windows PDC and Active Directory Domains, use PPTP VPN to connect remotely to the office, and use broadband wireless connectivity with 3G, GSM and UMTS support. Xandros Desktop Professional was officially released on 28 November 2006.
As with Home Edition Premium, Xandros Corporation also offers a 30-day trial version of Xandros Professional.

[edit] Product activation
Xandros 4.0 was criticized for the addition of a product activation feature similar to the one found in Windows XP. However, unlike the Windows XP product activation code, which is required in order to use Windows XP after 30 days, the Xandros product activation code was used to authorize a copy of Xandros to download programs and updates from Xandros Networks, Xandros' proprietary APT-based download tool similar to Linspire's CNR. When the OS is first installed, Xandros Networks is disabled; it has to be enabled by using the product activation code. Users must contact Xandros Support for further activation codes after they pass a 10 activation limit. After much criticism over the product activation feature, Xandros released the Service Pack 1 update to Xandros 4.0 which did away with it; Version 4.1 of Xandros, which has the Service Pack 1 update integrated into the OS, does not have product activation.[7]

[edit] Server systems
Xandros Desktop Management Server (xDMS) is available. It easily sets up repositories as it deploys customized Xandros Desktop configurations across a large organization.[citation needed]
Xandros Server is designed to run on servers. It was officially launched at the 2006 LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in Toronto, on 25 April 2006, and officially released for purchase at the Xandros website on 1 May 2006, at a MSRP of USD 450. Xandros Server 2.0 has been released in May 2007.[8]

[edit] Discontinued editions
Xandros Open Circulation Edition (OCE) was a freely redistributable edition for non-commercial use, with a limited set of additional software. Soon after the 4.0 version was released as a DVD shrinkwrapped with Linux magazines, the torrent was pulled from Xandros' servers and all references to OCE removed from the Xandros website without explanation. Previous versions of Xandros OCE were generally released about 4 months after the release of the commercial versions.[9]
However, despite not being available officially, a link to download Xandros 4.1 OCE was later posted within Xandros' User Support forums.[10]
Xandros Desktop OS Standard Edition was basically the same as the Open Circulation Edition, but it included full-speed CD/DVD burning. This product has been replaced by Home Edition.
Xandros Desktop OS Deluxe Edition included an "applications CD" which included extra programs which could be installed via Xandros Networks. This product has been replaced by Home Edition Premium.
Xandros Desktop OS Surfside Edition was basically the same as Xandros Desktop OS Standard Edition, however the Surfside Edition also included a Plantronics USB headset and 120 minutes of SkypeOut service.

[edit] Look and feel

The Xandros GUI uses a modified version of KDE, which includes replacing Konqueror with its own proprietary file manager called Xandros File Manager. It also uses a package manager known as Xandros Networks, which handles installation of software. Installation of Xandros is done by a wizard that asks questions about partitioning and the administrator (root) password.
It is possible to install and use the GNOME and Xfce desktop environments on Xandros.

[edit] Collaboration with Microsoft
See also: Software patents and free software
In June 2007, a "broad collaboration agreement" between Xandros and Microsoft was announced.[11] The agreement included "patent covenants [to not sue] Xandros customers", similar to the agreement that Microsoft reached with Novell. To date, there has been no real evidence that any patent infringement has occurred. Microsoft appears unwilling to specify which patents it alleges to have been infringed. Because this deal was signed after 28 March 2007, Xandros will apparently be unable to distribute software licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License while party to the patent arrangement.[12]

[edit] ASUS Eee PC
The ASUS Eee PC can come with Xandros installed as well as Windows XP. The installed version of Xandros is tab based, built from scratch using Xlib and the Qt3 toolkit. The full desktop version (or "Advanced Mode") may be installed—but not always easily—through a set of administrative command prompts[13]. The full desktop version features a KDE 3 desktop with a few modifications performed by Xandros. This desktop mode also provides access to the Synaptic Package Manager which can be used to update and manage the Eee PC's software.[14][15]
Xandros is porting its Eee PC Linux distribution to 2 ARM processor-based (Freescale i.MX515 & the Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU) platforms for netbooks & other mobile devices.[16]
