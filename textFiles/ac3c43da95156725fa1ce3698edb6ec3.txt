[edit] Sources and inspirations
Greene uses anecdotes from historical figures such as Louis XIV, Talleyrand, Otto von Bismarck, Catherine the Great, Mao Zedong, Haile Selassie and various con artists in order to illustrate real-world application of the 48 rules. Greene's modern courtship theory was inspired by the writings of Baltasar Gracian and Niccolò Machiavelli.[citation needed] Greene also often uses an amoral approach, mimicking Machiavellian language, leaving the reader to weigh the ethical implications of the laws.
