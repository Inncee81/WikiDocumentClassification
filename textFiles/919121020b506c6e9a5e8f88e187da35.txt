Trac is an open source, web-based project management and bug-tracking tool. The program is inspired by CVSTrac, and was originally named svntrac due to its ability to interface with Subversion.[1] It is developed and maintained by Edgewall Software.
Trac is written in the Python programming language. Until mid-2005, it was available under the GNU General Public License; since version 0.9, it has been released under a modified BSD license.[2] Both are free software licenses.

[edit] Features
Trac allows hyperlinking information between a computer bug database, revision control and wiki content. It also serves as a web interface to a version control system like Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and Darcs. Prior to version 0.11 the web front end presentation of Trac was handled by the ClearSilver template system. Starting with 0.11 an in-house template system called Genshi is used, although compatibility with ClearSilver based plugins will remain for several versions.[3]

[edit] Adoption
Trac is reported to have more than 450 major installations worldwide.[4] Among the users of Trac is NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which reports that it uses this tool to manage various deep space and near space projects, and WebKit, the open source browser rendering engine that powers Apple's Safari browser (and also Adobe's AIR among other implementations).
