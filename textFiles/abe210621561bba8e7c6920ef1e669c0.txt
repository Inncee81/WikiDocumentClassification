Art Deco was a popular international art design movement from 1925 until 1939, affecting the decorative arts such as architecture, interior design, and industrial design, as well as the visual arts such as fashion, painting, the graphic arts and film. At the time, this style was seen as elegant, glamorous, functional, and modern.
The movement was, in a sense, an amalgam of many different styles and movements of the early 20th century, including Neoclassical, Constructivism, Cubism, Modernism, Art Nouveau, and Futurism.[1] Its popularity peaked in Europe during the Roaring Twenties[2] and continued strongly in the United States through the 1930s.[3] Although many design movements have political or philosophical roots or intentions, Art Deco was purely decorative.[4]
Art Deco experienced a decline in popularity during the late 30s and early 40s, and soon fell out of public favor. It experienced a resurgence with the popularization of graphic design in the 1980s. Art Deco had a profound influence on many later artistic movements, such as Memphis and Pop art.
Surviving examples may still be seen in many different locations worldwide, in countries as diverse as the United Kingdom, Spain, Cuba, the Philippines, Romania, New Zealand and Brazil. Many classic examples still exist in the form of architecture in many major cities. The Chrysler building, designed by William Van Alen, is a classic example of this, as it is one of the most notable examples of Art Deco architecture today.

[edit] History




"The Musician", oil painting on canvas by Tamara de Lempicka, 1929.


After the Universal Exposition of 1900, various French artists formed an informal collective known as, La Société des artistes décorateurs (the society of the decorator artists).[5] Founders included Hector Guimard, Eugène Grasset, Raoul Lachenal, Paul Follot, Maurice Dufrene, and Emile Decour. These artists heavily influenced the principles of Art Deco as a whole.[6] This society's purpose was to demonstrate French decorative art's leading position and evolution internationally. They organized the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Art) in Paris,[7] which would feature French art and business interests.[8][6] The terms Style Moderne and Art Deco both derive from the exposition's title,[3] though Art Deco was not widely used until popularized by art historian Bevis Hillier's 1968 book Art Deco of the 20s and 30s.[9]
In the summer of 1969, Hillier conceived organizing an exhibition called Art Deco at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts,[10] which took place from July to September 1971. After this event, interest in Art Deco peaked with the publication of his 1971 book The World of Art Deco, a record of the exhibition.[11]

[edit] Sources
The structure of Art Deco is based on mathematical geometric shapes.[12] It was widely considered to be an eclectic form of elegant and stylish modernism, being influenced by a variety of sources. Among them were the so-called "primitive" arts of Africa, Ancient Egypt,[12][13] and Aztec Mexico.[1] It also drew on Machine Age or streamline technology,[14] such as modern aviation, electric lighting, the radio, the ocean liner and the skyscraper for inspiration.[1] It is in streamline modern styles that this technology fully manifests itself and, although it is not antithetical to Art Deco, it is now considered to be a separate architectural style.[15]

Art Deco design influences were expressed in the crystalline and faceted forms of decorative Cubism and Futurism.[16][16] Other popular themes in Art Deco were trapezoidal, zigzagged, geometric, and jumbled shapes,[13][17] which can be seen in many early pieces. Two great examples of these themes and styles are in Detroit, Michigan: the Fisher Building and the Guardian Building.[18]

[edit] Attributes
Art Deco was an opulent style, and its lavishness is attributed to reaction to the forced austerity imposed by World War I. Its rich, festive character fitted it for "modern" contexts, including the Golden Gate Bridge, interiors of cinema theaters (a prime example being the Paramount Theater in Oakland, California) and ocean liners such as the Île de France, the Queen Mary, and Normandie. Art Deco was employed extensively throughout the United States' train stations in the 1930s,[19] designed to reflect the modernity and efficiency of the train. The first Art Deco train station in the United States was the Union Station in Omaha, Nebraska.[20] Art Deco made use of many distinctive styles, but one of the most significant of its features was its dependence upon a range of ornaments and motifs.[1] The style is said to have reflected the tensions in the cultural politics of its day, with eclecticism having been one of its defining features.[1][13] In the words of Scott Fitzgerald, the distinctive style of Art Deco was shaped by 'all the nervous energy stored up and expended in the War'.[1][21] Art Deco has been influenced in part by movements such as Cubism, Russian Constructivism and Italian Futurism,[13] which 'are all evident in Art Deco decorative arts'.[6]

[edit] Materials and design
Art Deco is characterized by use of materials such as aluminium, stainless steel, lacquer and inlaid wood.[12][7][13] Exotic materials such as sharkskin (shagreen), and zebraskin were also in evidence.[7][13][22][17] The bold use of stepped forms and sweeping curves (unlike the sinuous, natural curves of the Art Nouveau),[23][12] chevron patterns, and the sunburst motif are typical of Art Deco. Some of these motifs were ubiquitous — for example, sunburst motifs were used in such varied contexts as ladies' shoes, radiator grilles, the auditorium of the Radio City Music Hall, and the spire of the Chrysler Building.

[edit] Streamline Moderne

A parallel movement called Streamline Moderne, or simply Streamline, followed close behind. Streamline was influenced by the modern aerodynamic designs,[12] including those emerging from advancing technologies in aviation, ballistics, and other fields requiring high velocity. The attractive shapes resulting from scientifically applied aerodynamic principles were enthusiastically adopted within Art Deco, applying streamlining techniques to other useful objects in everyday life, such as the automobile. Although the Chrysler Airflow design of 1933 was commercially unsuccessful, it provided the lead for more conservatively designed pseudo-streamlined vehicles. These "streamlined" forms began to be used in the design of mundane and static objects such as pencil sharpeners and refrigerators.[12]
Art Deco celebrates the Machine Age through explicit use of man-made materials (particularly glass and stainless steel),[12] symmetry,[23] and repetition, modified by Asian influences such as the use of silks and Middle Eastern designs. It was strongly adopted in the United States during the Great Depression for its practicality and simplicity, while still portraying a reminder of better times and the "American Dream".[3]

[edit] Decline and resurgence
Art Deco slowly lost patronage in the West after reaching mass production, when it began to be derided as gaudy and presenting a false image of luxury. Eventually, the style was cut short by the austerities of World War II. Before destruction in World War II, Manila possessed many Art Deco buildings; a legacy of the American colonial past. A resurgence of interest in Art Deco came first in the 1960s,[7][24][13] and then again in the 1980s with the growing interest in graphic design,[7] where its association with film noir and 1930s glamour led to its use in advertisements for jewelry and fashion.[25]

[edit] Surviving examples
Some of the finest surviving examples of Art Deco art and architecture are found in Cuba, especially in Havana. The Bacardi Building is noted for its particular style,[26] which echoes the classic themes of Art Deco. The style is expressed in the architecture of residences, businesses, hotels, and many pieces of decorative art, furniture, and utensils in public buildings, as well as in private homes.[27] Another country with many examples of rich Art Deco architecture is Brazil, specially in Goiânia and cities like Cipó (Bahia), Iraí (Rio Grande do Sul) and Rio de Janeiro, especially in Copacabana. Also in the Brazilian Northeast — notably in countryside cities, such as Campina Grande in Paraiba State — there is a noticeable group of Art Deco buildings, which has been called “Sertanejo Art Deco” because of its peculiar architectural features.[28] The reason for the style being so widespread in Brazil is its coincidence with the fast growth and radical economic changes of the country during 1930-1940. Art deco buildings are also numerous in Montevideo, Uruguay, including the iconic Palacio Salvo, which was South America's tallest building when it was built in the late 1920s.
Much of the Art Deco heritage of Tulsa, Oklahoma remains from that city's oil boom days.[29]Houston, Texas has some surviving art deco buildings, although many are threatened by modern development.[30] Some examples are the Houston City Hall building, the J.P. Morgan Chase building and the 1940 Air Terminal Museum which is housed in the original airport terminal.
Napier, New Zealand, was rebuilt in the Art Deco style after being largely razed by an earthquake in 1931. Although a few Art Deco buildings were replaced with contemporary structures during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, most of the centre remained intact for long enough to become recognized as architecturally unique, and from the 1990s onwards had been protected and restored. As of 2007, Napier has been nominated for UNESCO World Heritage Site status, the first cultural site in New Zealand to be nominated.[31][32]
In London, the former Arsenal Stadium boasts the famous East Stand facade, which remains at the football club's old home at Highbury, in the borough of Islington, which was vacated in the summer of 2006. Opened in October 1936, the structure now has Grade II listed status and has been converted into flats. William Bennie, the man behind the project, famously used the Art Deco style in the final design which was seen as one of the most opulent and impressive stands in world football.
The Manila Metropolitan Theater located along P.Burgos Street in Manila is one of the few existing art deco buildings in the Philippines.
Valencia, Spain built profusely in Art Deco style during the period of economic bounty between wars in which Spain remained neutral. Particularly remarkable are the famous bath house Las Arenas, the building hosting the Rectorship of the University of Valencia and the cinemas Rialto (currently the Filmoteca de la Generalitat Valenciana), Capitol (reconverted into an office building) and Metropol.
Africa's most celebrated examples of art deco were built in Eritrea during Italian rule. Many buildings survive in Asmara, the capital, and elsewhere.

[edit] Influences
The distinctive style of Art Deco has been echoed in many similar movements since its early decline.[7] Art Deco influenced later styles such as Memphis and the Pop art movement.[12] It also had an effect on post modern architecture and styles, even through to the late 1970s.[7] Art Deco has also had a marked influence on contemporary design.[3]

[edit] House design in the United Kingdom
During the 1930s, Art Deco had a noticeable influence on house design in the United Kingdom,[13] as well as the design of various public buildings.[7] Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.[24][33][34]
