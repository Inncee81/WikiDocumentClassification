Sprezzatura, is a term that originates from Castiglione’s The Book of the Courtier. It is defined as “a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does or says appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it.”[1] That is to say, it is the ability of the courtier to display “an easy facility in accomplishing difficult actions which hides the conscious effort that went into them.”[2] Sprezzatura has also been described “as a form of defensive irony: the ability to disguise what one really desires, feels, thinks, and means or intends behind a mask of apparent reticence and nonchalance.”[3]

[edit] History
Castiglione wrote The Book of the Courtier as a portrayal of an idealized courtier - one that could successfully gain and keep favour from rulers and the nobility. The ideal courtier was supposed to be skilled in arms and in athletic events, and know the art of rhetoric, as well as the arts of music and dancing.[4] Since the ideal courtier was supposed to be able to do all of the above, the standard for the ideal courtier was set so high that it was practically unattainable. However, the courtier who had sprezzatura managed to make these difficult tasks look easy. Concerning sprezzatura, Castiglione said:

I have found quite a universal rule which in this matter seems to me valid above all other, and in all human affairs whether in word or deed: and that is to avoid affectation in every way possible as though it were some rough and dangerous reef; and (to pronounce a new word perhaps) to practice in all thing a certain sprezzatura [nonchalance], so as to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it.[5]

Thus, sprezzatura was essential to becoming the ideal courtier, because having this quality allowed courtiers to survive in the highly competitive world of the nobility. If courtiers had this quality, they could gracefully blend into the court.

[edit] The Positive and Negative Attributes of Sprezzatura
Sprezzatura was a vital quality for a courtier to have, since it allowed courtiers to gracefully adapt to the highly competitive environment of the court. Courtiers essentially had to put on a performance for their peers[6] and those who employed sprezzatura created the impression that they completely mastered the roles they played.[7] A courtier’s sprezzatura made him seem to be fully at ease in court and like someone who was “the total master of self, society’s rules, and even physical laws, and [his sprezzatura created] the distinct impression that he [was] unable to err.”[8] Moreover, courtiers who possessed sprezzatura could display their talents for their ruler to gain their favour without looking like they were putting on an act.[9]
However, while the quality of sprezzatura did have its benefits, this quality also had its downfalls. Since sprezzatura made difficult tasks seem effortless, those who possessed sprezzatura needed to be able to deceive people convincingly.[10] In a way, sprezzatura was “the art of acting deviously.”[11] This “art” created a “self-fulfilling culture of suspicion”[12] because courtiers had to be diligent in maintaining their façades. “The by-product of the courtier’s performance is that the achievement of sprezzatura may require him to deny or disparage his nature.”[13] Consequently, sprezzatura also had its downsides, since courtiers who excelled at sprezzatura risked losing themselves to the façade they put on for their peers.

[edit] Examples
Raphael was an artist who exemplified sprezzatura from the beginning of his career, starting with his first signed work The Marriage of the Virgin. “Inspired by his teacher Perugino’s rendering of the same subject, Raphael’s painting can be found to differ primarily from its model by its unique awareness of the importance of sprezzatura.”[14]




The Marriage of the Virgin by Raphael, 1504






The Marriage of the Virgin by Perugino, 1500-1504


Raphael’s painting reveals its awareness of the importance of sprezzatura through his representation of Joseph. Compared to Perugino’s more youthful representation of Joseph, Raphael’s version of Joseph is considerably more idealized and older. Perugino’s Joseph, despite his almost cloying sweetness in contrast to earlier depictions by other artists, retains a certain hardness of profile and angularity which Raphael has avoided by softening the anatomy of facial features and breaking the rigid profile ever so slightly.[15]
Additionally, “the poses and garments of the two also reveal a subtle transformation which reflects the same deliberate alteration of attitude.”[16] For instance, the gracefulness of Perugino’s Joseph is “emphasized by the highlighting of drapery and body. The easy S-like movement from ear to right toe is inescapably obvious.”[17] On the other hand, the grace displayed by Raphael’s Joseph “is equally great but perhaps more affecting since the manner of its expression is less obvious.”[18]
Joseph’s posture demonstrates an understated grace, since his slight turn toward the viewer tends to conceal the easy flow of line which characterizes the figure overall while he introduces any number of linear rhythms in the garment subordinate to the main movement of the figure. These variations, in addition to the deliberate avoidance of any dramatic highlights, help to explain why it is that we feel the “nonchalance” of Raphael’s Joseph in contrast to the almost hieratic frozen grace of Perugino’s. In the former we can detect that quality which Castiglione had in mind when he wrote: “Therefore we may call that art true at which does not seem to be art.”[19]
