Minitel 1. Built 1982


The Minitel is a Videotex online service accessible through the telephone lines, and is considered one of the world's most successful pre-World Wide Web online services. It was launched in France in 1982 by the PTT (Poste, Téléphone et Télécommunications; divided since 1991 between France Télécom and La Poste). From its early days, users could make online purchases, make train reservations, check stock prices, search the telephone directory, and chat in a similar way to that now made possible by the Internet.
Minitel was a joint development between France Télécom and British Telecom, prior to its privatisation. A similar service was delivered by British Telecom to UK subscribers under the name of Prestel, but was charged by the page rather than time. Although the UK service enjoyed some early success, changes to the way it was charged made by the post-privatised British Telecom, as well as the universal availability of the free teletext service, saw its complete demise.

[edit] Business model
Millions of terminals were handed out free to telephone subscribers, resulting in a high penetration rate among businesses and the public. In exchange for the terminal, the possessors of Minitel would not be given free "white page" printed directories (alphabetical list of residents and firms), but only the yellow pages (classified commercial listings, with advertisements); the white pages were accessible for free on Minitel, and they could be searched by a reasonably intelligent search engine; much faster than flipping through a paper directory.
France Télécom estimates that almost 9 million terminals — including web-enabled personal computers (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux) — had access to the network at the end of 1999, and that it was used by 25 million people (of a total population of 60 million).
The Minitel allowed access to various categories of services:

phone directory (free)
mail-order retail companies
airline or train ticket purchases
information services
databases
message boards

The development of Minitel spawned the creation of many start-up companies in a manner similar to the later dot-com bubble of Internet-related companies. Similarly, many of those small companies floundered and failed because of an overcrowded market or bad business practices (lack of infrastructure for online retailers). The messageries roses ("pink messages", adult chat services) and other pornographic sites were also criticized for their possible use by under-age children. The government chose not to enact coercive measures, however, claiming that the regulation of online activities of children was up to the parents, not the government. The government also enacted a tax on pornographic online services.

[edit] Finances
Payment methods

Credit card for purchases
Telephone bill for surfing time: rates depend on the sites visited

France Télécom charges Minitel users at rates of up to € 1 a minute on their monthly telephone bill. The rates depend on the service called; most services are far cheaper than the maximum. It then pays back part of the sum to the companies that operate Minitel servers.
In the late 1990s, Minitel connections were stable at 100 million a month plus 150 million online directory inquiries, in spite of growing Internet use.
In 1998, Minitel generated € 832 million ($1,121 million) of revenue, of which € 521 million was channelled by France Télécom to service providers.
Minitel sales in the late 1990s accounted for almost 15% of sales at La Redoute and Les Trois Suisses, France's biggest mail order companies. In 2005, the most popular Minitel application was Teleroute, the online real-time freight exchange, which accounted for nearly 8% of Minitel usage.
In 2005 there were 351 million calls for 18.51 million hours of connection, generating € 206 million of revenue, of which € 145 million were redistributed to 2000 service providers (these numbers are declining at around 30% per year). There were still 6 million terminals owned by France Télécom, which had been left with their users in order to avoid recycling problems. The main uses were banking and financial services, which benefit from Minitel's security features, and access to professional databases. France Télécom mentions, as an example of usage, that 12 million updates to personal vitale health-care cards were made through Minitel.[1]
On 11 February 2009 France Télécom and PagesJaunes announced that they were to cancel plans to end the Minitel service in March 2009. Its directory assistance service is still accessed over a million times a month.[2]

[edit] Technical
Minitel uses dumb terminals consisting of a text based screen, keyboard and modem. Simple graphics can be displayed using a set of predefined graphical characters. Aftermarket printers are available [3].
When connecting, the Minitel integrated modem generally dials a special number connecting to a PAVI (Point d'Accès VIdéotexte, "videotext access point"). The PAVI transmits information back on to the servers of the appropriate company or administration using the Transpac X.25 network.
In France the most common dial number was "36 15", while "36 17" was used by more expensive services. Minitel services names were often prefixed with this number to identify them as such, for example Google Minitel would have been called "36 15 Google". Thus the "36 15" prefix had the same meaning as the ".com" suffix now has for Internet web sites.
Minitel used a split baud rate system via its modem. It downlinked at 1200 baud and uplinked at 75 baud. This allowed fast (for the time) downloads using a full duplex system. The system, which came to be known as '1275' was more correctly known as V23. This system was developed solely for Minitel and its clones around the world. Other networks were restricted to 600 baud both ways due to technical limitations of the telephone network and modem technology.
Technically, Minitel refers to the terminals, while the network is known as Teletel.
Minitel terminals use the AZERTY keyboard most commonly used in French (as opposed to the QWERTY keyboard more common in the English-speaking world).

[edit] Minitel and the Internet
Minitel was often considered as an impediment for a fast deployment of the Internet in France, since it already provided safe and easy online access for many useful services without requiring a personal computer. Indeed, it still has advantages over the Internet: It does not require subscribing to a service, buying and maintaining a personal computer, and there are fewer security issues with respect to credit card payments and other personal information. Also, because Minitels follow well-defined standards, there are hardly any compatibility problems.
On the other hand, the argument has been made that thanks to the Minitel, the French were used to doing transactions online and have embraced the Internet as it offers more value and convenience than the Minitel.
In 1986 French university students coordinated a national strike using Minitel, demonstrating an early use of digital communication devices for participatory technopolitical ends.[4]

[edit] Minitel in other countries
Sweden: Swedish state-owned telephone company Televerket tried to introduce a similar service in 1991. It went out of service in 1993. They called it Teleguide, and their terminals were built by IBM.
South Africa: Videotext was introduced by Telkom in 1986 and named Beltel. The Minitel was introduced later to popularise the service.
Ireland: Minitel was introduced to Ireland by eircom (then called Telecom Eireann) in 1988. The system was based on the French model and Irish services were even accessible from France via the code"36 19 Irlande." A number of major Irish businesses came together to offer a range of online services including; directory information, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, airline reservations, news, weather and information services. The system was also the first platform in Ireland to offer users access to e-mail outside of a corporate setting. Despite being cutting edge for its time, the system failed to capture a large market and was ultimately withdrawn due to lack of commercial interest. The rise of the internet and other global online services in the early to mid 1990s played a major factor in the death of Irish Minitel. Minitel Ireland's terminals were technically identical to their French counterparts, except that they had a Qwerty keyboard and an RJ-11 telephone jack which is the standard telephone connector in Ireland.
The Netherlands: The then state-owned phone company PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel and Videotex Nederland[5]. The main difference was that Viditel used one big central host where Videotex used a central access system responsible for realizing the correct connection to the required host - owned and managed by others. The Videotex services offered access via several primary rate numbers and the information/service provider could choose the costs for accessing his service. Depending on the number used, tarrif could vary between nil (free) and one guilder (aprox. € 0,45) per minute. A private network named Travelnet used the same platform as Videotex Nl for the travel industry.
Canada: Bell Canada experimented with a Minitel-based system known as AlexTel. The system was technically similar to Minitel, with the exception that the telephone connector was modified to use the Bell System RJ-11 standard connectors. Originally launched experimentally in the Montreal area, "Alex" was then launched in most areas served by Bell Canada (primarily Ontario and Quebec) with offers of a free trial period and terminal. Although branded as a "bilingual" (English and French Canadian) service, the majority of the services offered were the experimental ones originally offered in Quebec and completely Francophone. Retention rates were reportedly close to zero. The service closed down shortly after exiting the experimental stage.
Belgium: Minitel was launched by Belgacom and successfully delivered services led by Teleroute until recently. It suffered a rapid decline following the extensive broadband rollout initiated by the Flemish regional government.
Germany: "Bildschirmtext" (BTX) is almost as old as Minitel, but it was largely unsuccessful because consumers had to buy expensive decoders to use it. The German postal service held a monopoly on the decoders that prevented competition and lower prices. Few people bought the boxes, so there was little incentive for companies to post content. When the monopoly was loosened, it was too late because PC-based online services had started to appear.
United States: In the 1990s, US West, (now Qwest), launched a Minitel service offered in its service areas called "CommunityLink." The service, a joint venture of US West and France Télécom, used Minitel-emulator software for the IBM PC, Commodore 64, Apple II, and other computers. The service was fairly short-lived, as competing offerings from providers like AOL, Prodigy, and CompuServe provided more services for a lower price. Many of US West's Minitel offerings were charged ala carte and/or hourly.
Italy: In 1986 the national telephone operator (SIP - Società italiana per l'esercizio telefonico now known as Telecom Italia) launched the Videotel service. The system use was charged on a per-page basis. Due to the excessive cost of the hardware and the expensive services, diffusion was very low, leading to the diffusion of a FidoNet-oriented movement. The service was shut down in 1994.
