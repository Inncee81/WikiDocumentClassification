American Edit is a mashup album released by Party Ben and team9 under the shared alias Dean Gray. Its primary basis is the Green Day album American Idiot — the name "Dean Gray" is a spoonerism of "Green Day".[1][2][3]
As an internet-only release with no intent of commercial gain, Dean Gray took an altruistic approach and asked for fans who enjoyed the album to donate to charities that Green Day have been known to support. Nevertheless, only 10 days after its November 18, 2005 release, the American Edit website was shut down, reportedly after receiving a cease and desist order from Green Day's label, Warner Records, despite the fact that Green Day lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong expressed an interest after hearing "Boulevard of Broken Songs" on the radio. The website returned online soon after, without the music.
91X, a radio station in San Diego, played the entire album shortly before Dean Gray Tuesday.
In August 2006, a condensed live version of American Edit was performed as a "mashup rock opera" at a Bootie party at DNA Lounge in San Francisco. Entitled Dean Gray - American Edit: The Theatrical Experience, the show – presented by the band Smash-Up Derby and starring performance artist Foxy Cotton – was a combination of live music, theatre, and visuals.
In 2008 an unofficial extended version of the album was released on The Pirate Bay. Subtitled "Deluxe Edition 2008", the new album featured 4 new songs by DJ Pegasus, who had no part in the original album: Can't Get A Life, Country Basket, I Like American Idiots and Greenday Triple Tracker.
The track, "The Bad Homecoming", would precipitate an actual collaboration between U2 and Green Day in 2006: a cover of "The Saints Are Coming".

[edit] Dean Gray Tuesday
As a protest against the shutdown, Portland-based fan World Famous Audio Hacker organized "Dean Gray Tuesday" (an intended evocation of 2004's Grey Tuesday). On December 13, 2005, the album was hosted on a number of participating websites as torrents, direct MP3 downloads or ZIP archives. Video clips of "Dr. Who on Holiday", "American Jesus" and "Boulevard of Broken Songs" were also made available. The shutdown and protest contributed to international press coverage beyond the music industry.
