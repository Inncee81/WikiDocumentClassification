Digital poetry is a form of electronic literature with a wide range of approaches to poetry that all have in common prominent and crucial use of computers. Digital poetry can be available on the World Wide Web or Internet (via email lists, for instance), CD ROM, DVD, as installations in art galleries, in certain cases also recorded as DV or film.
A significant portion of current publications of poetry are available either only online or via some combination of online and offline publication. There are many types of 'digital poetry' such as hypertext, kinetic poetry, computer generated animation, digital visual poetry, code poetry, experimental video poetry, and poetries that take advantage of the programmable nature of the computer to create works that are interactive, or use generative or combinatorial approach to create text (or one of its states), or involve sound poetry, or take advantage of things like listservs, blogs, and other forms of network communication to create communities of collaborative writing and publication (as in poetical wikis).
Digital computers allow the creation of art that spans different media: text, images, sounds, and interactivity via programming. Contemporary poetries have, therefore, taken advantage of this toward the creation of works that synthesize both arts and media. Whether a work is poetry or visual art or music or programming is sometimes not clear, but we expect an intense engagement with language in poetical works.

Some pioneers of e-poetry in Europe, developing Italian and Russian Futurism, concrete poetry, visual poetry, performance, interactive art, hypertext include:

Joan Brossa (E)

(Barcelona 1919 - 1998) In 1977 the Catalan poet, playwright, graphic designer and plastic artist Joan Brossa experimented with a computer in order to compose sestinas, one of his favourite forms. After inputting the formula of this poem and the six rhyme-words, the computer composed hundreds of sestinas. However only one interested the poet, and so has been published under the title "Cybernetic sestina" (Brossa, Joan. Viatge per la sextina. Barcelona: Quaderns Crema, 1987, p. 116).
