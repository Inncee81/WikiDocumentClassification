[edit] The fastest Distributed Computers




The PlayStation 3 Folding@home client displays a 3D model of the protein being simulated



Folding@Home is of April 2009 sustaining over 8.1 PFLOPS [1], the first computing project of any kind to cross the four petaFLOPS milestone. This level of performance is primarily enabled by the cumulative effort of a vast array of PlayStation 3 and powerful GPU units.[2]
The entire BOINC averages over 1.5 PFLOPS as of March 15, 2009[3].
SETI@Home computes data averages more than 528 TFLOPS[4]
Einstein@Home is crunching more than 150 TFLOPS[5]
As of August 2008[update], GIMPS is sustaining 27 TFLOPS.[6]

Intel Corporation has recently unveiled the experimental multi-core POLARIS chip, which achieves 1 TFLOPS at 3.13 GHz. The 80-core chip can increase this result to 2 TFLOPS at 6.26 GHz, although the thermal dissipation at this frequency exceeds 190 watts[7].
As of 2008, the fastest PC processors (quad-core) perform over 70 GFLOPS (Intel Core i7 965 XE) in double precision[8]. GPUs are considerably more powerful, for example, in the GeForce 200 Series the nVidia GTX 280 performs around 933 GFLOPS on 240 processing elements in single precision calculations[9], and that while GPUs are highly efficient at single precision calculations they are not as flexible as a general purpose CPUs in double precision operations.
