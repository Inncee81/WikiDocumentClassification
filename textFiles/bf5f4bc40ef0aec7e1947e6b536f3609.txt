From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
There are a variety of specifications associated with web services. These specifications are in varying degrees of maturity and are maintained or supported by various standards bodies and entities. Specifications may complement, overlap, and compete with each other. Web service specifications are occasionally referred to collectively as "WS-*", though there is not a single managed set of specifications that this consistently refers to, nor a recognized owning body across them all. The reference term "WS-*" is more of a general nod to the fact that many specifications are named with "WS-" as their prefix. This page includes many of the specifications that might be considered a part of "WS-*".
