[edit] Life and Work

[edit] Entrepreneurship
Vardi started his entrepreneurial career at the age of 26, in 1969, when he co-founded and was the first CEO of Tekem, one of the very first software houses in Israel (which became the largest software company at the time, was sold to Tadiran, went public and now is part of Ness). Through the years he also co-founded Alon oil company, ITL (International Laser Technologies, went public), Granite Hacarmel (went public) and others. In 1996 he became the founding investor of Mirabilis (company) - the creator of ICQ, which is the first Internet-wide Instant messaging. Since then he focused on early stage internet and mobile start ups. Among the companies he invested in, or helped to build are fring, Answers.com (went public), Gteko (sold to Microsoft), Airlink (sold to Sierra Wireless), Tivella (sold to Cisco), Scopus (went public), CTI2 (sold to Audiocodes), speedbit, Foxytunes (sold to yahoo), Tucows (went public), and Starnet (sold to IAC/InterActiveCorp). He serves on the advisory board of Amdocs.

[edit] Cultural Impact
Mirabilis, which practically had no revenues, was sold to AOL just 19 months after it released its product for over 400 million dollars. The sale inspired a whole generation of young Israelis, creating a wave of start ups. In recent years Vardi is actively engaged in founding and helping young internet companies.
