From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Combinatorial optimization is a branch of optimization. Its domain is optimization problems where the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be reduced to a discrete one, and the goal is to find the best possible solution.
It is a branch of applied mathematics and computer science, related to operations research, algorithm theory and computational complexity theory that sits at the intersection of several fields, including artificial intelligence, mathematics and software engineering.

[edit] Example problems

Vehicle routing problem
Traveling salesman problem
Minimum spanning tree problem
Linear programming (if the solution space is the choice of which variables to make basic)
Eight queens puzzle. (A constraint satisfaction problem. When applying standard combinatorial optimization algorithms to this problem, one would usually treat the goal function as the number of unsatisfied constraints (say number of attacks) rather than as a single boolean indicating whether the whole problem is satisfied or not.)
Knapsack problem
Cutting stock problem


[edit] Methods
Heuristic search methods (metaheuristic algorithms) as those listed below have been used to solve problems of this type.


Local search
Simulated annealing
Quantum annealing
GRASP
Swarm intelligence
Tabu search
Genetic algorithms
Ant colony optimization
Reactive search
Bees algorithm
Hopfield net
Self-organizing map

Discrete optimization
Search algorithm
Brute-force search

A question of great interest is whether one search method is superior in performance to others across all problems. For a broad class of algorithms, the answer is no:

No free lunch in search and optimization
