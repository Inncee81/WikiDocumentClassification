A regular {7/3} heptagram known as the Elven Star or Fairy Star is used by some members of the otherkin subculture as an identifier.[1]


Otherkin are a subculture of people, primarily Internet-based, who identify in some way as other than human. Otherkin often believe themselves to be mythological or legendary creatures, explaining their beliefs through reincarnation, having a nonhuman soul, ancestry, or symbolic metaphor.[1]
Common creatures otherkin identify as include angels, demons, dragons, elves, extra-terrestrials, fairies, kitsune, lycanthropes, and vampires, among others.[2][3]
Amongst people outside the subculture, otherkin beliefs are usually met with disbelief.[4]

[edit] History of Otherkin
The oldest Internet resource for otherkin is the Elvenkind Digest; a mailing list started in 1990 by a student at the University of Kentucky for "elves and interested observers". Also in the early 1990s, newsgroups such as alt.horror.werewolves[5] and alt.fan.dragons on Usenet, which were initially created for fans of these creatures in the context of fantasy and horror literature and films, also developed followings which identified as mythological beings.[1][6]
On 6 February 1995, a document titled the "Elven Nation Manifesto" was posted to Usenet, including the groups alt.pagan and alt.magick. On Usenet itself, the document was universally panned and considered to be either a troll or an attempt to frame an innocent party. However, enough people contacted the original author of the Elven Nation post in good faith for a mailing list to spin off from it.[7]
The modern otherkin subculture grew out of these elven online communities of the early-to-mid-1990s[7], with the earliest recorded use of the term otherkin appearing in July of 1990 and the variant otherkind being reported as early as April 1990.[1] The therian, vampire, and draconic subcultures are related to the otherkin community somewhat, and are considered part of it by most otherkin, but are culturally distinct movements of their own despite some overlap in membership.[1]
