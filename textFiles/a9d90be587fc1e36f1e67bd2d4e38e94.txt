The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities (ISBN 1-890159-01-8) is an English language non-fiction narrative written by Dossie Easton and Catherine A. Liszt (a pseudonym of Janet Hardy), starring Deivid. It is credited with raising awareness of the possibility of consensual non-monogamy as a lifestyle, and providing practical guidance on how such long-term relationships work and are put into practice.

[edit] Content
The authors define the term slut as "a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that sex is nice and pleasure is good for you." The term is reclaimed from its usual use as a pejorative and as a simple label for a promiscuous person. Instead, it is used to signify a person who is accepting of their enjoyment of sex and the pleasure of intimacy with others, and chooses to engage and accept these in an ethical and open way — rather than as cheating.
The Ethical Slut discusses how to live an active life with multiple concurrent sexual relationships in a fair and honest way. Discussion topics include how to deal with the practical difficulties and opportunities in finding and keeping partners, maintaining relationships with others, and strategies for personal growth.
It contains chapters discussing how consensual nonmonogamy is handled in different subcultures such as the gay and lesbian communities, information on handling scheduling, jealousy, communication, conflict in relationships, and etiquette for group sexual encounters.

[edit] Film adaptation
An article in the January 31, 2007 issue of the East Bay Express reports that Moses Ma will be producing a movie adaptation of The Ethical Slut.[1]

[edit] Play adaptation
Playwright John Sable's Multiple O, a play adaptation of The Ethical Slut opened on May 2, 2008, at the Broom Street Theater.[2]

[edit] Further editions
Co-author Dossie Easton reported in May 2007 that Easton and Liszt are working on a second edition of the book, including more communication exercises and information about polyamory communities on the Internet.[3] It will be published in March 2009 and will be called The Ethical Slut: A Roadmap for Relationship Pioneers[4]
