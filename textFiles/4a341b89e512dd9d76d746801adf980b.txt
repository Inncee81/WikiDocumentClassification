Example of a Sankey diagram


Sankey diagrams are a specific type of flow diagram, in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity. The arrows always flow from left to right. They are typically used to visualize energy or material transfers between processes.

[edit] Application
Sankey diagrams are used in chemical engineering or environmental engineering to show flow quantities in process systems. They are also commonly used to visualize the energy accounts or material flow accounts on a regional or national level. Sankey diagrams put a visual emphasis on the major transfers or flows within a system. They are helpful in locating dominant contributions to an overall flow. Ideally, Sankey diagrams are showing conservative units within defined system boundaries, typically energy or mass.
Sankey diagrams are named after Irish Captain Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey, who is considered to have been the first to use this type of diagram in 1898 in a publication on the energy efficiency of a steam engine (see reproduction in[1], page 8). While the first charts in black and white were merely used to display one type of flow (e.g steam), using colors for different types of flows has added more degrees of freedom to Sankey diagrams.

[edit] Software
There are a number of software tools that support the drawing of Sankey diagrams:

e!Sankey - Software for Sankey diagrams
Sankey Editor - Static und dynamic Sankey diagrams
Umberto - Material flow software with Sankey diagrams
SankeyHelper - a free tool to create Sankey diagrams in MSExcel
visTABLE(R)touch - tool for factory layout planning including Sankey visualisation of matieral flow relationships
Visio Sankey Diagram Shapes - from Visio Guy, for use with Microsoft Visio
Visio Pre-wired Sankey Diagram Shapes - from Visio Guy, for use with Microsoft Visio
