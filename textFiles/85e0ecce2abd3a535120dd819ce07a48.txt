From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Kancho (カンチョー ,kanchō?)[1] is an act often played out in Japan; it is performed by clasping the hands together so the index fingers are pointing out and attempting to insert them sharply into someone's anal region when the victim is not looking.[2] It is similar to the wedgie or a goosing, although the latter acts do not involve direct intimate physical contact. A Kancho is often executed simultaneously as the offending party expresses loudly "Kan-CHO!"

[edit] Etymology
The word is a slang adoption of the Japanese word for enema (浣腸 ,kanchō?). In accordance with widespread practice, the word is generally written in katakana when used in its slang sense, and in kanji when used of enemas in the medical sense.

[edit] Scope
The prank is pervasive in Japan. There are children's cartoons glorifying this act (such as the anime Naruto, where it has been called the Thousand Years of Death). In Japan, there is even a TV gameshow where a celebrity routinely kanchōs random people.
This prank is not exclusive to Japan. In South Korea, it is known as "ttong chim" (also Romanized as "dong chim" or "ddong chim" and roughly translating to "poop needle") and in the Philippines, it is known as "bembong", "bombet" or "pidyok", from the Filipino word "tumbong" for tailbone.
In certain countries, the act of kancho may be illegal and considered sexual harassment, or even sexual assault, although children are given more leniency. While the practice is known in South Korea, there have been cases where adults performing it have been arrested. However, in Japan it is considered a childish prank rather than a criminal act.[citation needed]
