See Art periods for a chronological list.

This is a list of art movements. These terms, helpful for curricula or anthologies, evolved over time to group artists who are often loosely related. Some of these movements were defined by the members themselves, while other terms emerged decades or centuries after the periods in question. Ordering is approximate, as there is considerable overlap.
