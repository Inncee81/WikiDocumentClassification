[edit] Personal life
Will Self was raised, in his words, in "an effortlessly dull" North London suburb by "intellectually snobbish parents". Self's father, Peter Self, was a professor in Political Sciences at the London School of Economics, and his mother who was a Jewish-American émigré. Self is Jewish, albeit not practising.[1] Despite the intellectual encouragement given by his parents, Self was an emotionally confused and self-destructive child, harming himself with cigarette ends and knives before getting into drugs in his teenage years.[2] As mentioned on an episode of Have I Got News For You, he attended University College School with Hugh Dennis where they played rugby together.
Self was a voracious reader from a young age. At ten an interest into science fiction grew, with notable works such as Frank Herbert's Dune, J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick reflecting the precociousness of Self's reading. Into his teenage years, Self claimed to have been "overawed by the canon", stifling his ability to express himself. Nevertheless, Self's dabbling with illegal drugs grew analogous to his vehement reading. By nine he had a taste for alcohol,[citation needed] at thirteen he was smoking marijuana.[citation needed] By the time Self was eighteen his tastes had extended into the realm of heroin.[citation needed] However, Self still won a place at Exeter College, Oxford where he read philosophy.
His reasons for not studying English, as one may assume, were covered by Self in an interview with the Guardian.

"I [had] a pretty thorough grounding in the canon, but I certainly didn't want to be involved with criticism. Even then it seemed inimical to what it was to be a writer, which is what I really wanted to be."[3]

Self was addicted to heroin, as well as many other drugs, in the past, but has since abstained, except for caffeine and nicotine since 1998.[4]
He currently lives in Stockwell, South London,[5] and has written about hikes he has taken around the city, of distances up to 100 miles. In December 2006, he walked 26 miles from his home in South London to Heathrow Airport. Upon arriving in the United States, he walked a further 20 miles from Kennedy Airport to the Crowne Plaza in Manhattan.[4] He has described himself as a modern flâneur.[6]

[edit] Family
Self has been twice married. He was married to Katherine (Kate) Sylvia Chancellor, from 1989 to 1997. Kate is a daughter of John Chancellor[7] by his first wife Hon. (Mary) Alice Joliffe (herself daughter of William Jolliffe, 4th Baron Hylton and a great-granddaughter of H.H. Asquith, British Prime Minister in the early 20th century). Kate is also the older sister of actress Anna Chancellor, and the niece of journalist Alexander Chancellor. Together they had two children, a son Alexis and a daughter Madeleine.
In 1997, Self married Deborah Jane Orr,[8] a journalist, with whom he has two sons called Ivan and Luther.
His brother is the author, Jonathan Self.

[edit] Career
Will Self has made several appearances on British television, notably as a contestant on Have I Got News for You (as of 2007 he has made nine guest appearances, a record for people who haven't been host of the show), as a regular on Shooting Stars and Grumpy Old Men, a guest appearance on Satisfied Fool and a full episode of Room 101. He has also been a panellist on the BBC Radio 4 comedy series "The Unbelievable Truth". He gained a degree of infamy in 1997 when he was sent by the British broadsheet The Observer to cover the electoral campaign of John Major, and was subsequently fired from the newspaper after taking heroin on the Prime Minister's jet.[3] In December 2008, Self appeared on BBC One's Question Time.
His Psychogeography column appeared in the magazine section of the Saturday edition of The Independent. He has also written for the New Statesman and Prospect magazine.

[edit] Literary style
Like Salman Rushdie, Will Self writes much of his fiction with references and allusions to modern culture (both high and low)[citation needed]. The influences on his fiction mentioned most frequently include J.G. Ballard, William Burroughs and Hunter S. Thompson often not for purely literary reasons. Alongside these he has cited[citation needed] such diverse writers as Jonathan Swift, Alasdair Gray, Franz Kafka, Lewis Carroll, Joseph Heller and Louis-Ferdinand Celine as formative influences on his writing style. Martin Amis is often mentioned alongside Self; Self went to interview him but they ended up having more of a discussion about each other's work and lives — it is known that they have tremendous respect for each other.[5]
Zack Busner is a recurring character in the fiction of Will Self, appearing in the short story collections The Quantity Theory of Insanity, Grey Area, Dr. Mukti and Other Tales of Woe, as well as in the novels Great Apes and The Book of Dave. Busner is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst practising in London, and is prone to self-promotion at the expense of his patients. He is often the antagonist of the stories he appears in, although not always with villainous intent.
