From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The Academic Ranking of World Universities[1] is compiled by Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s Institute of Higher Education and includes major institutes of higher education ranked according to a formula that took into account alumni winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals (10 percent), staff winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals (20 percent), “highly-cited researchers in 21 broad subject categories” (20 percent), articles published in Nature and Science (20 percent), the Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (20 percent) and the per capita academic performance (on the indicators above) of an institution (10 percent). The results have been cited by The Economist magazine [2] as well as Nature magazine [3]. The methodology is set out in an academic article by its originators, C.C. Liu and Y. Cheng[4]. Liu and Cheng explain that the original purpose of doing the ranking was “to find out the gap between Chinese universities and world-class universities, particularly in terms of academic or research performance.”[5] The rankings have been conducted since 2003.
College and university rankings often stimulate controversy (see Criticism of college and university rankings (North America) and Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)) and the ARWU is no exception. A 2007 paper published in the journal Scientometrics found that the results from the Shanghai rankings could not be reproduced from raw data using the method described by Liu and Cheng.[6]

[edit] Rankings
The table below contains the rankings from 2003 to 2008 for all universities which ranked at least 100 in one of the years.[1] The ranking is omitted for years in which the school did not land within the top 100. Note, the full ranking contains over 500 universities. If a university is not listed in this table, it fell below 100 in all six years.
