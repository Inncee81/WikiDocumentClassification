[edit] Early life
Jeff Skoll was born in Montreal, Quebec,[2] his mother a teacher[3] and his father a chemical company owner who sold industrial chemicals.[4] The family settled in Toronto in the late seventies.
When Jeff Skoll was fourteen his father was diagnosed with cancer which prompted him to discuss with his son how much he regretted not having had the time to do everything he had planned in life. A keen reader, Skoll was influenced by authors such as Aldous Huxley and Ayn Rand and intended to become an author writing motivational books and books on tackling the world's problems.
He graduated with a BASc with honours in 1987 from the University of Toronto's electrical engineering program. While an undergraduate student, he co-edited the engineering students' satirical newspaper The Toike Oike. He paid his way through college by pumping gas in North York, Ontario. After graduating he backpacked around the world for several months before returning and founding two businesses in Toronto: Skoll Engineering, an information technology consulting firm and Micros on the Move Ltd., a computer rental firm.
He left Canada in 1993 to study a Masters of Business Administration at Stanford Business School, graduating in 1995. After Stanford he went to work at Knight-Ridder where he was working on internet projects for the publishing company.

[edit] Skoll's eBay era
In 1996 Skoll met eBay's founder Pierre Omidyar who hired him as the company's first president and first full-time employee. While eBay was already profitable at the time Skoll joined, he wrote the business plan that eBay followed from its emergence as a start-up to a great success. He remained President until the arrival of Meg Whitman in January 1998 when he became Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis until back problems necessitated his departure from full-time employment at the company. In 1998, he championed the creation of the eBay Foundation which was allocated pre-IPO stock now worth $32 million. Once eBay's second largest stockholder (behind only Omidyar) he subsequently cashed out a portion of his company holdings, yielding him around $2 billion [5][3].

[edit] Participant Media
Skoll is also the founder, chairman and owner of Participant Media (formerly Participant Productions), a Los Angeles based media company he created to fund feature films and documentaries that promote social values while still being commercially viable. Its first three films were Syriana, Good Night, and Good Luck, and North Country along with the documentary Murderball. These films accounted for 11 Oscar nominations in 2006.
Subsequent films have included An Inconvenient Truth, American Gun, Fast Food Nation, and The World According to Sesame Street. An Inconvenient Truth won two Oscars in 2007 and has been credited with extending the public debate over climate change. Other films in 2007 included Charlie Wilson's War with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, The Kite Runner directed by Marc Forster, Angels in the Dust about an AIDS orphanage in South Africa, Darfur Now about the genocide in Darfur with Don Cheadle and Jimmy Carter Man from Plains, a film about Jimmy Carter directed by Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme.
Films in 2008 included The Visitor by Thomas McCarthy with Richard Jenkins and Hiam Abbass, Chicago 10 based on the 1968 Democratic convention protests and Standard Operating Procedure a documentary about Abu Ghraib by Errol Morris. Upcoming films in 2009 include The Soloist by Joe Wright with Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr, Food Inc a documentary about the corporatization of the food industry, The Informant with Matt Damon, directed by Stephen Soderbergh, The Cove the Sundance 2009 prize-winning documentary about the annual dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan, The Crazies an updated version of the George Romero biotoxin thriller from the 1970's and Pressure Cooker a documentary about an inner-city school cooking contest, set in Philadelphia. One announced 2010 release, set for Earth Day on April 22, is Oceans, a documentary about the oceans by Jacques Perrin, director of the Oscar winning Winged Migration.
The company also has publishing and television divisions and operates Takepart.com, an online site catering to social activists.

[edit] Philanthropies
Skoll is a noted philanthropist and has been honoured many times for his generosity. He has given the eponymous Skoll Foundation approximately $1 billion of eBay stock since its formation in 1999. The Foundation supports "social entrepreneurship." Skoll chairs the Foundation and today makes grants in excess of $80M per year. The Skoll Foundation's assets rank it as the largest foundation for Social Entrepreneurship in the world.
Skoll's largest charitable donation was a $30 million contribution to the Alliance for Climate Protection Campaign.
Skoll's recent honors and awards include The Producers Guild of America Visionary Award (2009),Time Magazine's 100 People of the Year (2006), Wired Magazine's Rave Award (2006), the National Leadership Award for Commonwealth Club Silicon Valley (2004) and the Outstanding Philanthropist Award from the International Association of Fundraising Professionals (2003). In 2003, Skoll was the commencement speaker and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto.
In addition, Skoll has financed The Gandhi Project in partnership with Relief International which created a dubbed version in Arabic of the film Gandhi. They used Palestinian voice actors and artists to make the film particularly relevant to Palestinians. With Skoll's support, it is being screened throughout Palestine to promote non-violence, self-reliance, economic development, and empowerment.

[edit] Other interests
