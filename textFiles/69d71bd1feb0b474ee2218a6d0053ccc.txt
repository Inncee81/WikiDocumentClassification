Ted Chiang (born 1967) is an American speculative fiction writer. He was born in Port Jefferson, New York and graduated from Brown University with a Computer Science degree. He currently works as a technical writer in the software industry and resides in Bellevue, near Seattle, Washington.
Although not a prolific author, having published only 11 short stories as of 2009, Chiang has to date won a string of prestigious speculative fiction awards for his works: a Nebula Award for "Tower of Babylon" (1990), the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1992, a Nebula Award and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for "Story of Your Life" (1998), a Sidewise Award for "Seventy-Two Letters" (2000), a Nebula Award, Locus Award and Hugo Award for his novelette "Hell Is the Absence of God" (2002) - and most recently, a Nebula and Hugo Award for his novelette "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate" (2007).
Chiang turned down a Hugo nomination for his short story "Liking What You See: A Documentary" in 2003, on the grounds that the story was rushed due to editorial pressure and did not turn out as he had really wanted [1].
Chiang's first eight stories are collected in Stories of Your Life, and Others (1st US hardcover ed: ISBN 0-7653-0418-X; 1st US paperback ed.: ISBN 0-7653-0419-8). His novellette The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate was also published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.
In a recent interview (May 19, 2008) [2], Chiang mentioned that he is currently writing a couple of new stories, with one being a novella that explores the theme of artificial intelligence.
