Masamune Shirow (士郎 正宗 ,Shirō Masamune?) is an internationally renowned manga artist, born Masanori Ota (太田 まさのり Ōta Masanori)[1] on November 23, 1961.
Masamune Shirow is a pen name, based on a famous swordsmith, Masamune. He is best known for the manga Ghost in the Shell, which has since been turned into three anime movies, two anime TV series and several video games. Shirow is also popular for creating erotic art.
Born in the Hyōgo Prefecture capital city of Kobe, he studied oil painting at Osaka University of Arts. While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, Black Magic, which was published in the manga fanzine Atlas. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.
The result was Appleseed, a full volume of densely-plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of Black Magic and a second volume of Appleseed, he released Dominion in 1986. Two more volumes of Appleseed followed before he began work on Ghost in the Shell.
In 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series Shinreigari/Ghost Hound, Production I.G's 20th year anniversary project.
A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April, 2008, titled Real Drive.

[edit] Fame
Shirow is a world-famous illustrator. Indeed, for a time, he was more popular outside of Japan than inside.[citation needed] He was chosen as an early author to bring to the West because of many stylistic similarities between his work and traditional American comics.
Ghost in the Shell is a famous anime in the West based on his work, hence his popularity. Many people mistake him for the creator of the original anime movie, but he had no major role in its production. Mamoru Oshii directed both movies, which were adaptations of several chapters of the original manga put to film. However, he did play a role in the development of the TV anime series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex.

[edit] Heroine with a single face
Many of his works (Ghost in the Shell, Dominion: Tank Police, Appleseed) follow a common form: a strong female law enforcement officer/warrior battles external threats while facing difficulties from internal politics, in a near-future setting with strong cyberpunk and postcyberpunk influences.
His female lead characters (Motoko Kusanagi in Ghost in the Shell, Leona Ozaki in Tank Police, Deunan Knute (or Deunan Nats) in Appleseed, and Seska in Orion) tend to look very similar to each other, with the exception of hair color.

[edit] Art
Although his work is clearly contemporary manga in style, a substantial amount of Shirow's work has been released in artbook or poster book format focusing on female characters in provocative poses and various degrees of nudity.
