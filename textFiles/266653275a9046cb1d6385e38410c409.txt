Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a Linux distribution produced by Red Hat and targeted toward the commercial market, including mainframes. Red Hat commits to supporting each version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for 7 years after its release. All of Red Hat's official support, all of Red Hat's training and the Red Hat Certification Program center is on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is often abbreviated to RHEL, even if Red Hat is now attempting to discourage this[1].
New versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are released every 18 to 24 months. When Red Hat releases a new version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, customers may upgrade to the new version at no additional charge as long as they are in possession of a current subscription (i.e. the subscription term has not yet lapsed).
Red Hat's first Enterprise offering (Red Hat Linux 6.2E) essentially consisted of a version of Red Hat Linux 6.2 with different support levels, and without separate engineering.
The first version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to bear the name originally came onto the market as "Red Hat Linux Advanced Server". In 2003 Red Hat rebranded Red Hat Linux Advanced Server to "Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS", and added two more variants, Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS.
Verbatim copying and redistribution of the entire Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution is not permitted due to trademark restrictions.[2] However, there are several redistributions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux minus trademarked features (such as logos and the name).

[edit] Variants
As of 2005[update] Red Hat distributed four variants of Red Hat Enterprise Linux:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS for mission-critical/enterprise computer systems.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES for supported network servers
Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS for technical power-user desktops or high-performance computing
Red Hat Desktop – for multiple deployments of single-user desktops

There are also "Academic" editions of the Desktop and Server variants. They are offered to schools and students, are less expensive, and are provided with Red Hat technical support as an optional extra. Web support based on number of customer contacts can be purchased separately.
It is often assumed the branding ES and AS stand for "Enterprise Server" and "Advanced Server", respectively. The reason for this is that the ES product is indeed the company's base enterprise server product, while AS is the more advanced product. However, nowhere on its site or in its literature does Red Hat say what AS, ES and WS stand for. In contrast, Novell has a competing server distribution called SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, which is abbreviated to SLES.
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 there are new editions that substitute former Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS/ES/WS/Desktop:[3]

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Platform (former AS)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (former ES) (limited to 2 CPU-s)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Workstation and Multi-OS option
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Workstation option (former WS)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Multi-OS option
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop (former Desktop)

Red Hat also announced its Red Hat Global Desktop Linux edition "for emerging markets"[4]

[edit] Relationship to free or community distributions
Originally, Red Hat based Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Red Hat Linux, but using a much more conservative release cycle. Later versions leveraged technologies from Fedora which is a community distribution and project that Red Hat sponsors. Roughly every third version of Red Hat Linux (RHL) or Fedora forms the basis for a version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, thus:

Red Hat Linux 6.2 → Red Hat Linux 6.2E
Red Hat Linux 7.2 → Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1
Red Hat Linux 9 → Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
Fedora Core 3 → Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
Fedora Core 6 → Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
Fedora 10 / Fedora 11 → Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (planned for release in the first quarter of 2010[5])


[edit] Rebuilds
Main article: Red Hat Enterprise Linux derivatives
Originally, Red Hat's enterprise product, then known as Red Hat Linux, was made freely available to anybody who wished to download it, while Red Hat made money from support. Red Hat then moved towards splitting its product line into Red Hat Enterprise Linux which was designed to be stable and with long-term support for enterprise users and 'Fedora' as the community distribution and project sponsored by Red Hat. The use of trademarks prevents verbatim copying of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux is based completely on free and open source software, Red Hat makes available the complete source code to its enterprise distribution through its FTP site to anybody who wants it. Accordingly, several groups have taken this source code and compiled their own versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, typically with the only changes being the removal of any references to Red Hat's trademarks and pointing the update systems to non-Red Hat servers. Groups which have undertaken this effort include CentOS (the most popular as of March 2009),[6] StartCom Enterprise Linux, Pie Box Enterprise Linux, Scientific Linux, X/OS, White Box Enterprise Linux, Cisco Unified Communications Manager[7], and Lineox. Oracle Corporation has also recently come out with its own repackaging of Red Hat Enterprise Linux called Oracle Enterprise Linux as part of its Unbreakable Linux program but does not provide a free mechanism for applying updates without paying a service fee as with Red Hat.
Rebuilds of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are free but do not get any commercial support or consultancy services from Red Hat and lack any software, hardware or security certifications. Also, the rebuilds do not get access to Red Hat services like Red Hat Network.

[edit] Commercial products based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

A number of commercial vendors use Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a base for the operating system in their products. The most well-known is the Console Operating System in VMware ESX Server.
