Syriana is a 2005 geopolitical thriller film written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, and executive produced by George Clooney, who also stars in the film with an ensemble cast. Gaghan's screenplay is loosely adapted from Robert Baer's memoir See No Evil. The film focuses on petroleum politics, and the global influence of the oil industry, whose political, economic, legal, and social effects are experienced by a CIA operative (George Clooney), an energy analyst (Matt Damon), a Washington attorney (Jeffrey Wright), and a young unemployed Pakistani migrant worker (Mazhar Munir) in an Arab country in the Persian Gulf.
As with Gaghan's screenplay for Traffic, Syriana uses multiple, parallel storylines, jumping from locations in Texas, Washington D.C., Switzerland, Spain, and the Middle East, leading film critic Roger Ebert to describe the film as hyperlink cinema.
Clooney won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Agent Bob Barnes, and Gaghan's script was nominated by the Academy for Best Original Screenplay. As of April 20, 2006, the film grossed a total of $50.82 million in the U.S. box office and $42.9 million in the rest of the world, for a total of $93.73 million.

[edit] Plot
American energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle-East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) has granted natural-gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the American oil industry and the energy interests of the U.S. government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company which recently won the drilling rights to key oil fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and American antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice (DOJ) have misgivings. The Washington law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, alleviating any allegations of corruption.




The filmmakers used the exterior of the Royal Mirage hotel in Dubai as the emir's estate in Marbella, Spain.


Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. At the party, Woodman is prevented from speaking directly with the emir, who is busy showing off the estate's remotely controlled electronic systems to Chinese oil executives. They try to control the swimming pool's lighting system, but it is not working due to faulty wiring. As this is happening, Woodman's son jumps in the pool and is electrocuted.
In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US$75 million, and invites Woodman to become his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform, and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir desires to utilize his nation's oil profits to diversify the economy and introduce democratic reforms, in sharp contrast to his father's repressive government, which has been supported by American interests. Woodman and his wife drift apart as he becomes more involved in working with the Prince and she even questions whether he is trading on the tragedy that took their son's life. Nasir hopes to succeed his father as emir, but his younger brother is willing to continue the status quo and American military presence, and is chosen as the King's successor instead even though he's clearly unqualified to run a nation. Nasir plans a military coup, but American intelligence plans to assassinate him via a remote missile attack on his convoy.

[edit] Assassination storyline
Robert Barnes (George Clooney) is a veteran CIA Operations Officer, trying to stop Middle Eastern illegal arms trafficking. While on assignment in Tehran to assassinate two Iranian arms dealers, Barnes notices that an anti-tank missile intended to participate in the explosion was diverted to an Arab. Barnes makes his superiors nervous by writing memos about the missile theft, and is subsequently reassigned to a desk job; however, unaccustomed to the political discretion required, he quickly embarrasses the wrong person by speaking his mind and is sent back to the field with the assignment of assassinating Prince Nasir. Prior to his reassignment, Barnes confides with his ex-CIA agent friend, Stan Goff (William Hurt), about returning to Lebanon and Goff advises him to clear his presence with Hezbollah so they know he is not acting against them. Barnes travels to Lebanon and obtains safe passage from a Hezbollah leader, and hires a mercenary named Mussawi to murder Nasir. Mussawi turns out to be an Iranian agent and has Barnes kidnapped and tortured. The Hezbollah leader ultimately arrives at the scene of Barnes' torture in time to stop Mussawi from beheading Barnes.
When the CIA learns that Mussawi plans to broadcast its intention to kill Nasir, the agency seeks to distance itself by scapegoating Barnes and portraying him as a rogue agent. Whiting becomes worried, first about Robert talking about the Nasir assassination plan, second that the coup that Nasir is organizing would have a greater likelihood of success, and thirdly that the assassination of Nasir by Predator drone would be evident as an American hit. Barnes obtains information on Whiting and makes a threat against him and his family unless Whiting ensures the release of Barnes' passports through his powerful political connections. Barnes eventually learns why he was portrayed as a rogue agent, and approaches Prince Nasir to warn him of the assassination plan. As he arrives, Nasir and his family are killed in the explosion. Woodman survives the blast and makes his way home to his wife and son.
Pakistani migrant workers Saleem Ahmed Khan (Shahid Ahmed) and his son Wasim (Mazhar Munir) board a bus to go to work at a Connex refinery, only to discover that they have been laid off due to a Chinese company outbidding Connex for the rights to run that facility. Since the company has provided food and lodging, the workers face the threat of poverty and deportation due to their unemployed status. Wasim desperately searches for work. Wasim and his friend join an Islamic school to learn Arabic in an effort to improve their employment prospects. While playing soccer, they meet a charismatic Islamic fundamentalist cleric (Amr Waked), who eventually leads them to execute a suicide attack on a Connex-Killen LNG tanker using a shaped-charge explosive from the missing Tehran missile.

[edit] Merger storyline
Bennett Holiday meets with U.S. Attorney Donald Farish III, who is convinced that Killen bribed someone to get the drilling rights in Kazakhstan. While investigating Connex-Killen's records, Holiday discovers a wire transfer of funds that is traced back to a transaction between Danny Dalton (Tim Blake Nelson) and Kazakhstani officials. Holiday tells Connex-Killen of his discovery, and they pretend not to have known about it. Holiday advises Dalton that he will likely be charged with corruption in order to serve as a "body" to get the DOJ off the back of the rest of Connex-Killen. Farish then strong-arms Holiday into giving the DOJ information about illegal activities he has discovered. Holiday gives up Dalton, but Farish says this is not enough. Holiday meets with ex-Killen chief Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper), and informs him that the DOJ needs a second body to drop the investigation. Pope asks Holiday whether a person at Holiday's firm, above him, would be sufficient as the additional body. Holiday acknowledges that if the name were big enough, the DOJ would stop the investigation, and allow the merger.
Holiday brings his colleague and mentor Sydney Hewitt (Nicky Henson) to meet with the CEO of Connex-Killen, Lee Janus (Peter Gerety). In a surprise move, Holiday reveals an under-the-table deal that Hewitt made while the Connex-Killen merger was being processed. Holiday has given Hewitt to the DOJ as the second body, thereby protecting the rest of Connex-Killen. Janus is able to attend the ceremony "oil industry man of the year" with a load taken off his shoulders. Throughout the film, Holiday has had to deal with his ailing, alcoholic and angry father Bennett Sr.; at the movie's end when the merger has been completed, Bennett Jr. wordlessly lets his apologetic-looking dad enter his house and shuts the door.

[edit] Production
The scene depicting Marbella (Spain), was filmed at the Royal Mirage hotel in Dubai, UAE. Numerous scenes were shot in Baltimore: those of Princeton University were shot on the campus of Loyola College in Maryland and others depicting the corporate offices of Connex were shot at the American Urological Association's world headquarters. Beirut and Tehran scenes were actually shot in Morocco.

[edit] Casting
Harrison Ford turned down the role of Robert Barnes (the role played by George Clooney), regretting it later, stating, "I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake".[1] This is the second Stephen Gaghan-written role Ford has declined, having turned down the role of Robert Wakefield in Traffic, a role that eventually went to Michael Douglas.[2]

[edit] Score
Main article: Syriana (soundtrack)

[edit] Title
The movie's title is suggested to derive from the hypothesized Pax Syriana, as an allusion to the necessary state of peace between Syria and the U.S. as it relates to the oil business. In a December 2005 interview, Baer told NPR that the title is a metaphor for foreign intervention in the Middle East, referring to post-World War II think tank strategic studies for the creation of an artificial state (such as Iraq, created from elements of the former Ottoman Empire) that would ensure continued western access to crude oil. The movie's website states that "‘Syriana’ is a very real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East."[3] Gaghan said he saw Syriana as "a great word that could stand for man's perpetual hope of remaking any geographic region to suit his own needs."[4]
The word Syriana derives from Syria + the Latin suffix -ana, a neuter plural form; it means, roughly, "things Syrian." Historically, Syria refers not to the state that since 1944 has borne the name, but to a more extensive land stretching from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the middle Euphrates River and the western edge of the desert steppe, and from the Tauric system of mountains in the north to the edge of the Sinai desert in the south. This land was part of the Fertile Crescent, and has historically been a geopolitically crucial junction for trade routes from the east, from Asia Minor and the Aegean, and from Egypt, and has long been a focus of great power conflicts. The word Syria does not appear in the Hebrew original of the Scriptures, but appears in the Septuagint as the translation of Aram. Herodotus speaks of "Syrians" as identical with Assyrians, but the term's geographical significance was not well defined in pre-Greek and Greek times. As an ethnic term, "Syrian" came to refer in Antiquity to Semitic peoples living outside Mesopotamian and Arabian areas. Greco-Roman administrations were the first to apply the term to a definite district.[5]

[edit] Reaction
Syriana was released on November 23, 2005 in limited release in only five theaters grossing $374,502 on its opening weekend. It went into wide release on December 9, 2005 in 1,752 theaters grossing $11.7 million on that weekend. It went to make $50.8 million in North America and $43.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $93.9 million.[6]

[edit] Critical reception
Syriana received generally very positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received 74% overall approval from critics, and a 87% from the "Cream of the Crop". The film also received a 76% ("Generally favorable reviews") on Metacritic. As a motion picture, the main criticism, even among reviewers who praised the film, was the confusion created by following numerous stories. Most critics stated that it was almost impossible to follow the plot, though some, notably Roger Ebert, praised precisely that quality of the film and offered an interesting hidden story possibility (a covert deal between the U.S. and China involving oil being shipped through Kazakhstan and passed off as coming from a different source).[7] The audience confusion mimics the confusion of the characters, who are enmeshed in the events around them without a clear understanding of what precisely is going on. As with Gaghan's screenplay for Traffic, Syriana uses multiple, parallel storylines, jumping from locations in Texas, Washington D.C., Switzerland, Spain, and the Middle East, leading film critic Ebert to describe the film as hyperlink cinema.[7]
Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "Gaghan relies on Clooney's agnostic heroism to lure viewers into his maze. When they get there, they will find not a conventionally satisfying movie but a kind of illustrated journalism: an engrossing, insider's tour of the world's hottest spots, grandest schemes and most dangerous men".[8] In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, "This is conspiracy-theory filmmaking of the most bravura kind, but if only a fraction of its suppositions are true, we — and the world — are in a world of trouble".[9] USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, "Gaghan assumes his audience is smart enough to follow his explosive tour of global petro-politics. The result is thought-provoking and unnerving, emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating".[10] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a "B-" rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, "it's also the kind of movie that requires a viewer to work actively for comprehension, and to chalk up any lack of same to his or her own deficiency in the face of something so evidently smart".[11]
In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, "If anything, Syriana tends to oversimplify a mind-bogglingly multifaceted problem that cannot so easily be resolved by a diatribe against the supposedly all-powerful 'Americans'".[12] Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers gave the film his highest rating and praised George Clooney's performance: "This is the best acting Clooney has ever done -- he's hypnotic, haunting and quietly devastating".[13] Philip French, in his review for The Observer, praised the film as "thoughtful, exciting and urgent".[14] In his review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, "But what complicates the plot is writer-director Stephen Gaghan's reluctance to criticise America too much. Instead of complexity, there is a blank, uncompelling tangle, which conceals a kind of complacent political correctness".[15]
Syriana has also been criticized for political reasons. Baer's book describes his attempts to assassinate Saddam Hussein, while in the movie the figure whom Clooney is to assassinate is a benevolent, liberal prince. (This may have been changed for authenticity, as the capture of Saddam Hussein took place two years before the movie's release.) Charles Krauthammer criticized the film for "anti-American" views and moral equivalence, stating that "Osama bin Laden could not have scripted this film with more conviction".[16] Fellow Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen called its portrayals of terrorists, the CIA, oil companies, and the U.S. government "crude clichés".[17]
Ebert named it the second best film of 2005, behind Crash. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone named it as the third best film of 2005.[18]

[edit] Awards
George Clooney won an Academy Award[19] and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor.[20] The actor was also nominated for a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor but failed to win.[21]
The National Board of Review named Syriana one of the best films of the year and Stephen Gaghan's screenplay as the Best Adapted Screenplay.[22]
