NIST Enterprise Architecture Model initiated in 1989, one of the earliest frameworks for Enterprise Architecture.[1]


An Enterprise Architecture Framework (EA Framework) is a framework for Enterprise Architecture, which defines, how to organize the structure and views associated with an Enterprise Architecture

[edit] Overview
Three Components of Enterprise Architecture framework are:[2]

Views : Provides the mechanisms for communicating information about the relationships that are important in your architecture
Methods : Provides the discipline to gather and organize the data and construct the views in a way that helps insure integrity, accuracy and completeness
Training/Experience : Supports the application of method and use of tools

Because the discipline of Enterprise engineering and Enterprise Architecture is so broad, and because enterprises can be large and complex, the models associated with the discipline also tend to be large and complex. To manage this scale and complexity, an Architecture Framework provides tools and methods that can bring the task into focus and allow valuable artifacts to be produced when they are most needed.
Architecture Frameworks are commonly used in Information technology and Information system governance. An organization may wish to mandate that certain models be produced before a system design can be approved. Similarly, they may wish to specify certain views be used in the documentation of procured systems - the U.S. Department of Defense stipulates that specific DoDAF views be provided by equipment suppliers for capital project above a certain value.

[edit] History




Impression of Enterprise Architecture Frameworks evolution (1987-2003).[2] This image is mention on the left: The Zachman Framework 1987, NIST Enterprise Architecture 1989, EAP 1992, TISAF 1997, FEAF 1999 and TEAF 2000. On the right: POSIX, TAFIM, JTA, JTAA, TOGAF 1995, DoD TRM and C4ISR 1996, and DoDAF 2003.


Enterprise Architecture started with the Zachman Framework in 1987. An other early implementation of an Enterprise Architecture framework was the "Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management" (TAFIM), which first draft was completed in 1991 with the TAFIM Technical Reference Model (TAFIM TRM). This technical reference model wanted to use open systems and new technologies available in the commercial market, to develope a DoD-wide application.[3] The TOGAF TRM was originally derived from the Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM), which in turn was derived from the IEEE model 1003.0[4] or POSIX Open System Environment: a standards to construct an information processing system, including consumers, system integrators, application developers, system providers, and procurement agencies.[5]
In recent years, it has become apparent that a key benefit to be gained from Enterprise architecture is the ability to support decision making in changing businesses. Because Enterprise Architecture brings together business models (e.g. process models, organizational charts, etc.) and technical models (e.g. systems architectures, data models, state diagrams, etc.) it is possible to trace the impact of organizational change on the systems, and also the business impact of changes to the systems.
As this benefit has emerged, many frameworks such as DoDAF, MODAF, or AGATE have adopted a standard meta model which defines the critical architectural elements and the dependencies between them. Applications based on these models can then query the underlying architectural information, providing a simple and strong mechanism for tracing strategies to organizational and technological impacts.

[edit] EA Framework topics

[edit] Framework of building codes




Artist impression.[6]


If you have ever remodeled your home, you know how important building codes, blueprints, and city or county inspections are to successfully complete the project. The architect operates within a "framework" of building codes, preparing blueprints for each phase of the project, from the structural changes to the size and layout of the rooms. Detailed drawings specify plumbing, electrical, and building construction information for the entire structure. Enterprise Architecture works in a similar manner.[6]
An architecture framework for Information Technology (IT) affects every aspect of the enterprise. An Enterprise Architecture framework is similar to building codes that ensure the building is soundly constructed. The IT governance bodies and procedures serve as the city and county inspectors for building improvement projects. Frameworks contain models and standards that will be used to develop IT architecture descriptions. The architecture description is the blueprint.[6]

[edit] Architecture domain




Example of the Federal Enterprise Architecture, which has defines five architectural layers.[7]


In the context of the creation of enterprise architecture it is common, according to Péter Bernus (2005)[8], to recognise three or four types of architecture, each corresponding to its particulair architecture domain. Examples of such domains are:

Business architecture,
Information systems architecture, often subdivided into

Data architecture, and
Application architecture,


and Technical architecture.

Architectural domains are a structuring criterion for a collection of architecture products. They should not be confused with the application domain of the framework as such.[8]

[edit] Layers of the Enterprise Architecture




Layers of the Enterprise Architecture. [9]


Contemporary federal guidance suggests thinking about “layers” of the enterprise architecture:[9]

Business processes and activities
Applications such as custom or off-the-shelf software tools
Data that must be collected, organized, safeguarded, and distributed
Technology such as computer system and telephone networks

The Architecture Domains follow a pattern of decomposition as one goes from top to the bottom of the framework. The ownership can be divided into 4 broad categories planner's view, Owner's view, Designer's View and Developer's view in this order. All the views are mostly hierarchical in nature. For business view the planner and owner's level is typically called the value chains (which are descriptive by nature. The designer's view of business is also known as the analytical view and there are various standards for modeling this view. One mostly commonly used modeling standard is BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The designer's view typically represents the execution level which uses standards like BPEL (Business Process Execution Language)
The Application and Technology Domains (which are not to be confused with business domains) are characterized by domain capabilities and domain services. The capabilities are supported by the services. The application services are also referred in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The technical services are typically supported by software products.
The data view starts with the data classes which can be decomposed into data subjects which can be further decomposed into data entities. The basic data model type which is most commonly used is called ERD (Entity Relationship Diagrams). The Class, subject and entity forms a hierarchical view of data. Enterprise do have millions of instances of data entities.

[edit] View model
A View model is a framework, which defines the set of views or approaches to be used in systems analysis or the constructinon a an enterprise architecture.
Since the early 1990’s there have been a number of efforts to define standard approaches for describing and analyzing system architectures. Many of the recent Enterprise Architecture frameworks have some kind of set of views defined, but these sets are not always called "view models".
