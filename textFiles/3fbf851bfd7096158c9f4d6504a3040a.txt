Look up virtualization in
Wiktionary, the free dictionary.


In computing, virtualization is a broad term that refers to the abstraction of computer resources:

Platform virtualization, which separates an operating system from the underlying platform resources[citation needed]

Full virtualization
Hardware-assisted virtualization
Partial virtualization
Paravirtualization
Operating system-level virtualization
Hosted environment[citation needed] (e.g. User-mode Linux)




Resource virtualization, the virtualization of specific system resources, such as storage volumes, name spaces, and network resources

Encapsulation, the hiding of resource complexity by the creation of a simplified interface
Virtual memory, which allows uniform, contiguous addressing of physically separate and non-contiguous memory and disk areas
Storage virtualization, the process of completely abstracting logical storage from physical storage

RAID - redundant array of independent disks
Disk partitioning, is the splitting of a single resource (usually large), such as disk space or network bandwidth, into a number of smaller, more easily utilized resources of the same type
Logical volume management, which combines many disks into one large pool and then divides it into logical disks.


Network virtualization, creation of a virtualized network addressing space within or across network subnets
Channel bonding, the use multiple links combined to work as though they offered a single, higher-bandwidth link
I/O virtualization e.g. vNICs, vHBAs
Memory virtualization Aggregates RAM resources from networked systems into virtualized memory pool


Computer clusters and grid computing, the combination of multiple discrete computers into larger metacomputers


Application virtualization, the hosting of individual applications on alien hardware/software

Portable application
Cross-platform virtualization
Emulation or simulation
Hosted Virtual Desktop


Virtualization Development, further work in this area


Desktop virtualization, the remote manipulation of a computer desktop

Virtualization can also refer to:

a fictional use of this term, in Scanners (Code Lyoko)
different types of human body and mind virtualization: Human Virtualization




This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.


Physicalization is the converse approach to virtualized data centers, where, instead of allocating workloads across subdivided, single machine, virtualized resources, the hardware is organized as replicated sets of simple atomic compute resources that are not virtualized. External control software dispatches workloads to these individual atomic compute nodes in much the same way as a VMM manages workload placement in a virtualized system.
