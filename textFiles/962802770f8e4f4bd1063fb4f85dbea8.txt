For the mobile telephone operating system, see Openmoko Linux.
Openmoko is a project which encompasses two related sub-projects, with the combined aim of creating a family of open source mobile phones.[1] The project was founded by FIC.
The first sub-project is Openmoko Linux, a Linux-based operating system designed for mobile phones, built using free software.
The second sub-project is the development of hardware devices on which Openmoko Linux runs. The first device released was the Neo 1973,[2][3] which was followed up by the Neo FreeRunner on 25 June 2008.[4] Unlike most other mobile phone platforms, these phones are designed to provide end users with the ability to modify the operating system and software stack. Other Openmoko-supported phones are also available.
On 2009-04-02 Openmoko canceled planned phones and will probably concentrate on other kinds of hardware.[5]

[edit] Openmoko Linux
Main article: Openmoko Linux
Openmoko Linux is the software subproject of Openmoko. It uses the Linux kernel, together with a graphical user environment built using the X.Org Server, GTK+ toolkit, and the Matchbox window manager. The 2008 April Software Update (ASU) has added support for the Qt toolkit and Enlightenment 17. The OpenEmbedded build framework and ipkg package system (currently being replaced by the newer opkg package system) are used to create and maintain software packages.
Native applications can be developed and compiled using various languages including C and C++.[6]
Initial versions of the software are developed for the hardware developed by the Openmoko project (Neo 1973 and Neo FreeRunner devices from FIC). There has been moderate effort as yet in using the OS on other hardware platforms.
There are also some derivatives of Openmoko Linux main distribution SHR and Fat and Dirty Openmoko(FDOM).

Neo FreeRunner


FIC is releasing hardware platforms that run the Openmoko software stack natively although, one of Openmoko's goals being openness, it does not discourage the use of other operating systems on the Openmoko hardware platform. Openmoko hardware aspires to the term open source hardware although in various areas the availability of cell phone components and law requirements prevent full conformance to this term.
As many other vendors, FIC notoriously failed to meet the publicly announced hardware release dates moving them further into the future multiple times.
The first supported phone, the Neo 1973 GTA01 (version: Bv4), was distributed exclusively through openmoko.com from July 2007 to February 2008.
The second revision of hardware based on the GTA01 design is the Dash Express, an automotive navigation system. The Dash Express has a faster CPU (Samsung 2440) and Wi-Fi ability.
The third hardware platform, the Neo FreeRunner codenamed GTA02 is an improved version of the Neo 1973. At least two further models are currently planned or developed in the GTA phone series.

[edit] Neo 1973
Main article: Neo 1973
The Neo 1973 (codenamed GTA01) phone was a "developers only" release. This phone supports the 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz GSM frequency bands. It can run the Qtopia user interface in addition to the Openmoko developed GTK+ stack. Many Linux and unix programs used on desktop and server platforms, including utilities and games, have been successfully run on the phone. In addition to Linux, the NetBSD, FreeBSD and L4 kernels have been adapted by users to run on the platform or are under development. The bootloader used to start the operating system kernel is U-boot and allows the various maintenance tasks such as software updates to be performed.
This hardware platform can be emulated in software with a high level of compatibility using a version of Qemu included in the Openmoko software suite.

[edit] Neo FreeRunner
Main article: Neo FreeRunner
On 4 January 2008 Openmoko issued a press release naming the revision of the Neo 1973 the Neo FreeRunner (codenamed GTA02). The changes include a faster processor (clocked at 400 MHz), 802.11b/g Wi-Fi, two accelerometers and 3D graphics acceleration. FreeRunner ships to selected developers as early test devices since Q1 2008.
On 9 April 2008 a community update announced the price for FreeRunner, 399 USD (with small changes due to taxes in different locations). The device's debug board will be sold separately at $99. It was released for the mass market on the 25th of June 2008.[4]

[edit] Dash Express
Main article: Dash Express
On 2 January 2008 the Dash Express, a GPS device, with hardware developed by FIC was announced running Openmoko Linux.[7] This device, initially codenamed the HXD8, seems to use little or none of the openmoko user-interface, simply using patches to the kernel developed by Openmoko Inc, and running an application from Dash Navigation on it to provide navigation and user interface.

[edit] Canceled devices
The next phone, GTA03[8], would be based on newer and more powerful system-on-a-chip. It would presumably differ from the Neo FreeRunner by having a 3.5 mm TRS audio connector (instead of a 2.5 mm connector), EDGE and a camera.[9][10][11] GTA03 would not include support for 3G networks.[12]
The fourth Openmoko planned, GTA04, would be based on a different system-on-a-chip. It would have had 3G support.[13]

[edit] History
Openmoko was announced in 2006 by its founders First International Computer (FIC).[14]
The Initial core team for Openmoko project included:

Sean Moss-Pultz
Harald Welte
Michael Lauer
Werner Almesberger


[edit] Etymology
The name Openmoko can be seen as an initialism for Open Mobile Communications. The company was named OpenMoko until early 2008 when it was renamed Openmoko.
The codename for the phone product series, GTA, is an abbreviation of "GSM-TI-AGPS" which indicates the main components of the phone[15]
