[edit] Membership
Basic IMVU memberships are free. Free memberships allow users to register an avatar name, make use of the chat service, purchase virtual content and create homepage. Free accounts are denoted in-game by the prefix 'Guest_'. Paying for membership enables additional options, some of which require further payment, such as access to restricted material.

[edit] Content creation program
The content creation program, previously known as the developer program, allows members to create their own in-game items in the 3D software application 3ds Max, and export them into the IMVU Previewer. These custom made items can be sold for credits, at the cost of initial and sale fees.

[edit] In-game economy
IMVU runs an in-game economy using two types of currency: IMVU 'credits' and 'promotional credits'. A third form of currency also exists for members who sell custom made items - 'developer tokens'. Credits must be purchased online using actual currency, either directly from IMVU or from third party resellers. Credits may also be transferred back to IMVU for actual currency. Members use credits in-game, to buy virtual items that are applicable either to their avatar or to scenes or rooms.
Promotional credits, abbreviated to 'promo-credits' are a second form of currency that is produced to members by IMVU at no outside cost. With relation to a standard free or full member, promo-credits are similar to standard credits. A given number of credits equates to the same number of promo-credits. However, promo-credits cannot be used to purchase items as gifts for other members, and may not be traded back to IMVU for actual currency.
IMVU allows full members to participate in a 'Content Creator Program'. This allows IMVU provided software utilities to create virtual in-game items, and can sell their products by listing them in an online product catalog. Content creators earn credits when their items are sold and are allowed to resell the credits they earn, though they cannot be resold to IMVU itself. Developer tokens only appear in the instance that a member pays a developer for a custom item, using promo-credits instead of standard credits. Once received by the content creator, promo-credits automatically translate into developer tokens. One developer token is technically worth ten credits, however, developer tokens may only be spent on developer related fees, such as the initial cost that must be paid when putting an item on sale.[3]

[edit] Community
Many IMVU users are content creators, creating and selling products in the IMVU catalog. Users also devote time to customizing their individual homepages, setting up public and private rooms, and creating and participating in user Groups (similar to forums but personalised via the owner). Additionally, as with most online communities, there are numerous user produced third-party websites providing additional forums and resources to the IMVU community.

[edit] IMVU Music Store
In Autumn 2008, IMVU launched the IMVU Music Store, which sells music for streaming within IMVU users' public and private rooms as well as in mp3 format. The store includes music from both major and independent labels and is based on the library of music provided by digital music site GroupieTunes.
On December 21, 2008, independent artist Lady Wallace' song "Lady Wallace Sings" topped the IMVU Music Store charts, selling more than major artists, despite being available in the store for less than one week.[4][unreliable source?] Previously, Lady Wallace had released a machinima music video for the song, filmed almost entirely in the virtual world of IMVU, in which the singer appears as her 3d avatar whose movements are based on motion capture of actual footage of the real life singer.[5][unreliable source?]
