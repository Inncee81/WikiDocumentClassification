[edit] Operation
JkDefrag has a wide range of options. If it is run without options it optimizes speed by classifying files into 3 zones:

Directories and system files (zone 1);
Regular files (zone 2); and
Large files referred to as "space hogs" in the documentation (zone 3).

Files outside their zone are moved to their zone. Directories are perhaps the most accessed data on disk, so zone 1 is placed at the beginning of the drive. After the directories comes a free space area, then zone 2 with regular files, another free area, and then zone 3 with "space hogs", which are large files, archives, recycle bin contents, service pack files, and other infrequently accessed data.[2]
JkDefrag has several excellent characteristics:

Low overhead: it does not place an undue burden on the system;
Fully automated operation: there are no interactive buttons or menus;
Options aren't necessary, but a wide range can be selected using the Command line interface, allowing full control for scheduled defragmentation and with administrator scripts;
No need for installation; runs with default options by merely opening JkDefrag.exe;
Screensaver defragmentation, with the option to run another screen saver when done;
Complete source code (Microsoft Visual C++ 2005) available for download;
A DLL library (for use in programming) licensed using the LGPL; and
Support for 64 bit versions of Windows XP and Vista;
Excellent documentation available on the web site.;
Two versions: Both the GUI version and the character-oriented version have numerous command line options.

JkDefrag runs on the Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista Operating Systems, and defragments both FAT and NTFS filesystems. It uses the standard Windows defragmentation API exclusively; it is entirely safe. User support is provided through web-based forums.

[edit] Related software
There are several graphical user interface utilities designed to work with JkDefrag.

JKDefrag Option GUI by Emiel Wieldraaijer includes support for 26 languages, and has additional support for BartPE and U3 implementations.[3] It was also nominated "Repair Tool of the Week" in TechNibble in August 2007.[4]
JkDefragGUI by Markus Hörl is portable, includes support for 10(+30) languages, and there is a setup version.
ScanDefrag supports JkDefrag and allows it to run early on during Windows startup.

For a list of other defragmentation software products, see list of defragmentation software. The only other Windows-based defrag program with a GNU GPL is UltraDefrag.
