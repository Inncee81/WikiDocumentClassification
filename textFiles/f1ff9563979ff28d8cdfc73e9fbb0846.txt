A bliki (also known as a wikiLog, wog, wikiWeblog, wikiblog, or bloki), is combination of the two Internet concepts of a blog and wiki. It combines features from both: as with blogs, posts or articles appear in reverse chronological order on the front page, with the most recent one at the top; but editing is done in wiki style, with a version history for each page and special markup tags. As with wikis, the fact that a site is a bliki does not mean that any reader can edit any page; editing permission is at the discretion of the administrator(s).
According to software expert (and bliki enthusiast) Martin Fowler, the name and concept were conceived in 2003 by wiki originator Ward Cunningham.[1]
