[edit] Details and motivation
PyPy was conceived as an implementation of Python written in Python, which enables Python developers to hack the implementation. This makes it easy to identify areas where it can be improved. PyPy is also more flexible and easier to experiment with than CPython, thus allowing developers to experiment with multiple implementations of specific features.
PyPy aims to provide a common translation and support framework for producing implementations of dynamic languages, emphasising a clean separation between language specification and implementation aspects. It also aims to provide a compliant, flexible and fast implementation of the Python programming language using the above framework to enable new advanced features without having to encode low level details into it.[1]

[edit] Translation
PyPy consists of the standard interpreter and a translator. The interpreter is written in a restricted subset of the Python language, called RPython (Restricted Python). Unlike standard Python, RPython can be statically compiled. The translator is a tool chain that analyzes RPython code and translates it to a lower-level language, such as C, LLVM or Common Intermediate Language.

[edit] Project status
PyPy is a followup to the Psyco project, a just-in-time specializing compiler for Python, developed by Armin Rigo. PyPy's aim is to have a just-in-time specializing compiler with scope which was not available for Psyco.
PyPy began as a research and development-oriented project. But after reaching a mature state of development and an official 1.0 release in mid-2007, its current focus is on releasing a production-ready version with more CPython compatibility some time in early 2009.[2] As of June 2008, PyPy is able to run some popular python libraries like Pylons[3], Pyglet[4] and Divmod's Nevow.[5]
PyPy was funded by the European Union as a STReP[6] between December 2004 and March 2007. In June 2008, PyPy announced funding as part of the Google Open Source programs, and has agreed to focus on making PyPy more compatible with CPython.
