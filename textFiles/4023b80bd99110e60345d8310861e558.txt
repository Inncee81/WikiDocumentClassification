Uwe Boll (pronounced [ˈuːvə bɔl]), (born June 22, 1965 in Wermelskirchen, Germany) is a director, producer and screenwriter of films often adapted from video games. Unlike most directors in the United States who receive funding from Hollywood studios, he finances his own films through his Boll KG production company. Boll studied at the University of Cologne and the University of Siegen, and holds a doctorate in literature.[1]

[edit] Films
Boll's first two major releases were the horror movie Blackwoods and the drama Heart of America, both of which he directed and co-wrote.
Boll is best known for adapting video games into movies, having directed and produced a number of such adaptations, including House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Alone in the Dark II, BloodRayne, BloodRayne II: Deliverance, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, Postal and now the latest film Far Cry, which upset a lot of Far Cry gaming fans.[citation needed] Boll intends to produce a third movie based on the BloodRayne franchise.[2] Boll also made a bid to direct the upcoming World of Warcraft movie, but was turned away by the owners of the Warcraft franchise, Blizzard.[3]
For the opening credits footage to Seed (2007), Boll uses footage of animal abuse and torture he received from PETA to underscore the film's nihilism. He has also promised to donate 2.5 percent of his net profits from Seed to PETA.[4]
Boll is currently trying to get funding to make a Guitar Hero movie. According to Boll, "This movie will be about the biggest guitar heros in the world, and how they enter the videogame and compete in the biggest contest in the world, to become the ultimate guitar hero, and to save the world."

[edit] Financing
Boll continues to find investors who wish to acquire the rights for future video-game-to-movie adaptations. His investors are mostly German. He acquires the rights for potential future adaptations and personally oversees preproduction work, filming, and post-production.
Movies directed by Boll have performed poorly at the box office in the United States. House of the Dead (budget: $12 million) broke $5.73 million on opening weekend,[5] Alone in the Dark (budget: $20 million) made over $5.1 million,[6] and BloodRayne (budget: $25 million) topped $2.42 million.[7] But by far the worst commercial performance of his career was In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, which made barely $10 million worldwide at the box office on a $60 million budget.
Boll is able to acquire funding thanks to German tax laws that reward investments in film. The law allows investors in German-owned films to write off 100% of their investment as a tax deduction; it also allows them to invest borrowed money and write off any fees associated with the loan. The investor is then only required to pay taxes on the profits made by the movie; if the movie loses money, the investor gets a tax writeoff.
In the DVD commentary of Alone in the Dark, Boll explains how he funds his films:

"Maybe you know it but it's not so easy to finance movies in total. And the reason I am able to do these kind of movies is I have a tax shelter fund in Germany, and if you invest in a movie in Germany you get basically fifty percent back from the Government."

While Boll has received a lot of negative publicity regarding this funding method,[8] he was actually one of the few directors to use the tax shelter as intended. His films were financed, produced, and directed by a German company, which was the initial intention behind the tax shelter: to provide incentive for investment in German entertainment properties.

[edit] Criticism
Many of Boll's movies, especially those based on video games, have been critically panned. Those that are based on video games are usually only loosely based on the game in question. As of February 1, 2009, five of his films, including Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead, appear on the Internet Movie Database's Bottom 100 films list, although BloodRayne II: Deliverance has disappeared from the listing.[9] In a review of Alone in the Dark, Rob Vaux states that the movie makes other "bad" movie directors feel better in comparison: "'It's okay,' they'll tell themselves, 'I didn't make Alone in the Dark.'"[10] Another reviewer wrote that Alone in the Dark was "so poorly built, so horribly acted and so sloppily stitched together that it's not even at the straight-to-DVD level."[11]
When rumors surfaced that Boll had expressed interest in a Metal Gear Solid movie, and claimed to have been given a script to read, Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima responded in his audioblog HIDECHAN, "Absolutely not! I don't know why Uwe Boll is even talking about this kind of thing. We've never talked to him. It's impossible that we'd ever do a movie with him."[12] Boll later stated that he only thought he was doing the film because he was tricked by two con artists who claimed to work for Konami.[13]
On August 19, 2005, the Canadian-based comedy website Loading Ready Run released a video entitled, "PSA: Uwe Boll", in which the site's co-founder, Graham Stark, gave a mock public service announcement criticizing Uwe Boll's work. On March 31, 2006, the site released a similar video entitled, "Uwe Boll: An Apology". In this video, the site had been contacted by Uwe Boll's lawyers and forced to make a public apology for the statements made in "PSA: Uwe Boll". In response, the site's other co-founder, Paul Sanders, gave a mock public service announcement which appeared to support Uwe Boll's work, but was covertly still making fun of it.
Blair Erickson, a writer of a treatment for Alone in the Dark, has written a critical account of his experience working with Boll, in which Erickson alleges that Boll stole ideas from prior movies and wanted to add elements to the story that were not true to the tone of the source material. Uwe chose to not use Erickson's script, citing reasons such as it having "not enough car chases."[14]
Boll blames the poor commercial performance of his video game adaptations on his distribution company, Romar, and has filed a lawsuit against them.[15] Boll's films prior to the release of House of the Dead received better reception. The New York Times, for instance, gave Blackwoods a positive review, although overall reactions to the film have been negative.[16]
Blizzard Entertainment refused Boll's request to make a World of Warcraft adaptation; Boll said, "I got in contact with Paul Sams of Blizzard, and he said, 'We will not sell the movie rights, not to you... especially not to you.'"[17]
On X-Play's "Gphoria" awards show, one of the categories was "Game Most Deserving of a Uwe Boll Adaptation." The games nominated in this category were the ones most disliked by the critics at X-Play.
Boll received a rare "Worst Career Achievement" award at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards on February 21, 2009 for In The Name of the King, 1968: Tunnel Rats, and Postal.[18] Boll has been nominated for Razzies three times in total.

[edit] Response to criticism
Boll does not shy away from his critics. In the Alone in the Dark DVD commentary, he responds to criticism that his adaptations make significant changes to the plot and style of the source material: "Fans are always totally flipping out and I understand that the fan of a video game has his own agenda in his head and has his ideas about what is a good movie and what is a bad movie." Referring to House of the Dead, Boll said: "I think I made a perfect House of the Dead movie, because it really shows how the game is. It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action."[19] Boll is especially critical of his internet detractors. Referring to two Ain't It Cool News critics who negatively reviewed his work, Boll said, "Harry (Knowles) and Quint (Eric Vespe) are retards."[20]
Boll also criticizes the game companies themselves for providing zero support once the movie license is sold. He cites the cross-promotion and support which comic-book-based properties adapted for the screen receive, whereas video game companies often "sell off the license and then forget about it."[19] He argues that this is the reason video game adaptations are not well received by critics and audiences.
When Wired published a negative review of Postal, Boll responded with an e-mail claiming that the critic "(didn't) understand anything about movies and that you are a untalented wanna bee filmmaker with no balls and no understanding what POSTAL is. you dont [sic] see courage because you are nothing. and no go to your mum and hurt her ...because she cooks for you now since 30 years ..so she deserves it".[21] Boll claims that this angry email was sparked not by the review, but because the Wired editor told Boll in person that the editor loved the movie then published a negative review.[22]

[edit] Critic boxing matches (Raging Boll)



This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.


Boll made headlines by challenging his critics to "put up or shut up". In June 2006, his production company issued a press release stating that Boll would challenge his five harshest critics each to a 10 round boxing match. Invitations were also open to film directors Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary. To qualify, critics had to have written two extremely negative reviews of Boll, in print or on the Web, in 2005. Footage from the fights were to be included on the DVD of his upcoming film Postal.[23] On June 20, 2006, Rich "Lowtax" Kyanka stated on Something Awful that he had been invited by Boll to be the first contestant. Only after that did Kyanka review Alone in the Dark.[24] The online gambling site GoldenPalace.com decided to sponsor this event, dubbing it "Raging Boll". The list of five critics to step into the ring with Boll was drawn up in late August 2006, and featured Kyanka, Rue Morgue magazine writer Chris Alexander, webmaster of Cinecutre Carlos Palencia Jimenez-Arguello, Ain't it Cool News writer Jeff Sneider and Chance Minter, amateur boxer and website critic.[25][26] Boll fought and won against all five participants. The first took place on September 5, 2006 in Málaga, Spain against Carlos Palencia[27] with the rest on September 23, 2006 at the Plaza of Nations in Vancouver.[28]
After Kyanka lost his match, he would go on to make several allegations against Boll, including that Boll refused to fight against Chance Minter, an amateur boxer, because he was an experienced boxer (However, Boll actually fought Minter as his fourth opponent.) ;[29] that Boll misled them by claiming it was a PR stunt, but actually intended to fight them; that Boll claimed the participants would get training before the match, which no one did; and that Boll had seriously wounded Sneider, who had also believed Boll.[30]
Kyanka added in a post-match interview that, "Half of us (the contenders) hadn't even seen his movies."[31] Sneider shared similar sentiments, stating "I think he's a jerk. This might be PR but I don't want to keep getting punched in the head."[32] Boll has denied these claims in an interview, stating that he gave his opponents three months to prepare. He also denied ever saying it was a PR stunt and claims that it was going to be a real fight.[33]
Other contestants responded less negatively. Alexander, in a Toronto Star article, recounts being invited to Boll's beach house on the following day, where Boll asked him about the reasons for his unilaterally negative reviews. Alexander bluntly told Boll that his movies were "bloated, expensive and incoherent attempts at aping American genre pictures and sport some of the most boneheaded casting choices in filmdom" but that Boll was an "insane, two-fisted rogue, and a shockingly HONEST one at that, someone who absolutely adores film, knows its history and truly lives for what he does."[34]
Alexander referred to the event as "the weirdest pop culture bizarre journalism stunt I've ever been involved in."[32] Minter also praised what he had seen so far of Boll's upcoming production Seed.[35] Boll praised the contestants in a post fight press conference, stating "I like now the critics... Everybody who was in the ring showed (guts). Nobody dived."[32]
Ron Sparks offered to fight Boll in Vancouver as part of the Postal publicity stunt, but Boll declined, citing Sparks's age and size advantage. Sparks himself defended Boll's decision in his MySpace blog, however, saying that because Boll was fighting several boxers back to back, and putting them in his movie, he had the right to choose any opponents willing to fight him.
Also, printed in Electronic Gaming Monthly's November 2006 edition of the section "The Rest of the Crap", written by critic Seanbaby, described Seanbaby's own involvement. Apparently Uwe was going to appear on G4's Attack of the Show! and promote this fight by sparring with one of the hosts. He claims that, "Again, he's [Uwe Boll] a matchmaking genius, because everyone on TV's 3-feet tall. If you were watching [AotS] during the time I co-hosted, you might have noticed that I could have leaned over and eaten host Kevin Pereira." A producer of the show then asked if Seanbaby would come and spar in the host's place for the event. Seanbaby says that he trains in Muay Thai and jujutsu, and that, "Boxing is to Fighting what Hungry Hungry Hippos is to fighting..." When Uwe heard of this, he wanted to know Seanbaby's age, height, weight and fighting experience since he "learned he wasn't fighting a midget". After receiving said information, Boll chose not to appear on the program.

[edit] Petition to resign
In April 2008, The Guardian ran an article claiming Boll had promised to retire if an online petition at PetitionOnline.com asking him to do so received 1,000,000 signatures.[36]
On May 7, 2008, the makers of Stride gum announced they would give each signer a digital coupon for a pack of gum if the petition obtained the required 1 million signatures by May 14, 2008.[37]
As of 2009[update], there are 330,000 signatures.[38][39]

[edit] Rejoinder
Uwe Boll has released a video stating that he is "the only genius in the whole fucking [movie] business" and that other directors such as Michael Bay and Eli Roth are "fucking retards". He promised that his upcoming film Postal will be "way better than all that social-critic George Clooney bullshit that you get every fucking weekend." In response to an "Anti-Uwe Boll" online petition, Boll has also expressed hopes that somebody will start a Pro-Uwe Boll petition, which he would expect to hit a million signatures.[40]
Bay responded to the "fucking retards" comment by calling Boll "a sad being" and stated that he didn't care "in the slightest" about the remark[41] while Roth facetiously said Boll's comments were the "greatest compliment ever."[42] Boll later noted that the comments were meant to be a generic picture over Hollywood, and that he has nothing against the people mentioned.[43]
Boll then appeared on Thursday, April 10's episode of G4's Attack of the Show, where he was interviewed regarding his controversial online retort. In the interview, he said (in regard to Michael Bay and Eli Roth responding to his criticisms) that Roth "has a sense of humor" and that Bay "has no sense of humor." He also jokingly stated that he believes that his upcoming adaptation of Postal (from the video game of the same name) could beat Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull at the box office.
On April 27, 2008, Boll responded to Bay's "not caring about Boll" comment. "To prove who is the better director", Boll offered to challenge Bay to a boxing match at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. If Bay accepted, the match would last for 12 rounds and will take place in September.[44] In response to Boll's comments, Bay again posted a statement this time saying:

"I never even heard his name till last week when he made threats and rants. The guy is a stupid idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, says he has a doctorate—but uses the word 'retard' in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, what is interesting are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make Youtube lame quality anger rants. Guy just want attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house."[45]

[edit] Upcoming projects
Boll is working on two new arthouse films, Stoic and Janjaweed.[46] Unlike some of his most well known films they will not be based on video games. He will also direct The Storm.
Boll is planning his first German language film in 14 years, about Max Schmeling, to be shot in the summer of 2009.[47] It is a movie about the real life boxer who was abandoned by the German authorities during World War 2, and then acquired the Coca Cola licence for Germany.
Uwe Boll's website now offers the opportunity for anyone to "co-produce" his upcoming film Blackout. In exchange for a gift of 33 euros ($49 US), a donor will receive a limited edition DVD of the film and a signed certificate from the cast and crew.[48]

[edit] Writings
Boll has written two books, Wie man in Deutschland einen Film drehen muss (How a Movie Has to be Made in Germany) and Die Gattung Serie und ihre Genres (Genus Series and its Genres), on themes of serial television.

Many now beleave this video is just another cheap publicity stunt on Boll's half to promote his own movie by lying about a match that will never take place.
