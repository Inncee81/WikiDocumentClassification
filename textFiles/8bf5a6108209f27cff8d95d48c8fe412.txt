A hedgehog.


The hedgehog's dilemma, or sometimes the porcupine dilemma, is an analogy about the challenges of human intimacy. It describes a situation in which a group of hedgehogs all seek to become close to one another in order to share their heat during cold weather. However, once accomplished, they cannot avoid hurting one another with their sharp quills. They must step away from one another. Though they all share the intention of a close reciprocal relationship, this may not occur for reasons which they cannot avoid.
Both Schopenhauer and Freud have used this situation to describe what they feel is the state an individual will find themselves in relation to others. The hedgehog's dilemma suggests that despite goodwill, human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm, and what results is cautious behavior and weak relationships. With the hedgehog's dilemma one is recommended to use moderation in the affairs with others both because it is in self-interest, and also out of consideration for others. The hedgehog's dilemma is used to justify or explain introversion and isolationism.
It is also important to note that hedgehogs do not actually hurt each other when they get close to one another (unless they want to, i.e. fighting), as when they are relaxed they will lay their quills down completely flat. Actually, when living in groups, hedgehogs often sleep close to each other.[citation needed]

[edit] Schopenhauer
The concept originates from German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's Parerga und Paralipomena, Volume II, Chapter XXXI, Section 396.[1] In his English translation, E.F.J. Payne translates the German "Stachelschweine" as "porcupines". Schopenhauer's parable describes a number of hedgehogs who need to huddle together for warmth and who struggle to find the optimal distance where they may feel sufficiently warm without hurting one another. The hedgehogs have to sacrifice warmth for comfort. The conclusion that Schopenhauer draws, is that if someone has enough internal warmth, he or she can avoid society and the giving and receiving of psychological discomfort that results from social interaction.

[edit] Freud
It entered the realm of psychology after the tale was discovered and adopted by Sigmund Freud. Schopenhauer’s tale was quoted by Freud in a footnote to his 1921 essay Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego. It is believed that part of what prompted his trip to America was his desire to catch sight of a wild porcupine, with which he was fascinated.[2]

[edit] Cultural references
It is a common theme in pop culture and literature and also often a trait possessed by an anti-hero.
The hedgehog's dilemma appears as a Neon Genesis Evangelion episode Hedgehog's Dilemma, and as a defining trait of series protagonist Shinji Ikari. A reference is also made in the 1999 film, The Thomas Crown Affair, when Thomas Crown asks his psychiatrist "How do porcupines make love?"
The hedgehog's dilemma was the subject of a question in the 26 January 2009 episode of the BBC quiz show University Challenge. The same episode was notable for featuring the lowest score achieved by any team since the programme's new format began in 1994.
