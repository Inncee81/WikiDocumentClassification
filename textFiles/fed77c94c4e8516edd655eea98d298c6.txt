100 Greatest Britons was broadcast in 2002 by the BBC. The programme was the result of a vote conducted to determine whom the United Kingdom public considers the greatest British people have been in history.
The poll resulted in some unlikely (if not controversial) candidates including Guy Fawkes, who was executed for trying to blow up the Parliament of England; King Richard III, suspected of murdering his nephews; James Connolly, an Irish nationalist and socialist who was executed by the Crown in 1916; and a surprisingly high ranking for former Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em star Michael Crawford in 17th. In addition to the British natives, some notable non-British entrants were listed as well. These include two Irish nationals, (philanthropic musicians Bono and Bob Geldof); former Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, who was born (to British Indian Parsi parents) in Zanzibar when it was a British colony; and both Alfred the Great and Boudica are from an era where "Britishness" was a concept of the future.
The top 19 entries were exclusively of self-declared English origin (though Sir Ernest Shackleton and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, were both born into English families settled in Ireland when that country was still part of the UK). The highest-placed Scottish entry was Alexander Fleming in 20th place, with the highest Welsh entry, Owain Glyndŵr, at number 23. None were from Northern Ireland. 60 had lived in the twentieth century.
The resulting series, Great Britons, included individual programmes on the top ten, with viewers having further opportunities to vote after each programme. It concluded with a debate. All of the top 10 were deceased by the year of broadcast. The highest-ranked living person was Margaret Thatcher, who placed 16th.

Several of these also appear in Channel 4's list of 100 Worst Britons (a tongue in cheek response to this show), due to strongly polarised views on their works, lives or legacies - notably this includes Margaret Thatcher and the current monarch, Elizabeth II. Channel 4 refused to take votes for dead figures, with their broadcast considerably lighter in tone.
1There was some question as to whether the Richard Burton listed is the actor or the explorer. A BBC press release makes it clear that the Burton so honoured is in fact the actor.

[edit] Series
An hour long documentary was filmed on each of the top ten nominees, each of them hosted by a celebrity advocate, who delivered a passionate argument as to why their choice should be voted the greatest Briton of all. The series concluded with a debate on the merits of each selected Briton, bringing all of the advocates together to make a final plea to voters.
