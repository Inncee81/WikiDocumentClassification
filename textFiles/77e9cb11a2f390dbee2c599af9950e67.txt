From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The musical works of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) are listed below. Two different, overlapping lists of Beethoven's works are presented here. The first is a listing of his most well-known works classified by genre. The second is a larger list of works, classified by various numbering systems. Years in parentheses denote dates of composition or publication.
The most common methods of numbering Beethoven's works are by the Opus number, which was assigned by Beethoven's publishers during his lifetime, and by number within genre. For example, the 14th published string quartet, which was published as Opus 131, may be referenced either as "String Quartet No. 14" or "the Opus 131 String Quartet".
Many works that were unpublished have been assigned either "WoO" or "Anh" numbers. For example, the short piano piece "Für Elise", is more fully known as the "Bagatelle in A minor, WoO 59 ('Für Elise')". Some works also have nicknames, like the 'Kreutzer' Sonata for violin, or the Eroica Symphony.
The listings that follow include all of these relevant identifiers so that the works may be correctly identified in each place where a work appears. Other catalogues of Beethoven's works exist; the numbers presented here are the most widely known.

[edit] List of works by genre




Beethoven, caricatured by J. P. Lyser



[edit] Orchestral music
Throughout his lifetime, Beethoven wrote nine symphonies, nine concertos, and a variety of other orchestral music, ranging from overtures and incidental music for theatrical productions to other miscellaneous "occasional" works, written for a particular occasion. Of the concertos, seven are widely known (one violin concerto, five piano concertos, and one triple concerto for violin, piano, and cello); the other two are an unpublished early piano concerto (WoO 4) and an arrangement of the Violin Concerto for piano and orchestra (Opus 61a).

[edit] Symphonies

Opus 21: Symphony No. 1 in C major (composed 1799–1800, premièred 1800)
Opus 36: Symphony No. 2 in D major (composed 1801–02, premièred 1803)
Opus 55: Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major ("Eroica") (composed 1803, premièred 1804)
Opus 60: Symphony No. 4 in B-flat major (composed 1806, premièred 1807)
Opus 67: Symphony No. 5 in C minor (composed 1805–08, premièred 1808)
Opus 68: Symphony No. 6 in F major ("Pastoral") (composed 1805–08, premièred 1808)
Opus 92: Symphony No. 7 in A major (composed 1811–12, premièred 1813)
Opus 93: Symphony No. 8 in F major (composed 1811–12, premièred 1814)
Opus 125: Symphony No. 9 in D minor ("Choral") (composed 1817–24, premièred 1824)

What was once believed by some to be an early symphony by Beethoven, the "Jena" Symphony in C major is now thought to be by Friedrich Witt.[1]
Beethoven is believed to have intended to write a Tenth Symphony in the last year of his life; a performing version of possible sketches was assembled by Barry Cooper.[2]
