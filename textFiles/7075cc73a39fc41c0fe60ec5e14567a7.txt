Nintendogs (ニンテンドッグス ?) is a real-time pet simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. As of 2009, in all versions combined, it had sold 21.67 million copies making it the best selling standalone game[1] . It was originally released in three different versions - Dachshund & Friends, Lab & Friends, and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been re-released twice since then - first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian and Friends.
Nintendogs utilizes the Nintendo DS' touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet his or her dog, and also allows for him or her to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog commands such as "sit" or "roll over". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS' wireless link-up. It also uses the DS' internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time.
Nintendogs received mostly positive critical reception. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings,[2], and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of September 30, 2008, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 20.03 million copies worldwide.[3] Because of Nintendog's success, Nintendo has made several related products, including Nintendogs toys[4] and a series of Nintendogs trading cards.[5]

[edit] Gameplay




A Miniature Dachshund puppy being petted through use of the touch screen.


Using the touch screen, the owner can play with, train, pet, walk, and wash their virtual dog.[6] With the microphone that is built into the DS, the player can create voice commands that their puppy will understand and, if properly trained, follow.[7] Dogs can be walked to the park where they can practice their disc catching skills, and to the gymnasium to practice dog agility.[8] The game features two types of currency; money and "trainer points". Money is used to purchase items, while trainer points increase or decrease depending on the actions of the player.[citation needed] As points accumulate, more dogs become available for the player to adopt,[citation needed] and more background can be purchased to decorate the player's in-game house.[citation needed] By walking his or her dog, players earn trainer points; the amount of points varies depending on the length of the walk, and activities participated in on the way, such as contest training. While walking, question mark icons on the map point out areas that may contain neighborhood dogs or presents, though presents can be found unmarked as well. When encountering another dog and its trainer, the player's dog may fight or play with the other.[citation needed]
Only three dogs may be kept at the player's in-game dwelling at one time, and five dogs may be stored at the "Dog Hotel". The dogs may also be swapped, dropped off, and picked up at any time. The player may not have any more than eight dogs at a time, but dogs may be donated to make space for more pets.[citation needed] In caring for the dog, it can be fed with different types of food and groomed with varying items. As time passes without the dog being cared for, its condition will slowly deteriorate, as it becomes more hungry and dirty. If its condition is not amended for a long period of time, eventually the dog may run away, though it will eventually return, sometimes with a present.[citation needed] The dog does not age, meaning they remain as puppies.[9]
Nintendogs features a variety of contests, which are the player's main method of earning money and trainer points. There are three contests: Disc Competition, Agility Trial, and Obedience Trial. In each of them, there are 5 classes: Beginner, Open, Expert, Master, and Championship. Each contest is commented on by two men, named Archie Hubbs and Ted Rumsworth. If the player's dog places 3rd or higher in whatever class it is in, the dog will proceed to the next class, where the contest increases in difficulty level. Prize money earned differs depending on which contest has been entered, what place is finished, and the class the dog is in. If the player does not place at least 3rd, they will be dropped to the previous difficulty level, unless they were in the Beginner class, at which point they will remain there.[citation needed] Dogs that are especially dirty or hungry are not able to participate in contests.[citation needed]
Nintendogs supports a link-up method through the Nintendo DS's built-in wireless networking capabilities. A player can link his or her system with that of another person who owns a copy of Nintendogs to let the players' puppies play together. This is called "Bark Mode".[citation needed] If connected with a player who has a dog not in the current player's kennel, that dog will become available.[citation needed] Also, players can use an item called the "White Record" to record a message. This can be used to say something to the other player.[citation needed] Dogs may also carry a present to give away for good to the other player.[citation needed]

[edit] Development
Nintendogs began as a technical demo on the Nintendo GameCube long before it was considered for the DS. It made its way to the handheld when the DS was still in development. Shigeru Miyamoto originally came up with the idea for the game when he and his family bought a dog, which inspired him to create the project.[10] The game's producer, Hideki Konno, was looking for a game to take full advantage of all of the Nintendo DS' features, decided on a dog simulation game. Nintendogs, first called Puppy Times, was originally designed to have 15 different versions, one for each breed of dog. Satoru Iwata suggested this to convey the feel that the player was choosing a dog from a kennel. However, the debugging process for each version would have been too time consuming to be feasible. After going back and forth between numbers of versions, they eventually settled for three, with six dogs each and the rest available after completing in-game goals.[11]

[edit] Versions
Originally, three different versions of Nintendogs existed. In Japan, their subtitles were Chihuahua & Friends, Dachshund & Friends and Shiba & Friends.[citation needed] In North America, Singapore and Europe, the game's subtitles are maintained, but the Shiba & Friends title was changed to Lab & Friends, a more recognizable breed in those countries, though the Shiba Inu is still present in the game.[citation needed] Another version of Nintendogs, titled Nintendogs: Best Friends, has been bundled with teal and pink (in the U.S., the pink version was only available at Target and Toys "R" Us) Nintendo DS models.[citation needed] Europe had slightly different bundles: a pink DS bundle with the Dachshund version of the game, and a blue DS bundle with the Lab version.[citation needed] Another version called Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends was released in Europe,[12] and then later in North America and Singapore.[citation needed] This version includes the most popular breeds from the other versions, as well as the Dalmatian available for purchase from the beginning of the game, without the player needing to locate a special item.[citation needed]
All the regions' versions contain all the breeds and are all identical, except that four breeds are not available in the Japanese versions. The difference between versions is the selection of the six (or five in the Japanese versions) breeds which the player starts with, but the other breeds can be unlocked as the player progresses through the game. Unlocking occurs when the player achieves certain goals, for example gaining a certain number of trainer points or finding a particular object.[citation needed] The other difference is that each version has different exclusive items one can obtain whilst going out for a walk.[citation needed]

[edit] Reception
The game has been well received by critics, with an average score of 85% at Game Rankings.[2] In the May 2005 edition of the Famitsu, a popular Japanese gaming magazine, Nintendogs received a perfect 40/40 score. Only four other games had attained this score at the time.[13] It also received an 8.5 out of 10 in Nintendo Power.[citation needed] Game Informer gave Nintendogs an 8 out of 10, reflecting on the game's lack of an ending.[14] Game Oracle gave it 85% and a recommendation saying that unlike most sims has a lot of depth.

[edit] Awards
In addition to recognitions from publications such as Entertainment Weekly,[citation needed] BusinessWeek,[citation needed] and the Chicago Sun Times,[citation needed] Nintendogs also won a wide variety of awards.[citation needed]

E3 2005 Game Critics Awards: Best Handheld Game.[15]

[edit] Sales information

This title game also boosted the Nintendo DS system sales by over 4.2 times the previous week to 95,000 units, up from 22,000.[21] It was the 91st best-selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 142,591 copies combined, with lifetime sales of 1,850,984 combined.[22] Nintendogs also had very successful launches in North America and Europe, with first week sales of over 250,000[23] and 160,000[24] respectively.
On March 23, 2006 at GDC 2006, Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata announced that international sales of Nintendogs sales had reached 6 million.[25] By March 31, 2008, the game was the best-selling Nintendo DS game published by Nintendo.[26] As of January 30, 2009, all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 21.67 million copies worldwide, and it has retained its status as Nintendo's top first-party title for the DS.[27]

[edit] Legacy

[edit] Trading cards
In late 2005, Nintendo of America released the first series of Nintendogs "6-Card Fun Paks". Three different pack designs (each based on the US-released designs of the DS game) contains an assortment of "Collectible cards, stickers & more!". Each pack randomly contains two of 18 different 'Breed' cards, one of nine different "Dog in Training" Tip cards, one of six different 'Miscellaneous' cards, one of 18 different 'Pop-Up' Cards, one of six different sheets of stickers, one of four different temporary tattoos and one Sweepstakes card.[5]
A second series of these cards were released in early 2007 by Enterplay, LLC.[28] These cards, officially licensed by Nintendo, were created by the same individuals who worked on the first series. As such, the cards greatly resemble the first series. Keeping the "6-Card Fun Pak" name, each package contains two of 20 different "At the Kennel" cards (which feature all eighteen breeds from the games,[29] including the Dalmatian and Jack Russel Terrier), one of nine "Dog in Training" tip cards, one of four different 'Miscellaneous' cards, one of 20 different 'Pop-Up' Cards, one of six different sheets of stickers, one of four different temporary tattoos and one Sweepstakes card. The second series also features three different packages, this time with a Dalmatian, Beagle and Pug on the front of the package.

[edit] Plush toys
A line of Nintendogs plush toys were released in Japan, featuring the most popular breeds in each game.[4] They are also available at the Nintendo World Store. Various Nintendogs t-shirts were also made available at the Nintendo World Store as well.[citation needed] In Europe and Australia, a series of plush toys with an electronic sensor were released, and when the owner shook the bone, the dog would walk and bark.[citation needed] Nintendo has also released a set of plushes through Earthwood Toys.[citation needed]
