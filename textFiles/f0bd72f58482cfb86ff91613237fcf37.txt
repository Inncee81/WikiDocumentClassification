Human Leukocyte Antigen B*27 (subtypes B*2701-2724) is a class I surface antigen encoded by the B locus in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 and presents microbial antigens to T-cells. HLA-B27 is strongly associated with a certain set of autoimmune diseases referred to as the "seronegative spondyloarthropathies". In the general population, about 8% Caucasian, 4% African, 2-9% Chinese, and 0.1-0.5% Japanese have the HLA-B27 antigen. In Northern Scandinavia (Lapland), 24% of people are HLA-B27 positive while 1.8% have ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

[edit] Disease associations

[edit] Spondylarthropathies
The relationship between HLA-B27 and many diseases has not yet been fully elucidated. Though it is associated with a wide range of pathology, it does not appear to be the sole mediator in development of disease.[citation needed] For example, while 90% of people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are HLA-B27 positive, only a fraction of people with HLA-B27 ever develop AS. This raises two important questions: why don't all HLA-B27 positive people develop AS, and why do some people who are HLA-B27 negative develop it?[citation needed] The literature is inconclusive, though several theories have been suggested. Research however has been discontinued in many countries due to lack of funding.[citation needed]

[edit] Juvenile Spondylarthropathies
In Croatian children, two B27 alleles were found associated with disease, B*2702, B*2705.[3] The study showed also B*0702 in coorperation with B*27, the HLA-B*07/B*27 combination with D6S273-134 genomic marker allele and was found not to be the result of linkage disequilibrium. B*2795 was found to be dominant allele associated.

In addition to its connection with AS, HLA-B27 is implicated in Reiter's syndrome, certain eye disorders such as acute anterior uveitis and iritis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Reiter's syndrome then again, is statistically associated with AS.
