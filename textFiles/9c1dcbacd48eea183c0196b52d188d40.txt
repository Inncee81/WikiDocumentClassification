[edit] Kanteiryū (勘亭流)

This style is used for publicity and programmes for arts like kabuki and rakugo. Invented by Okazakiya Kanroku (岡崎屋 勘六 ?), the name derives from Okazaki's nickname, kantei (勘亭 ?).

[edit] Yosemoji (寄席文字)

The name yosemoji literally means "letters to draw in customers". A combination of kanteiryū and chōchinmoji, it was used for posters and flyers.

[edit] Kagomoji (篭文字)

This name literally means "cage letters". The characters are thick and square in shape. It is usually used in inverted form or sometimes as an outline.

[edit] Higemoji (髭文字)

These characters have little "whiskers" on them. This style is used for kakigōri and ramune signs as well as being a common style for sake labels.

[edit] Sumō moji (相撲文字)

Style of lettering used for sumo wrestling advertisements and programmes.

[edit] Chōchin moji (提灯文字)

These characters are the ones used on chōchin (hanging paper lanterns), such as the ones you might see outside a yakitori stand in Japan.

[edit] Kakuji (角字)

This very heavy, rectangular style is used for making seals.
