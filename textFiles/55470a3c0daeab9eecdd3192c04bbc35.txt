[edit] Early life
Nash was born in London [3] on 6 July 1987. She grew up in Harrow, North West London.[4] Nash first became interested in music during her childhood. She learned how to play the piano at Sandbach School. She attended St. John Fisher School (in Pinner) and moved onto the St Joan of Arc Catholic School, Rickmansworth. She was taught guitar by teacher Louis Michelle. She studied Theatre at the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in South London. She auditioned at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School but was rejected, after which she fell down a flight of stairs, breaking her foot. During her recovery, she was housebound and unable to move, so her mother bought her an electric guitar. Nash used this time to focus on her songwriting: she began to write some new songs, finished old ones and decided that she would book a gig at a local bar in Harrow called Trinity on Gayton Road for herself, to showcase her songs.

[edit] Career
Nash started her career in 2006. After several gigs, Nash uploaded her music to the social networking website MySpace. Nash found a manager for herself before proceeding to look for producers for her music.



"I usually create my music by looking through my diary, picking out creative words to express my life...and turn them into songs,"




[edit] Moshi Moshi Records
Nash's debut was a single, "Caroline's a Victim"/"Birds," produced and recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Sigurðsson and released through Moshi Moshi Records in February 2007. The release was limited to 1000 copies, and was available on only 7" vinyl. Due to demand another 1000 copies were made and sold out. CD Promo copies were produced for distribution to the press and DJs etc, and are occasionally available for sale. It is also featured on the CD "Moshi Moshi Singles Compilation". A video for the song was released and received airplay on MTV2. The video, directed by Kinga Burza. The B-side, "Birds", later featured on her début album, Made of Bricks. Both tracks have also been released as MP3 downloads.

[edit] Fiction Records
In April 2007, Nash was signed to the Polydor offshoot Fiction Records.[5] Nash's second single and first through Fiction Records, "Foundations", which she co-wrote with producer Paul Epworth, was released on 18 June 2007 and reached number two in the official UK Singles Chart. Following "Foundations," Fiction announced plans to bring forward the release of Nash's debut album to 6 August 2007. The album, Made of Bricks, produced by Paul Epworth, included many of the tracks she had been performing on her two nationwide tours.
The album was leaked to filesharing networks days before its commercial release, and has received mixed reviews, The Independent describing it as being in "pole position for worst album of the year."[6] The album reached number 1 in the UK charts.[7]
During mid-2007, Nash performed at numerous festivals including Wireless Festival, Bestival, the Electric Gardens, Glastonbury, Latitude, Reading and Leeds, Oxegen and T in the Park. She made her official TV performance début on Later with Jools Holland.
Regarding the recording of a new album, Nash told NME that she had been inspired by The Supremes and has written a song called "Cat Song" in their honour.[8] She is also set to release a duet single with Billy Bragg, a cover of The Shangri-Las "Give Him A Great Big Kiss". As of October 2008 Nash is writing material for her second album which may have a more punk influenced sound. Nash is hoping to release the album in the UK during the summer of 2009.[9]
In late March of 2009 Nash made the following comments regarding the recording of her new album during an interview with the BBC Newsbeat program. "I've done a bunch of demos. I've got about 14 to 16 songs recorded and I'm going to do another session at the end of the month. It's really cool. I've been doing a lot of writing and I'm excited about getting stuck into new material. It's different and it's fun to be doing something new." She previously previewed two new tracks - "Froggy" and "I Hate Seagulls" - at an intimate gig at the Matter music venue in east London in October of 2008.[10]

[edit] Featured Artist Coalition
Nash has lent her support to the Featured Artist Coalition an organization whose goal is to give artists more say in the music industry decision process. Nash cited the emerging digital age as a reason artists should have a voice in decisions that effect their careers.[11]
