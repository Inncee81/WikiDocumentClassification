Lemur Control Surface


The Lemur Input Device is a highly-customizable multi-touch device from French company JazzMutant which serves as a controller for musical devices such as synthesizers and mixing consoles as well as for other media applications such as video performances. As an audio tool, the Lemur's role is equivalent to that of a MIDI controller in a MIDI studio setup, except that the Lemur uses the Open Sound Control protocol, a proposed high-speed networking replacement for MIDI. The controller is especially well-suited for use with Reaktor and Max/MSP, tools for building custom software synthesizers.

[edit] Creating an interface
The Lemur comes with its own proprietary software called the JazzEditor to create interfaces. Users can build interfaces using a selection of 15 different objects (including fader, knobs, pads, sliders...), group them as modules and arrange them using as many pages as needed. Each object can then receive any MIDI or OSC attribute. A particularity of the Lemur is the ability to modify the physical behavior of each object (for instance adding or removing friction on faders). The internal memory of the Lemur enables to store many interfaces, each one controlling a specific software for instance.
