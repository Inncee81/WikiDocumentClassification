The Agile Manifesto[1] is a statement of the principles that underpin agile software development. It was drafted from 11 to 13 February 2001, at The Lodge at the Snowbird ski resort in the Wasatch Range of mountains in Utah[2], where representatives of various new methodologies such as Extreme Programming, Scrum, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature Driven Development, Pragmatic programming, met to discuss the need for lighter alternatives to the traditional heavyweight methodologies.
The 17 authors of the manifesto were: Kent Beck, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, James Grenning, Jim Highsmith, Andrew Hunt, Ron Jeffries, Jon Kern, Brian Marick, Robert C. Martin, Steve Mellor, Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, Dave Thomas
