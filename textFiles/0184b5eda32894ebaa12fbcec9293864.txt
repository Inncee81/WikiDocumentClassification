[edit] Format
The TV series is made by Isis Productions and distributed by Eagle Rock Entertainment. It is shown on various broadcasters including BBC, ITV, Sky Arts, VH1 and VH1 Classic. They are also available on DVD.
The music, and its production, is dissected by the musicians and/or producer playing the multitrack recordings and singling out tracks that one does not usually consciously hear when listening to the music, giving insight into the way the sound is built up. Also, the individual musicians play back pieces, which are then blended with the original recording. Almost all songs are dealt with, focusing almost entirely on the music itself, how it was composed/realised. Personal aspects of the band or members are occasionally dealt with, but mostly only if they serve this purpose. TV episodes are 50 minutes long but the DVD releases contain much additional material. All the releases in this series are done with the co-operation and full authorisation of the artists involved.
The most recent episode in the series covered Duran Duran - Rio. This was released on DVD in October 2008.

[edit] History
They were devised by radio producer John Pidgeon as a vehicle for Roger Scott, following the disc jockey’s move from Capital Radio to BBC Radio 1 in 1988. The first hour-long series, produced independently by John and Roger, opened with Dire Straits’ Brothers In Arms in May 1989, followed by the Rolling Stones’ Beggar’s Banquet, Genesis’ Invisible Touch, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, The Who's Who's Next, Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds, Police’s Synchronicity, the Eagles’ Hotel California and U2’s The Joshua Tree. Roger died of cancer five months later, and the second series aired posthumously. Further programs were presented by Richard Skinner.

[edit] False episodes
There have been some DVD documentaries released with the phrase "Classic Albums" in the title that are, in truth, of no relation to the Classic Albums television series. These documentaries are not produced by Eagle Rock Entertainment and do not air as part of the series on VH1 and BBC. They are released by a company called Classic Rock Legends [2][3].
They are identifiable by the fact that the Classic Albums logo does not appear on the box art. They also do not feature the original artwork of the album under discussion on the DVD cover, but reinterpreted drawings which resemble said artwork. The program itself does not feature interviews from members of the bands and suffer a great reduction in general production quality. The most notable difference is the fact that music from the album on discussion is not featured, but instead songs by cover bands performing these works.
These titles include:

Green Day - Dookie
Guns N' Roses - Appetite for Destruction
