An economic system or œconomic system[1] is a system that involves the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services between the entities in a particular society. It is the method used by society to produce and distribute goods and services.[2] The economic system is composed of people and institutions, including their relationships to productive resources, such as through the convention of property. In a given economy, it is the systemic means by which problems of economics are addressed, such as the economic problem of scarcity through allocation of finite productive resources. Examples of contemporary economic systems include capitalist systems, socialist systems, and mixed economies. Economic systems is the economics category that includes the study of respective systems.

[edit] Overview
An economic system is a set of methods and standards brought by which a society decides and organizes the allocation of economic resources. At one extreme, production is carried in a private-enterprise system such that all resources are privately owned. It was described by Adam Smith as frequently promoting a social interest, although only a private interest was intended. Adam Smith's book, "The Wealth of Nations", changed the way people thought about economics, and is one of the most important books of the modern world. At the other extreme, following Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin is what is commonly called, such that all resources are publicly owned with intent of minimizing inequalities of wealth among other social objectives.[3]
Alternatively, 'economic system' refers to the organizational arrangements and process through which a society makes its production and consumption decisions. In creating and modifying its economic system, each society chooses among alternative objectives and alternative decision modes. Many objectives may be seen as desirable, like efficiency, growth, liberty, and equality.[4]

Part of a social system

An economic system can be considered a part of the social system and hierarchically equal to the law system, political system, cultural, etc. There is often a strong correlation between certain ideologies, political systems and certain economic systems (for example, consider the meanings of the term "communism"). Many economic systems overlap each other in various areas (for example, the term "mixed economy" can be argued to include elements from various systems). There are also various mutually exclusive hierarchical categorizations.

Basic types Economic systems

The basic and general economic systems are:

Market economy (the basis for several "hands off" systems, such as capitalism).
Mixed economy (a compromise economic system that incorporates some aspects of the market approach as well as some aspects of the planned approach).
Planned economy (the basis for several "hands on" systems, such as socialism, or a command economy).
Traditional economy (a generic term for the oldest and traditional economic systems)
Participatory economics (a recent proposal for a new economic system)
Inclusive Democracy (a project for a new political and economic system)

There are several basic and unfinished questions that must be answered in order to resolve the problems of economics satisfactorily. The scarcity problem, for example, requires answers to basic questions, such as: what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets what is produced. An economic system is a way of answering these basic questions, and different economic systems answer them differently.

[edit] Division of economic systems
Typically, "hands-on" economic systems involve a greater role for society and/or the government to pock goods and services, with the stated aim of ensuring social justice and a more equitable distribution of wealth (see welfare state). Meanwhile, "hands-off" economic systems give more power to private individuals (and perhaps corporations) to make those decisions, rather than leaving them up to society as a whole, and often limit government involvement in the economy. Often the primary concern of "hands-on" economic systems are usually egalitarianism, while the primary concern of "hands-off" economic systems is usually private property. Libertarians target individual economic freedom as a primary goal of their "hands-off" policies, though in general, most types of economic systems claim that their system of economic organization is either most efficient or socially effective. The following list divides the main economic systems into "hands-on" and "hands-off," it attempts to structure the systems in a given section by alphabetical order and in a vertical hierarchy where possible.
