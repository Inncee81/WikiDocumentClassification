Apple - MacBook Pro


The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh portable computers by Apple Inc.
First introduced in January 2006 at the Macworld Expo alongside the Intel-based iMac, the MacBook Pro replaced the PowerBook G4 and was the second computer to be announced in the Apple Intel transition (after the iMac). Positioned at the high end of the MacBook family, the MacBook Pro is aimed at the professional and power user market.
There have been two designs for the MacBook Pro, both using aluminum. The first design was largely a carry-over from the PowerBook G4. The second "unibody" design is a more tapered design with most of the casing made from a single block of aluminum.

[edit] Discrete MacBook Pro




The Original MacBook Pro.


The original 15" MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 during Steve Jobs' keynote at the MacWorld Expo. The 17" model was later introduced on April 24, 2006. When first introduced, the MacBook Pro was noted for lacking FireWire 800 and S-Video ports, although FireWire 800 was added to later MacBook Pro models. Other changes included a built in iSight webcam and the introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked to prevent the laptop from being pulled off a surface. This feature was later brought over to the MacBook as well.

[edit] Unibody MacBook Pro
At a notebook-oriented announcement in Cupertino on October 14, 2008 Apple announced a new 15" MacBook Pro featuring a unibody construction and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air. All of the MacBook Pro's ports were shifted to the left side of the case and the optical drive slot on the right side, similar to the MacBook. The FireWire 400 port was removed while the FireWire 800 port remains, and the DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle.
A 17" MacBook Pro with unibody construction was announced by Phil Schiller during the 2009 MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6. This version diverged from its 15" sibling with a non-removable lithium polymer battery and an anti-glare screen option.

[edit] Industrial design
The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor--albeit wider and deeper. The high-gloss screen is covered by a reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option is available in the 17" model in which the glass panel is removed. The trackpad has also been enlarged with the entire pad being the physical button, allowing for more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys. The hard drive is easily replaceable in the 15" unibody model, whereas in the discrete-construction 15", and in both versions of the 17" model, replacing the hard drive requires a significant disassembly of the system.

[edit] Battery
According to a video from engineers at Apple during the new 17" MacBook Pro's introduction, the non-removable battery is of a unique design unlike any existing notebook battery; instead of implementing traditional round cells inside the battery's casing, all available space is utilized, providing increased capacity. Apple has stated that the 17" MacBook Pro has a rated battery life of 8 hours, and can be recharged 1000 times while still holding 80% of its original charge.
