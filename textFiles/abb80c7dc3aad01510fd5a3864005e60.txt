[edit] Features
It is coded completely in the Java programming language, but data is written in language-independent formats.
Nutch has a highly modular architecture allowing developers to create plugins for the following activities: media-type parsing, data retrieval, querying and clustering.
The fetcher ("robot" or "web crawler") has been written from scratch solely for this project.

[edit] History
Nutch originated with Doug Cutting (creator of both Lucene and Hadoop) and Mike Cafarella.
In June 2003, there was a successful 100 million page demo system. To meet the multimachine processing needs of the crawl and index tasks, the Nutch project has also implemented a MapReduce facility and a distributed file system. These two facilities have been spun out into their own subproject called Hadoop.
As of June 2005, Nutch has graduated from the Apache Incubator, and is now a subproject of Lucene.

[edit] Scalability
IBM Research studied the performance[1] of Nutch/Lucene as part of its Commercial Scale Out (CSO) project [2]. Their findings were that a scale-out system, such as Nutch/Lucene, could achieve a performance level on a cluster of blades that was not achievable on any scale-up computer such as the Power5.
