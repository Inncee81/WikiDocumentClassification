Stigler's law of eponymy is a process proposed by University of Chicago statistics professor Stephen Stigler in his 1980 publication "Stigler’s law of eponymy" [1]. In its simplest and strongest form it says: "No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer."

[edit] Derivation


“
Stigler’s Law was discovered many times before Stigler named it.[2]
”


Historical acclaim and reputation tend to be allocated to people unevenly. Scientific observations and results are often associated with people who have high visibility and social status, and are named long after their discovery. Eponymy is a striking example of this phenomenon. Particularly important scientific observations are often associated with a person, as in the case of Gaussian distribution, Halley's comet, and Planck's constant.
Historians of science, however, have noted that often the person who is associated with the particular observation, theory, or result was not its original inventor. Based on his studies on the history of statistics, Stephen Stigler therefore proposed his own "Stigler's Law of Eponymy." Stigler attributes the discovery of Stigler's Law to Robert K. Merton (which makes the law self-referencing).

[edit] Similar concepts
Stigler's law is an example of the idea of multiple discovery, which stands in contrast with the heroic theory of invention and scientific development.
Stephen Stigler's father, the economist George Stigler, also examined the process of discovery in economics. He said that "If an earlier, valid statement of a theory falls on deaf ears, and a later restatement is accepted by the science, this is surely proof that the science accepts ideas only when they fit into the then-current state of the science". He gave several examples in which the original discoverer was not recognized as such.[3]
The Matthew Effect was coined by Robert K. Merton to describe how eminent scientists get more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is similar, so that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous.
"Everything of importance has been said before by somebody who did not discover it" is an adage attributed to Alfred North Whitehead.[4]
