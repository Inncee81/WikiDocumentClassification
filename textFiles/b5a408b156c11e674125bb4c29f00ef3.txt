MediaPortal is an open source media center software with a 10-foot user interface design for the living-room TV that acts as front-end for Personal Video Recorder (PVR), video, pictures, music and many more functionalities. MediaPortal runs under Microsoft Windows unlike most other open source media center programs, such as MythTV and Freevo, which run on Linux.
MediaPortal allows a computer to perform many entertainment-related tasks, such as recording, pausing, and rewinding live television, much like a PVR box such as TiVo. Other functionality includes watching video, listening to music with dynamic playlist building based on the social music network Last.fm, launching and playing games, recording live radio and browsing picture collections. MediaPortal supports a plugin system and a skin engine allowing users to extend the base software.
