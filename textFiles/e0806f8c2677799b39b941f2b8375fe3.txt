[edit] History
The settlement Fucking has existed since at least 1070 and is named after a man from the 6th century called Focko. "-ing" is an old Germanic suffix indicating the people of the root word to which it is attached; thus Fucking means "(place of) Focko’s people."[4] The village has a population of 104.
Fucking's most famous feature is a traffic sign with its name on it, beside which tourists often stop to have their photograph taken. It is a commonly stolen street sign.[5] Significant public funds have been spent on replacing the stolen signs.[6]
In 2004, mainly due to the stolen signs, a vote was held on changing the village's name, but the residents voted against doing so.[4] According to the town mayor, Siegfried Hauppl:


“
We had a vote last year on whether to rename the town, but decided to keep it as it is. After all, Fucking has existed for 800 years, probably when a Mr Fuck or the Fuck family moved into the area. The 'ing' was added as a word for settlement.[4]
”


In August 2005, the road signs were replaced with theft-resistant signs welded to steel and secured in concrete to prevent further chances of the sign being stolen.[6] Few thefts have since occurred, but it remains a problem.[citation needed]
