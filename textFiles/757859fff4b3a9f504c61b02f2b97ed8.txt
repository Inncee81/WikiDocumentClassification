For another use of "ORM", see Object role modelling.
Object-relational mapping (aka ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in relational databases and object-oriented programming languages[1]. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.

[edit] Problem description
Data management tasks in object-oriented (OO) programming are typically implemented by manipulating objects that are almost always non-scalar values. For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a "person object" with "slots" to hold the data that comprise the entry: the person's name, a list (or array) of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain "phone number objects" and so on. The address book entry is treated as a single value by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as a method to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on.
However, many popular database products such as SQL DBMS can only store and manipulate scalar values such as integers and strings organized within tables. The programmer must either convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database (and convert them back upon retrieval), or only use simple scalar values within the program. Object-relational mapping is used to implement the first approach.
The height of the problem is translating those objects to forms that can be stored in the database for easy retrieval, while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships; these objects are then said to be persistent.

[edit] Pros and cons
The O/R mapping also reduces most often the lines of code programmed, making the software more robust (the fewer the lines, the fewer the errors that will occur)[2].
There are pros and cons for using the O/R mapping. For instance, some O/R mapping tools do not perform well when a bulk of data is deleted. Stored procedures will have better performance, but are not portable. But in general, the pros outweigh the cons when using this paradigm[3].

[edit] Non-SQL databases
Another solution would be to use an object-oriented database management system (OODBMS), which, as the name implies, is a database designed specifically for working with object-oriented values. Using an OODBMS would eliminate the need for converting data to and from its SQL form, as the data would be stored in its original object representation.
Object-oriented databases have yet to come into widespread use. One of their main limitations is that switching from an SQL DBMS to a purely object-oriented DBMS means you lose the capability to create SQL queries, a tried and tested method for retrieving ad-hoc combinations of data. For this reason, many programmers find themselves more at home with an object-SQL mapping system, even though most commercial object-oriented databases are able to process SQL queries to a limited extent.

^ Object-relational mapping is used to map object-oriented programming objects to relational databases managed by Oracle, DB2, Sybase, and other relational database managers (RDBMSs).
^ Lines of code using O/R are only a fraction of those needed for a call-level interface (1:4). For this exercise, 496 lines of code were needed using the ODMG Java Binding compared to 1,923 lines of code using JDBC.
^ Bulk updates or deletions: Hibernate is not very good on this point.
