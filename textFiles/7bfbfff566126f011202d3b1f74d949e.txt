Linksys WRT54G version 1.0


Linksys WRT54G (and variants WRT54GS, WRT54GL, and WRTSL54GS) is a Wi-Fi capable residential gateway from Linksys. The device is capable of sharing Internet connections among several computers via 802.3 Ethernet and 802.11b/g wireless data links.
The WRT54G is notable for being the first consumer-level network device that had its firmware source code released to satisfy the obligations of the GNU GPL. This allows programmers to modify the firmware to change or add functionality to the device. Several third-party firmware projects provide the public with enhanced firmware for the WRT54G. See Third party firmware projects.

[edit] WRT54G
The original WRT54G was first released in December 2002. It comes with a 4+1 port network switch (the Internet/WAN port is also in the same internal network switch, but on a different VLAN). The devices have two removable antennas connected through Reverse Polarity TNC connectors. The WRT54GC router is an exception and has an internal antenna with optional external antenna. As a cost-cutting measure, the design of the latest version of the WRT54G no longer has detachable antennas or TNC connectors. Instead, version 8 routers simply route thin wires into antenna 'shells' eliminating the connector. As a result, Linksys HGA7T and similar external antennas are no longer compatible with this model.

[edit] WRT54GS
The WRT54GS is nearly identical to WRT54G except for additional RAM, flash memory, and SpeedBooster software. Versions 1 to 3 of this router have 8MB of flash memory. Since most third parties' firmware only use up to 4MB flash, a JFFS2 based r/w filesystem can be created and used on the remaining 4MB free flash. This allows for greater flexibility of configurations and scripting, enabling this small router to both load balance multiple ADSL lines (multi homed) or to be run as a hardware layer 2 load balancer (with appropriate third party firmware).[4]

[edit] WRT54GL
Linksys released the WRT54GL in 2005 to support third-party firmware based on Linux, after the original WRT54G line was switched from Linux to VxWorks, starting with version 5. The WRT54GL is technically a reissue of the version 4 WRT54G. Cisco is currently being sued by the FSF for GPL infringement.[6]

[edit] WRT54GC
WRT54GC series with 802.11b/g support. This unit has a four port 10/100 switch and one WAN port. The "C" in the router number stands for compact, as the unit measures 4" by 4" by 1" with an internal antenna. The unit can be expanded with addition of HGA7S external antenna to boost range. Hardware Version 1.0 is the only option available in the United States since introduction in 2005.
Version 2.0 is shipping in, amongst other countries, the United Kingdom. This unit has 1MB flash, 4MB RAM and a non-detachable external antenna.
The internal hardware is based on a Marvell ARM914 ("Libertas") reference design which is probably identical to the SerComm IP806SM, Xterasys XR-2407G, Abocom ARM914, Hawking HWGR54 Revision M, and the Airlink 101 AR315W. By appropriately changing the value of the firmware byte 0x26, the WRT54GC can be cross-flashed with firmware based on the same reference platform.[12]
There are reports that a sister platform of the WRT54GC (the AR315W) has been hacked to run Linux.[13]

Other Cellular Providers
To use this router with other Cellular providers, you MUST use an Alternative Firmware provider. The Stock Firmware does not support Cellular Providers even though you do have the exact supported aircard. eg: Telus Mobility (CANADA) uses the Sierra Wireless Aircard 595 which is supported by this router but because it is from Telus Mobility and not from Sprint (USA), it will never load the card into the router to make it operational.

[edit] WRT54G-TM
The WRT54G-TM (TM stands for T-Mobile) is also called the T-Mobile "Hotspot@Home" service. It allows calls to be made via T-Mobile's GSM network or via WiFi (UMA - Unlicensed Mobile Access), using the same telephone and phone number (a special dual-mode phone designed for the service is required i.e. Blackberry Pearl 8120). Additionally, once a call is in progress, one may transition from WiFi to GSM (and vice versa) seamlessly, as WiFi signal comes and goes, such as when entering or exiting a home or business. A special router is not needed to use the service, but the T-Mobile branded routers are supposed to enhance the telephone's battery life. This is the only known tweak to the TM version of the firmware. The hardware appears to be like WRT54GL however has 32MB ram and 8MB flash. Upgrading to third party firmware via JTAG method, upgrade CFE to WRT54GL 1.1, allows flash upgrade as the stock WRT54G-TM. CFE prevents third party firmware upgrades.
The WRT54G-TM having a serial number that starts with C061 has these specifications:

Broadcom BCM5352EKPBG CPU
32 MB RAM (Hynix HY5DU561622ETP-D43)

T-Mobile Edition WRT54GS V3.0 (Renamed WRT54G-TM). Upgrading to third party firmware can be done either with a JTAG (and flashing a WRT54GL v1.1 CFE to the router) or by flashing Tornado's CFE Updater (made for the TM) through the web interface. The JTAG method is then followed by flashing the latest Linksys WRT54GL firmware to the router via TFTP then finally using the webgui to flash the third-party firmware onto the router. The CFE Updater method is followed by a simple TFTP transfer of the new third-party firmware. Putting OpenWRT onto the router is easiest by first installing DD-WRT. Then, after DD-WRT is running, use the update firmware page to place the OpenWRT image onto the router.

[edit] Hardware versions affect firmware compatibility
As of January 2006, most third-party firmware is no longer compatible with version 5 of both the WRT54G and the WRT54GS. The amount of flash memory in the version 5 devices has been reduced to 2 MB, too small for current Linux-based third-party firmware. (See table above for information on identifying the version based on the serial number printed on the bottom of the unit, and on the outside of the shrink-wrapped retail box.)
Some users have succeeded in flashing and running a stripped down but fully functional version of DD-WRT called 'micro' on a version 5 WRT54G.[24][25] An easier method not requiring any disassembly of the device has since been devised for flashing v5-v8 to DD-WRT.[26][27]
To support third-party firmware, Linksys has re-released the WRT54G v4, under the new model name WRT54GL (the 'L' in this name allegedly stands for 'Linux').

[edit] CPU
According to OpenWrt,[28] the Linksys WRT54G series use several different processors, all of them 32-bit MIPS architecture processors manufactured by Broadcom.

[edit] Performance
The WRT54G CPU can be overclocked using a third-party firmware, such as DD-WRT. Overheating may accompany overclocking since the CPU does not have a heatsink - attaching a small heatsink, such as a video card memory heatsink, to the router's CPU will also help dissipate the heat. The router temperature can be lowered by adding a fan to the WRT54G casing which can be powered externally or wired into the router's main power.[29] In some cases a resistor or Rheostat is required to reduce power voltage to the fan.

Some performance issues have been encountered with the Linksys firmware which may cause sluggish or total network failure. This is usually caused by a large number of connections clogging the router, in other words NAT table overflow. Symptoms of NAT table overflow include inability to initiate new network connections whilst existing connections remain active. This is due to the small size of the NAT lookup table in default Netgear firmware coupled with a long table entry timeout. Installing a third-party firmware such as DD-WRT allows the user to change these values to prevent or delay NAT table overflow occurring. Installing a third party firmware and increasing the maximum ports setting to allow more connections is the usual solution (in DD-WRT found under Administration->Management->Maximum Ports).

[edit] Configuration of WRT54Gx as switch
(verified with WRT54G v2, other vesion setups might differ slightly) Many people have ADSL models and routers supplied with their connections and might end up with a spare WRT54G with perfectly good ports and a wireless connection.
To turn this into a "dumb" switch do the following:

Change the default IP address (192.168.1.1) if the router has the same default IP address to avoid conflicts.
Under Basic Setup disable DHCP, save settings.
Under Advanced Routing change it from "Gateway" to "Router", save settings.
Plug a network cable into the router and into 1 of the numbered gates in the WRT54G, and you're now good to go.
