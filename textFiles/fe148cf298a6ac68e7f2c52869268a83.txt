[edit] Education
At the age of 19, Carter spent a year studying in Holland where he learned from Jan van Krimpen's assistant P. H. Raedisch. Raedisch taught Carter the art of punch cutting at the Joh. Enschedé type foundry. By 1961 Carter was able to use the skills he acquired to cut his own version of the semi-bold typeface Dante.

[edit] Career
Carter eventually returned to London where he became a freelancer as well as the typographic advisor to Crosfield Electronics, distributors of Photon phototypesetting machines. Carter designed many typefaces for Mergenthaler Linotype as well. Under Linotype, Carter created well known typefaces such as the 100-year replacement typeface for Bell Telephone Company.
In 1981, Carter and his colleague Mike Parker created Bitstream Inc.[1] This digital type foundry is currently one of the largest suppliers of type. He left Bitstream in 1991 to form the Carter & Cone type foundry with Cherie Cone. Matthew Carter focuses on improving many typefaces' readability. He designs specifically for Apple and Microsoft computers. Georgia and Verdana are two fonts that have been created primarily for viewing on computer monitors. Carter has designed type for magazines such as Time, The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Boston Globe, Wired, and Newsweek. He is a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale (AGI,) is a senior critic for Yale's Graphic design program, has served as chairman of ATypI, and is an ex officio member of the board of directors of the Society of Typographic Aficionados (SOTA).
Carter has won numerous awards for his significant contributions to typography and design, including an honoris causa Doctorate of Humane Letters from the Art Institute of Boston, an AIGA medal in 1995, and the 2005 SOTA Typography Award. A retrospective of his work, "Typographically Speaking, The Art of Matthew Carter," was exhibited at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in December 2002.
In 2007, Carter designed a new variant of the typeface Georgia for use in the graphical user interface of the Bloomberg Terminal.
