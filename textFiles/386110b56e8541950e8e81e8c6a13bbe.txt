[edit] Operation of .mobi
DotMobi domain names were made available for public registration on September 26, 2006. Although introduced quite recently, .mobi has already made headlines with several domain sales in the hundred-thousand-dollar range, including Flowers.mobi,[4] Sportsbook.mobi,[5] and Fun.mobi,[6] possibly indicating the confidence developers have in this young extension. It has also had its share of criticism due to allegedly breaking the principles of device independence[7]. Providing content tailored to particular devices can be done by other means than a specific TLD, such as using hostnames within an existing domain, content negotiation through the HTTP protocol, cascading style sheets, or other forms of adaptation.
Additionally, some have pointed out that "mobi" is an unfortunate choice for mobile phone text entry interfaces, requiring nine or ten keystrokes in many common setups, compared to seven for "com", or what could have only been three if "wap" was used.[8] However, there is a possibility that mobile phone manufacturers may in the future default their mobile internet browsers to .mobi or that predictive-text input features will reduce this to one keystroke, either of which would effectively eliminate this issue.
dotMobi engaged with the W3C Mobile Web Initiative (MWI) to help formulate the MWI Best Practices for mobile content. The practices outlined a number of ways to achieve good user experiences on mobile Web-enabled devices, and recognized several methods of implementing these practices.
mTLD has released a free testing tool called Ready.mobi to analyze the mobile readiness of websites. It does a free page analysis and gives a .mobi Ready score from 1 to 5. This report tests the mobile-readiness of the site using dotMobi's recommended best practices.
Free authoring tools can also be utilized to create mobi-compatible sites. Site.mobi, offered by mTLD and powered by mobiSiteGalore, is a free browser-based mobile website builder tool that guarantees a fully .mobi-compliant mobile website. mTLD also offers free training and ebooks about .mobi at mobiForge.com and a free emulator to view mobile webpages on a PC.
On February 12, 2008, dotMobi launched a low cost device database to help web developers build sites able to dynamically adapt presentation of a web site for the specific device that is being used by the user. Called DeviceAtlas, it can be accessed via a web GUI (for browsing and editing device attribute) or via an API (written in .NET, PHP, and Perl) to perform device detection and return device attributes such as screen dimension for subsequent content adaptation. The web GUI is free while an annual fee is charged for the API (dotMobi claims that they are charging for the API on a break even basis). Data for the DeviceAtlas database comes from several sources including handset manufacturers, operator handset testing teams, content trans-coding companies, mobile testing companies, public domain databases, and the public via the web GUI. Data from multiple sources are merged together but the source is always maintained. Conflicts in data from multiple sources are highlighted such that owners of the data are able to spot potential errors and provide corrections. The DeviceAtlas community approach was designed to provide all web site owners with access to low cost device data while at the same time provide a quality assurance platform for those that provide mobile phone design and test data. DeviceAtlas attributes were based upon the output of the W3C Mobile Web Initiative Device Descriptions Working Group.
There are technical solutions that also provide similar benefits as .mobi: compressing/downsampling proxy servers and microbrowsers, like Opera Mobile, which can tailor any website to small display (using Small Screen Rendering technique). However, these browsers must still download an entire page (with graphics and other related files) which, if not optimized for mobile phones, can be time-consuming and expensive to download. To improve the latter issue, the two adaptation techniques can be used together. This is the idea behind proxy-based microbrowsers like Opera Mini that download the optimized and compressed version of web pages through dedicated proxy servers. However, web pages viewed on a mobile via a proxy-based microbrowser are rarely specifically designed for a mobile phone, so it is left up to the proxy server and browser to decide what to compress, what to display, and how to display it, which, unlike the .mobi version of the site, may not necessarily be how the web page owner intends for the mobile audience.
There are also specialized content adaptation solutions, that typically operate on a server, where they employ specialized adaptation techniques to provide optimized representations of Web sites to mobile devices regardless of what browser they use. However, .mobi eliminates the intermediary step of having to adapt content for mobile phone as the sites are specifically designed for viewing on a mobile phone.
The W3C is also developing new authoring languages, such as DIAL (the Device Independent Authoring Language), which aid authors in creating Web sites that can be used on the huge variety of mobile devices available today. Some adaptation solutions already support the use of DIAL and similar languages in creating sites that can be used with .mobi domain names. Other open source initiatives include WURFL which addresses the problem with a large database of browser identification strings.
The .mobi organization does not itself mandate any particular technology, but does require that .mobi sites produce user experiences consistent with their guidelines and specifically optimized for mobile phones.

[edit] Advantages of .mobi
Since 100% of .mobi sites must be optimized for viewing on a mobile phone, the main advantage of .mobi, from the users' perspective, is that they are theoretically guaranteed a site optimized for usage on the go. This means hard factors such as smaller screens, device form/size, device input/output options, existence of embedded sensors (acceleration, location, touch, light/darkness, ambient noise), as well as soft factors such as expectations of immediacy of results, context awareness under a shortened attention span (compared to home/desktop use of the Internet). Although a .com or any other extension can technically employ the same optimizations for mobile phones as .mobi sites, in practice, only a fraction of them are, thus necessitating content adaptation solutions. These retrofit the content to target devices independent from the original process of creating the site.[9]
As distinguished management of targeted content by country codes - usually done at the Top Level (e.g. with .JP and .DE) is not possible at the top level domain for .mobi domain names, facilitating this can be achieved by offering country targeted content segmenting its administrative realms using third level domains, obviously these same ones representing the two letter country code of the respective ccTLD that is commonly used for the same market for content non-designated to explicitly support mobile use.
For globally relevant sites, this structure allows the site owner to bundle all mobile content of a site for all geographies in a single entry point, while still allowing full administrative delegation to the locally responsible stakeholders. These would choose how to present its content based on user preferences, for example with respect to desired language choices in a national population, for example English/Spanish in the USA, or French/Italian/German in Switzerland.

[edit] Disadvantages of .mobi
dotMobi risks creating two separate device-dependent World Wide Webs, one PC/desktop-based and the other mobile-based, and thus risks producing redundant content.[10]
Also, companies and private persons have to register and take care of two domains/websites, instead of one whose pages would be adjusted to the output media through Cascading Style Sheets.

[edit] Sponsors of .mobi
dotMobi is backed by mobile network operators, mobile phone and infrastructure vendors , and Internet search and content providers.

[edit] Allocation of premium names
mTLD has compiled a list of approximately 5,700 commonly used words and phrases that have been set aside for equitable allocation other than in the traditional first, come, first-served system. This was designed to 1) create a more level playing field in the allocation of these names, 2) increase the likelihood that these domain names will more promptly provide the mobile community with new features and services, and 3) preserve the stability and security of registry operations.[12] mTLD will be allocating these premium names via auction and Request for Proposal (RFP) processes on a quarterly basis through 2008. The process was approved by ICANN with input from mTLD's Policy Advisory Board and WIPO. Disputes that arise over .mobi domain names can be filed and administered by the National Arbitration Forum. Disputes are decided by one of 147 experts on the National Arbitration Forum's intellectual property panel.
On September 13, 2007, dotMobi announced the auction of 100 premium .mobi domains via Sedo to commemorate their 1 year anniversary since public launch.
dotMobi has sold hundreds of domain names through the auction process, but it has not been without controversy. In one auction, dotMobi sold Music.mobi $616,000. The auction was voided due to technical problems at Sedo. Also, none of the top 25 most expensive domains sold at the first auction met their compliance deadlines to have active web sites.

[edit] Reserved names
In connection with the roll-out of the .mobi top level domain, dotMobi has reserved names as per its contract with ICANN. These terms include dotMobi terms, other TLDs, emergency numbers and geographic names. The first geographic .mobi domain to be released was Helsinki.mobi.[13]
