From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
S. R. Ranganathan, known as the "the father of library science in India," and respected by librarians all over the world, proposed five laws of library science. Many librarians worldwide accept them as the foundations of their philosophy (e.g. Koehler et al, 2000)
These laws are:

Books are for use.
Every reader his [or her] book.
Every book its reader.
Save the time of the User.
The library is a growing organism.

The Five Laws of Library Science are some of the most influential concepts in that field. Since they were published in 1931, these five laws “have remained a centerpiece of professional values...” (Rubin 2004). These basic theories of Library Science continue to directly affect the development of this discipline and the service of all libraries.
S. R. Ranganathan’s early education was of a mathematic background. This systematic way of thinking, he later applied to his work in library science, most notably his work on library classification and administration. (Indian Statistical Institute Library, et al 2007) “From the middle of the nineteenth century, librarians in the west felt the need and started emphasizing the importance of enhanced services to library patrons. Formulation of the Five Laws of Library Science at long last, provided a solid and lasting foundation in this direction.” (Kabir 2003)

[edit] An explanation of the five laws

[edit] First law: Books are for use
The 1st law of library science is "Books are for use' Which implies that a book should be durable & the material of which it is made should have longevity. The 1st law insists upon intensifying the use of books by every possible method and it urges the library profession to select such edition of the book which is readable & pleasing to the eye. A book is to select for easy understanding by the majority of the user of the library.A book that is written with flair for simple style, language & clarity of expression should be purchased.

[edit] Second Law: Every reader his or her book
Any patron from the library community should have access to the books in the library. Any person has a right to use the collections housed in the library. There are not certain books or collections that some audiences within the population can not access. Collections should be developed that every part of the population will be interested in.

[edit] Third Law: Every book its reader
This law is about items in the library’s collection, and who uses them. Each book in the library has a member of the community that will find the book useful or interesting. One of the major developments that Ranganathan contributed through this law is the idea that if a book is not being used often it needs exposure to groups of readers who will find it useful.

[edit] Fourth Law: Save the time of the Reader
This law makes it clear that if readers find what they are looking for in a timely manner they will be more satisfied, and more likely to feel like their needs have been met. This not only makes library service more efficient, but also makes the reader feel like their search has been an effective one.

[edit] Fifth Law: The library is a growing organism
This law says that the library is dependent on life and change. Without the human and organizational changes that occur, the library would neither function properly, nor meet its purpose.j

[edit] Variants
In 1998, librarian Michael Gorman (past president of the American Library Association, 2005-2006), recommended the following laws in addition to Ranganathan's five in his small book, "Our Singular Strengths":

Libraries serve humanity.
Respect all forms by which knowledge is communicated.
Use technology intelligently to enhance service.
Protect free access to knowledge.
Honor the past and create the future.

In 2004, librarian Alireza Noruzi recommended applying Ranganathan's laws to the web in his paper, "Application of Ranganathan's Laws to the Web":

Web resources are for use.
Every user has his or her web resource.
Every web resource its user.
Save the time of the user.
The Web is a growing organism.
