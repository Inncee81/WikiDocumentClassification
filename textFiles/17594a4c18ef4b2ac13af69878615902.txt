[edit] Origins
In a "Postmortem" feature on Gamasutra.com[1], Kevin Meredith of IDV recounted SpeedTree as originating due to their lack of satisfaction with 3rd-party plug-ins on the market. The initial version of SpeedTreeCAD (CAD standing for "computer-aided design") was developed by IDV for a real-time golf simulation. Although backers pulled out of the golf project, IDV refined the CAD software as a 3D Studio Max component for an animated architectural rendering. After refining SpeedTreeMAX for retail, IDV went on to produce the real-time version SDK version to much commercial success.

[edit] Components
SpeedTreeRT (RT standing for "real-time") is a software development kit (SDK) written in C++ whose source code is available to licensees. It is intended to be fitted into a larger graphical engine, with the SpeedTree software handling the rendering of trees and foliage alone and the specific product's engine incorporating these into the larger environment.
SpeedTreeCAD is a Windows-based specialized modeling tool created specifically for creating and editing foliage. SpeedTreeCAD permits specification of such variables as branch length, branching angles, bark texture and gravitational influence, and then generates a tree from that information. Trees created in SpeedTreeCAD can be more or less detailed, and consequently can be used for either real-time or prerendered display.
IDV also provides SpeedTreeMAX and SpeedTreeMAYA, plug-ins for the popular 3D Studio Max and Maya modeling programs.

[edit] Licensees
SpeedTreeMAX was launched in February 2002, and SpeedTreeRT was licensed for its first titles, including The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, in December 2002. SpeedTree has been licensed for PC and next-generation console titles in a wide variety of genres by developers including:

This list is incomplete, and may never satisfy certain standards for completion, as many game developers do not reveal their use of middleware, or will not announce the tools they have used until the game is released.

[edit] SpeedTree in Non-Game Applications
SpeedTree has been integrated as an optional module with the Vega Prime visualization product line (official announcement) developed by MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. (now Presagis) prior to its acquisition by CAE in May 2007. Vega Prime is a 3D visual simulation software package used by the global military industry and in other game and non-game markets
In addition, the following non-game projects have been announced by IDV:

An Apache attack helicopter FLIR simulation developed for the US Army by Camber Corp. of Huntsville, Alabama, for pilot training under night flying conditions
A combat simulation developed by Emergent Game Technologies for the US Department of Defense (official announcement).
A project under development by the Germany-based division of European Aeronautic Defence and Space (EADS) (official announcement).
