[edit] Content
Mission statements often contain the following:

Purpose of the organization
The organization's primary stakeholders: clients, stockholders, etc.
Responsibilities of the organization towards these stakeholders
Products and services offered

Generally shorter mission statements are more effective than longer ones.

[edit] Process
In developing a mission statement:

Encourage input as feasible from employees, volunteers, and other stakeholders
Publicize it broadly


[edit] Stakeholder conflict resolution
The mission statement can be used to resolve differences between business stakeholders. Stakeholders include: employees including managers and executives, stockholders, board of directors, customers, suppliers, distributors, creditors, governments (local, state, federal, etc.), unions, competitors, NGO's, and the general public. Stakeholders affect and are affected by the organization's strategies. According to Vern McGinis, a mission should:

Define what the company is
Define what the company aspires to be
Limited to exclude some ventures
Broad enough to allow for creative growth
Distinguish the company from all others
Serve as framework to evaluate current activities
Stated clearly so that it is understood by all


[edit] Wording
Some mission statements are complex, long, and very broad, for example:


“
Since its inception in 1982, La Unidad Latina has remained on the vanguard of political and community empowerment by developing influential leaders that strive to exert knowledge and power into its peers in order to attain mutual success. LUL is committed to academic excellence, leadership development and cultural enlightenment, enhanced by a diverse cognizant membership. LUL strives to preserve and promote an inclusive intellectual environment for its members, in addition to the general community.[1]
”


In contrast, some mission statements are simple and direct, for example:


“
To protect and promote the interests of motorcyclists while serving the needs of its members.[2]
”
