From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data for the purpose of formulating hypotheses worth testing, complementing the tools of conventional statistics for testing hypotheses[1]. It was so named by John Tukey to contrast with Confirmatory Data Analysis, the term used for the set of ideas about hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals etc. which formed the key tools in the arsenal of practicing statisticians at the time.

[edit] EDA development
Tukey held that too much emphasis in statistics was placed on statistical hypothesis testing (confirmatory data analysis); more emphasis needed to be placed on using data to suggest hypotheses to test. In particular, he held that confusing the two types of analyses and employing them on the same set of data can lead to systematic bias owing to the issues inherent in testing hypotheses suggested by the data.
The objectives of EDA are to:

Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena
Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based
Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments

Many EDA techniques have been adopted into data mining and are being taught to young students as a way to introduce them to statistical thinking.[2]

[edit] Techniques
There are a number of tools that are useful for EDA, but EDA is characterized more by the attitude taken than by particular techniques.[3]
The principal graphical techniques used in EDA are:

Box plot
Histogram
MultiVari chart
Run chart
Pareto chart
Scatter plot
Stem-and-leaf plot

The principal quantitative techniques are:

Median polish
the Trimean
Letter values
Resistant line
Resistant smooth
Rootogram

Graphical and quantitative techniques are:

Multidimensional scaling
Ordination


[edit] History
Many EDA ideas can be traced back to earlier authors, for example:

Francis Galton emphasized order statistics and quantiles.
Arthur Bowley used precursors of the stemplot and five-number summary (Bowley actually used a "seven-figure summary", including the extremes, deciles and quartiles, along with the median - see his Elementary Manual of Statistics (3rd edn., 1920), p.62 - he defines "the maximum and minimum, median, quartiles and two deciles" as the "seven positions").
Andrew Ehrenberg articulated a philosophy of data reduction (see his book of the same name).

The Open University course Statistics in Society (MDST 242), took the above ideas and merged them with Gottfried Noether's work, which introduced statistical inference via coin-tossing and the median test.
