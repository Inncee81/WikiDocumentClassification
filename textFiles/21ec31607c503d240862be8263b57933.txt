[edit] Career
Fisk has been described in the New York Times as "probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain." [2] He covered the Northern Ireland Troubles in the 1970s, the Portuguese Revolution in 1974, the 1975-1990 Lebanese Civil War, the 1979 Iranian revolution, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the 1980-88 Iran–Iraq War, the 1991 Gulf War, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He has received numerous awards, including the British Press Awards' International Journalist of the Year award seven times. Fisk speaks vernacular Arabic, and is one of the few Western journalists to have interviewed Osama bin Laden – three times between 1994 and 1997.[3] [4]
Fisk has said that journalism must "challenge authority — all authority — especially so when governments and politicians take us to war." He has quoted with approval the Israeli journalist Amira Hass: "There is a misconception that journalists can be objective ... What journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power." [5]
He has written at length on how much of contemporary conflict has, in his view, its origin in lines drawn on maps: "After the allied victory of 1918, at the end of my father's war, the victors divided up the lands of their former enemies. In the space of just seventeen months, they created the borders of Northern Ireland, Yugoslavia and most of the Middle East. And I have spent my entire career — in Belfast and Sarajevo, in Beirut and Baghdad — watching the people within those borders burn." [6]

[edit] Early career
Fisk received a BA in English Literature at Lancaster University in 1968[7] and a PhD in Political Science, from Trinity College, Dublin in 1985.[8] The title of his doctoral thesis was "A condition of limited warfare: Eire’s neutrality and the relationship between Dublin, Belfast and London, 1939–1945" [8]. He first worked on the Sunday Express diary column before a disagreement with the editor, John Junor, prompted a move to The Times.[9] From 1972-75 Fisk served as Belfast correspondent for The Times, before becoming its correspondent in Portugal covering the aftermath of the Carnation Revolution. He then was appointed Middle East correspondent (1976-1988). When a story of his was spiked after Rupert Murdoch's takeover, he moved to The Independent, with his first report published there on 28 April 1989.
Fisk has been living in Beirut since 1976,[10] and was present in Beirut throughout the Lebanese civil war. He was one of the first journalists to visit the scene of the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, as well as the Syrian Hama Massacre. His book on the Lebanese conflict, Pity the Nation, was first published in 1990. Fisk also reported on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kosovo war and the Algerian civil war.

[edit] The Attacks of September 11, 2001
Fisk condemned the September 11, 2001 attacks, describing them as a "hideous crime against humanity." He immediately called for an "honest discussion" of the motives behind the attacks, a discussion which was not occurring in the Western press.[11] Fisk (among others) contended that it was a response to US policies in the Middle East, particularly its support for Israel,[12] and has scorned President Bush's assertion that the perpetrators of the attacks acted "because they hate our freedom."[13]
In August 2007 Fisk expressed, for the first and only time, personal doubts about the orthodox historical record of the 2001 attacks. In an article for The Independent, he insisted the US government was incapable of successfully carrying out such attacks due to its organisational incompetence, but wrote: "I am increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in the official narrative of 9/11." He proceeded to raise his concerns about a lack of aircraft debris, the melting point of steel, the collapse of World Trade Center 7, misidentified suicide-hijackers and other familiar questions that have circulated within the 9/11 Truth Movement. He added that he does not condone the "crazed 'research' of David Icke [...] I am talking about scientific issues". [14]

[edit] Osama bin Laden and the War in Afghanistan
Fisk is one of the few Western journalists to have interviewed Osama bin Laden - three times (all published by The Independent: December 6, 1993, July 10, 1996, and March 22, 1997). During one of Fisk's interviews with Bin Laden, Fisk noted an attempt by Bin Laden to convert him. Bin Laden said; "Mr Robert, one of our brothers had a dream. He dreamed ... that you were a spiritual person ... this means you are a true Muslim." Fisk replied; "Sheikh Osama, I am not a Muslim ... I am a journalist."[15]
After the US launched its attack on Afghanistan shortly after the 2001 New York attacks, Fisk was for a time transferred to Pakistan to provide coverage of that conflict. While reporting from there, he was attacked and badly beaten by a group of Afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the United States Air Force. He was saved from this attack by another Afghan refugee. In his graphic account of his own beating, published in The Independent of December 10, 2001, Fisk excused the attackers of responsibility ("I couldn't blame them for what they were doing") and pointed out that their "brutality was entirely the product of others, of us — of we who had armed their struggle against the Russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the 'War for Civilisation' just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them 'collateral damage.'"[16] Commenting on the attack Fisk said he could understand the refugees' anger as a natural response to the US invasion. He stated: "They had every reason to be angry - I've been an outspoken critic of the US actions myself. If I had been them, I would have attacked me." [17]

[edit] Iraq War
During the 2003 Iraq War, Fisk was stationed in Baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports. He has criticized other journalists based in Iraq for what he calls their "hotel journalism", literally reporting from one's hotel room without interviews or first hand experience of events.[18] His opposition to the war brought attacks from pro-war supporters such as Irish columnist and Senator Eoghan Harris[19] and Guardian columnist and war supporter Simon Hoggart[20]

[edit] Awards
In 1991, Fisk won a Jacob's Award for his RTÉ Radio coverage of the first Gulf War.[21] He received Amnesty International UK Press Awards in 1998 for his reports from Algeria and again in 2000 for his articles on the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. He received the British Press Awards' International Journalist of the Year seven times, and twice won its "Reporter of the Year" award.[22] In 2001, he was awarded the David Watt Prize for "outstanding contributions towards the clarification of political issues and the promotion of their greater understanding" for his investigation into the Armenian Genocide by the Turks in 1915.[23] In 2002 he was the fourth recipient of the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. More recently, Fisk was awarded the 2006 Lannan Cultural Freedom Prize along with $350,000.[24]
He was made an honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of St Andrews on June 24, 2004. The Political and Social Sciences department of Ghent University (Belgium) awarded Fisk an honorary doctorate on March 24, 2006. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the American University of Beirut in June 2006. Trinity College Dublin awarded him a second, honorary, Doctorate in July 2008.[25]

[edit] "Fisking"
Main article: Fisking
Alleged biases and inaccuracies in Fisk's reporting has led one section of the blogosphere to spawn the term fisking.[26] This refers not to what Fisk does, but to what is done to those who, like him, are being challenged — the fisker begins by copying text from the fiskee, and then produces an interlinear critique pointing out flaws and raising doubts. This technique has been criticized as a one-sided posting style in which "the fisker can without too much trouble make the fiskee look ridiculous."[27] The term originates from criticisms of Fisk[28] but has been extended to others.[29]

[edit] Books and other works
Fisk has published a number of books. His 2005 work, "The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East", with its criticism of Western and Israeli approaches to the Middle East, was well-received by critics and students of international affairs, and is perhaps his best-known work.
