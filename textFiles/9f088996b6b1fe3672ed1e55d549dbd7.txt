[edit] History
The original CamStudio was released by RenderSoft[1]. A succession of acquisitions led to the company being owned by Macromedia (who have themselves now been taken over by Adobe). Macromedia continued the development of their own software based on CamStudio called Robodemo (now called Adobe Captivate[2]). Their product remained available under a proprietary software license only. Development of CamStudio 2.0 (the last open-source version) was resumed and released as free software again in September 2007 with the CamStudio 2.5 Beta 1 release. Accordingly, it was re-branded as CamStudio Open Source. The project is currently seeking developers.
