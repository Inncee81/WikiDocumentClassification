In linguistics, an eggcorn is an idiosyncratic substitution of a word or phrase for a word or words that sound similar or identical in the speaker's dialect. The new phrase introduces a meaning that is different from the original, but plausible in the same context ("old-timers' disease" for "Alzheimer's disease"). This is as opposed to a malapropism, where the substitution creates a nonsensical phrase. Classical malapropisms generally derive their comic effect from the fault of the user, whilst eggcorns are errors that exhibit creativity or logic.[1] Eggcorns often involve replacing an unfamiliar, archaic, or obscure word with a more common or modern word ("baited breath" for "bated breath").[2]

[edit] Creation and definition
The term "eggcorn" was coined by Geoffrey Pullum in September 2003, in response to an article by Mark Liberman on the website Language Log, a blog for linguists.[3] Liberman discussed the case of a woman who substitutes the phrase egg corn for the word acorn, arguing that the precise phenomenon lacked a name; Pullum suggested using "eggcorn" itself.
While there are several similar classes of linguistic deviation which have been recognised for longer, Liberman argues that the original "egg corn" does not fit any of them:

It is not a folk etymology: it is an error made by an individual, rather than an entire community over time.
It is not a malapropism: egg corn and acorn are nearly homophonous in the dialect in question, while malapropisms feature only vaguely similar words.
It is not a mondegreen: it is an error of misinterpretation from common speech rather than from a lyric or similar recitation, and also does not acquire an entirely new meaning.


[edit] Examples

for all intensive purposes instead of for all intents and purposes[4]
hone in instead of home in[5]
just desserts instead of just deserts[6]
old timers' disease instead of Alzheimer's disease [7]
on tenderhooks instead of on tenterhooks[8]
on the spurt of the moment instead of on the spur of the moment[1]
once and a while instead of once in a while[9]
pot marks instead of pockmarks [10]
preying mantis instead of praying mantis[11]
sore grapes instead of sour grapes[12]
splashy instead of plashy[13]
tow the line instead of toe the line[14]
wanton to do instead of wont to do [15] [10]

A fairly extensive list of Eggcorn examples can be found at the Eggcorn Database.
