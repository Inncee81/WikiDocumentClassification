From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Subversion has its own command-line client. Other clients are available, which are perhaps easier or more intuitive to use in different scenarios. Often, people have several clients installed, and use each for different tasks[citation needed].
A large list of third-party Subversion clients is available at: http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html#clients
TortoiseSVN is a Windows shell extension, which gives feedback on the state of versioned items by adding overlays to the icons in the Windows Explorer. Repository commands can be executed from the enhanced context menu provided by Tortoise. SmartSVN provides a similar Explorer integration, but also can be used as a standalone SVN client for different platforms.
Some programmers prefer to have a client integrated within their development environment. Again, visual feedback of the state of versioned items is provided, and repository commands are added to the menus of the development environment. Examples of this approach are Agent SVN, AnkhSVN, Unified SCC and VisualSVN for use with Microsoft Visual Studio, and Subclipse for use with Eclipse.
It is common to expose Subversion via Webdav using the Apache web server. In this case, any Webdav client can be used, but the functionality provided this way is limited. An alternative is WebSVN written in PHP or VisualSVN server, which offers a wider functionality.

[edit] Descriptions of Clients
Agent SVN is an implementation of the (MS-SCCI) for the Subversion version control. The plug-in allows files to be added, removed, checked out, checked in and reverted without leaving the IDE. File differences, status and history can also be viewed from within the IDE.
KDESVN A feature-rich client with great history and revision views, annotated code views showing who changed each line of code and when it was changed, and 3D graphical views of branching and merging among trees. Written in C++ with QT, but using KDE libraries so it’s not portable to Windows.
NautilusSvn A Python extension to integrate Subversion functionality into the Nautilus File Manager, basically as a clone of the TortoiseSVN project on Windows.
SVNCOM Not actually a client itself, it is actually an API built over SVN’s native C API. It uses COM objects that make it easier to develop Windows based applications or scripts which use SVN. One COM object represents an SVN Client, the other represents an SVN Administrator. The COM objects make it easy to automate tasks in the Windows Scripting Environment or .NET
WebSVN Offering an online view of a repository, history, and commit comments, as well as opening code in a syntax colored view. The code view is not editable, at least in the demo. Also allows you to view the difference between versions of a file or directory. Written in PHP and opens in a browser.
