Last stand is a loose military term used to describe a body of troops holding a defensive position in the face of overwhelming odds. The defensive force usually takes very heavy casualties or is completely destroyed, while also inflicting high casualties on the opponent. Apart from rare exceptions, such as Rorke's Drift, Battle of Longewala, and Battle of Little Big Horn the defending force is usually annihilated.
The situation can arise in one of two ways. One situation is that retreat by the defending force would lead to immediate defeat, usually due to the surrounding geography or shortage of supplies or support. The other situation arises when the defending force are ordered to defend their positions, thus retreat is not possible without being considered a deserter. In both cases, surrender is usually an alternative option. However, surrender is only possible through order of the commanding personnel or if the defending force collectively agrees to surrender; in both cases the attacking army will have to agree to the surrender, if it doesn't or the defender is convinced it won't, this again leads to the last stand situation.
Despite any preceding circumstances, a last stand is a last resort tactic, and is chosen because the defending force realizes the benefits of fighting outweigh the benefits of retreat or surrender. This usually arises from strategic or moral considerations, leading defenders to conclude that their sacrifice is essential to the greater success of their campaign or cause.
A siege will often lead to a last stand by the defenders of the besieged city. However, while sieges are generally characterised by a lengthy engagement, last stands are generally brief and decisive.

Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu was fleeing to India with his men together with thousands of refugees from Persia, following the Mongol sacking of several cities, including Bukhara and Samarkand, the latter being the Khwarezmian capital. After having won the Battle of Parwan, near the city Ghazna (Ghazni) in eastern Persia, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu headed for India to seek refuge together with his army of some fifty thousand men and several thousand refugees. However, the horde of Genghis Khan caught up with him when he was about to cross the river Indus. The sultan posted most of his men in the way of the Mongols to let him and the refugees pass the river in safety. When the army who awaited the enemy was busy fighting the Mongolian vanguard, Genghis Khan led the main force towards the sultan who was trapped between the Mongols and the river.

1:5
In 1385, a Castilian offensive (against the advice of Castilian counselors) would face the Portuguese in a battle which ultimately proved to be decisive when both armies formed between two rivulets south of Calvaria, which formed a kind of trapeze, with Castilians in the base, and Portuguese in the smaller "roof". The Portuguese had dismounted and formed a defensive line. Being too late in the day, the Castilian king decided to stand by and wait. The Portuguese only would have two possibilities: to attack and be defeated, or to stand by, and, without provisions and, facing the Castilians numerical superiority, suffer the probable desertions at night. Anyway, the youngest Castilian knights, thinking it was a cowardly tactic, started the fight, before receiving this order. All the Castilian line joined an uncoordinated assault, which was completely crushed by English arrows and Portuguese infantry. An action of the cavalry of Alcántara (commanded by Gonzalo Núñez de Guzmán) allowed a posterior Castilian retreat, preventing Portuguese counterattack, but the Portuguese victory was complete.





Defence of Meerut Fort

It was only after the death of Awaan that Tamerlane's army was able to take the fort. Tamerlane developed great respect for Awaan and openely praised his bravery and courage. He later mentioned Awaan in his memoirs as the opponent who gave him the fiercest resistance with an extremely small force.

By September, the Ottoman camp was in disarray, as morale sank and disease ran rampant. The Ottoman army acknowledged that the castle of Krujë would not fall by strength of arms, and lifted the siege and made their way to Edirne.





Fall of Constantinople
May 1453
7,000 Byzantines and Latin allies
80,000-200,000 Ottomans[7]

Constantinople was captured by the Turks under Mehmed II after a two-month siege. On May 28, 1453 the Turks stormed the city. Though the Byzantines and their Western allies held off the first two waves of the Turks, the third wave broke through. Emperor Constantine XI, seeing that the battle was lost, begged his fellow soldiers to kill him: "the city is fallen but I yet live, isn't there a Christian here to take my head?" When his soldiers refused to, he stripped off his imperial insignia, and, sword in hand, fought to the death like a common foot soldier.

The city of Rome fell, after a hard fought battle, to the unruly army of Charles V, who had lost all control of his men. On May 6, 1527 the mercenaries and cuthroats of Charles' army stormed the walls of Vatican Hill and began to slaughter what was left of the defenders. After executing a number of men, the bulk of the raiders made their way to St. Peter's Basilica with the intent of looting Christianity's finest treasures. In order to buy time for Pope Clement VII to escape through a secret passage to the relative safety of Castel Sant'Angelo, the Papal Swiss Guard formed up on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica itself and fought for some time against the hordes of men attempting to enter the church. Of the 189 members of the Guard on duty that day, only 42 survived the brutal fighting. The Captain of the Guard was among the fallen. The occupation of Rome by the unruly forces of Charles V lasted for almost nine months.

Ottomans chose to besiege Maltese islands in order to later invade Italy after conquering Malta. The Knights Hospitaller made a last stand to provide time for the Christian to kingdoms prepare for the Ottoman threat. The main mistake of the Ottomans was failure to attack the biggest Maltese forts, Fort Saint Angelo and Fort Saint Michael, instead exhausting their force taking Fort St. Elmo and Birgu. After a 115-day long siege, due to heavy losses in troops and morale, the Ottoman army ultimately retreated to the sea.





Battle of Szigetvár

150 Marathas under Baji Prabhu Deshpande
Bijapuri Army (15,000+)
1:100
Baji Prabhu Deshpande defended Pavan Khind, a small pass and huge cliffs between Kolhapur and Satara, with 150 men against the Bijapur army for more than 14 hours, allowing Shivaji to escape to a safer place.

The Federal cavalry officer and hero of Gettysburg refused an extra battalion of men from General Terry and left a battery of Gatling guns at the Steamboat Far West on the Yellowstone River, knowing he was facing superior odds. Four days later he stumbled upon a very large encampment, 3.5-5 miles long on the west side of the Little Bighorn. His Crow scouts rode off at that point. Custer then divided his forces in a three-way pincers move. The defenders beat back the initial attacks, forced Custer's supporting columns under Reno and Benteen into a defensive position, and pursued Custer and his men up onto a long, open ridge. The entire force with Custer died. Reno and Benteen's men, dug in over three miles (5 km) away, survived a three-day siege until relieved by General Terry.

The longest siege in British history, it proved the tanks vulnerability against anti-tank mines, entrenched infantry and artillery fire. A total of three attempts were made to relieve the siege. Despite the numerical and armory advantage of the Axis, the defenders were able to hold due to the naval superiority of the Royal Navy; not only supplies, but the British 70th Infantry Division and the Polish Carpathian Brigade were able to replace the Australian 9th Division and a brigade of 18th Division. The siege also saw a number of Indians and Czech.

After a 16-day siege, several unsuccessful landing attempts, the loss of two destroyers and nearly 30 aircraft, and extensive damage to its landing fleet, the Japanese succeeded in getting USMC Maj. Devereux to surrender "honorably". The Japanese lost an estimated 900 dead and over 1100 wounded. 49 US Marines, 3 naval personnel, and 70 civilian workers died. Most of the American survivors either died as POWs or were murdered by the Japanese after the surrender, for bringing disgrace on his Imperial Majesty's forces. 98 Americans were kept on the island as slave labor, but were eventually machine-gunned en masse in October 1943. One survivor who escaped the massacre scratched a monument to the dead on a coral rock reading: 98 US PW 5-10-43. He was later recaptured and personally beheaded by Admiral Sakaibara.

The 1st British Airborne Division was charged with securing and holding the bridge--the final bridgehead leading into Germany--against anticipated light opposition until Field Marshal Montgomery's heavy armoured divisions could arrive to relieve them. Allied aerial reconnaissance never identified the two understrength German Panzer divisions resting in the area and Montgomery's troops never got there. Once the Paratroopers had seized the bridge, the Germans counterattacked in force, eventually forcing the bridge, and fighting it out with Britain's crack parachutists in three brutal days of house-to-house fighting while suffering heavy casualties themselves. In the end, about 1000 were evacuated, with the rest of the survivors wounded or captured. The 1st British Airborne suffered 90% casualties.

Completely surrounded by the Germans on December 22, the 101st could only be sustained by airdrops from C-47s. When the German commander, General Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz asked the 101st's acting commander, Anthony McAuliffe to surrender, McAuliffe's famously terse reply was "Nuts!". Nonetheless, the unit held off a German Panzer division, until eventually relieved by George S. Patton's US Third Army on December 26.

About 30,000 U.S. and British soldiers
60,000 Chinese.
Roughly 1:2
UN forces were surrounded by China's People's Liberation Army units. USMC Maj. Gen. O.P. Smith had planned for the contingency, and ordered a fighting retreat by the US' 1st Marine Division. It cut his way out, bringing out all his dead and wounded, and leaving the remnants of 4 shattered Chinese divisions in his path. In contrast, the Army's Task Force Faith failed to break out.





Battle of the Imjin River

Outpost Harry was a strategic "military Hot Spot" and dearly desired by the Chinese. If the UN forces lost the outpost, the U.S. Eighth Army would have had to withdraw approximately 6 miles (10 km) to the next defensible line. Furthermore, a Chinese victory at Outpost Harry may have whet the appetite for more war and disheartened the American public to a point where it might have accepted an armistice term less favorable than was eventually was the case. The United Nations held the position and it was the last battle of the Korean War.

The first attack came at 15:30 on January 7 and was followed by 11 more attacks until just before dawn on January 8 when the Mujahideen withdrew leaving Hill 3234 in the hands of the Soviet paratroopers. Ironically, the exhausted and mostly wounded Soviets were nearly out of ammunition after the final attack and may not have been able to withstand a 13th assault.
The Soviet forces sustained 37 casualties (out of a force of 39 men), including 9 men killed and 28 injured.
