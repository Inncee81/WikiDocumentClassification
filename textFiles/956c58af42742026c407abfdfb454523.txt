[edit] History
Many groups in the post-punk era adopted a more rhythmic tempo, conducive to dancing. These bands were influenced by disco, funk, and other dance musics popular at the time, as well as being anticipated by some of the 1970s work of David Bowie,[3] Brian Eno, and Iggy Pop, and some recordings by the German groups referred to as Krautrock. Groups of influence from the 1980s included The Clash,[4] Public Image Ltd.,[5][6] Gang of Four,[7][2][6] New Order,[8] The Slits, Billy Idol, The Fall, Killing Joke,[9] The Cure,[10] Siouxsie and the Banshees,[11] and Sigue Sigue Sputnik. New York City dance-punk included Material,[12] the B-52's, Blondie, James Chance and the Contortions,[2] Cristina Monet, ESG, Liquid Liquid, and Talking Heads.[13] German punk singer Nina Hagen had an underground dance hit in 1983 with "New York New York", which mixed her searing punk (and opera) vocals with disco beats.[2] Dance-punk scenes also developed in Germany (Neue Deutsche Welle), France (coldwave), and in Brazil. Early dance-punk has significant overlap with synthpop, electropop, new wave, art punk, and some Gothic rock.
As techno and house became popular in the '80s and '90s, some post-punk bands became influenced by this genre. The Madchester groups of the late 1980s, such as the Happy Mondays, pursued a form of Alternative rock inflected by the rave scene.[14] This development was largely appropriated by Britpop groups, such as Blur, and to some degree by Big beat electronica.[14]
The music style known as dance-punk appeared at the beginning of the 21st century.[6] The style was championed by rock- and punk-oriented bands such as Liars, The Rapture and Radio 4, as well as dance-oriented acts such as Out Hud. Other groups, such as !!! and The Faint fell somewhere in the middle. There has since been a crystallization of musical forms within dance-punk, with bands such as Death from Above 1979, Test Icicles, Fake Shark - Real Zombie!, and Q and Not U exploring aspects of dance-punk, along with post-hardcore and other musical styles. DFA Records can be seen as the current center of the dance-punk genre. As well as James Murphy's LCD Soundsystem, the label is currently home to The Juan MacLean, Hot Chip, Hercules & Love Affair, Brinvonda, Shit Robot, Delia Gonzalez & Gavin Russom, Prinzhorn Dance School, Booji Boy High, Shocking Pinks, Holy Ghost!, Still Going, Syclops and YACHT.
A recent British offshoot is the newly-coined term New Rave (evoking both "new wave" and "rave").[15]
