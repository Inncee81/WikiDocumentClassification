Don Tapscott (born 1947) is a Canadian business executive, author, consultant and speaker based in Toronto, Ontario, specializing in business strategy, organizational transformation and the role of technology in business and society. Tapscott is chairman of business strategy think tank New Paradigm (now nGenera), which he founded in 1993. Tapscott is also Adjunct Professor of Management at the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.[1]
Tapscott holds a B.Sc. in Psychology and Statistics, and an M.Ed. specializing in Research Methodology. He also holds two honorary Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) granted by the University of Alberta in 2001, and Trent University in 2006.[2][3] While earning his Master's of Education at the University of Alberta, he ran for mayor of Edmonton in the 1977 municipal election.[4] [5]
Tapscott has authored or co-authored eleven books on the application of technology in business and society. His most famous book, co-authored with Anthony Williams and published in 2006 is Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything (with an expanded edition to be published in April 2008). His penultimate book, co-authored with David Ticoll in 2003 is The Naked Corporation: How the Age of Transparency Will Revolutionize Business. The Naked Corporation describes how corporate transparency, accountability, and stakeholder relationships are the new frontier for competitive innovation.
He has also co-authored, Digital Capital: Harnessing the Power of Business Webs. This book describes how business webs are replacing the traditional model of the firm and changing the dynamics of wealth creation and competition. His popular 1997 book Growing Up Digital: The Rise of the Net Generation explained the business and social impact of the first generation to come of age in the digital age. Digital Economy: Promise and Peril In The Age of Networked Intelligence, published in 1995, was one of the first books to describe how the Internet would change business and society. Tapscott is probably best known for his 1992 book Paradigm Shift: The New Promise of Information Technology.
Tapscott lives in Toronto.
