Vector calculus (or vector analysis) is a branch of mathematics concerned with differentiation and integration of vector fields. The term "vector calculus" is sometimes used as a synonym for the broader subject of multivariable calculus, which includes vector calculus as well as partial differentiation and multiple integration. Vector calculus plays an important role in differential geometry and in the study of partial differential equations. It is used extensively in physics and engineering, especially in the description of electromagnetic, gravitational fields and fluid flow
Vector calculus was developed from quaternion analysis by J. Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside near the end of the 19th century, and most of the notation and terminology was established by Gibbs and Wilson in their 1901 book, Vector Analysis.

[edit] Vector operations
Vector calculus studies various differential operators defined on scalar or vector fields, which are typically expressed in terms of the del operator (). The four most important operations in vector calculus are:


Operation
Notation
Description
Domain/Range


Gradient

Measures the rate and direction of change in a scalar field.
Maps scalar fields to vector fields.


Curl

Measures the tendency to rotate about a point in a vector field.
Maps vector fields to vector fields.


Divergence

Measures the magnitude of a source or sink at a given point in a vector field.
Maps vector fields to scalar fields.


Laplacian

A composition of the divergence and gradient operations.
Maps scalar fields to scalar fields.


A quantity called the Jacobian is useful for studying functions when both the domain and range of the function are multivariable, such as a change of variables during integration.

[edit] Theorems
Likewise, there are several important theorems related to these operators which generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus to higher dimensions:


Theorem
Statement
Description


Gradient theorem

The line integral through a gradient (vector) field equals the difference in its scalar field at the endpoints of the curve.


Green's theorem

The integral of the scalar curl of a vector field over some region in the plane equals the line integral of the vector field over the curve bounding the region.


Stokes' theorem

The integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface equals the line integral of the vector field over the curve bounding the surface.


Divergence theorem

The integral of the divergence of a vector field over some solid equals the integral of the flux through the surface bounding the solid.


The use of vector calculus may require the handedness of the coordinate system to be taken into account (see cross product and handedness for more detail). Most of the analytic results are easily understood, in a more general form, using the machinery of differential geometry, of which vector calculus forms a subset.
