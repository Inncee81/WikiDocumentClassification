Occupation
Leader, Peoples Temple


James Warren "Jim" Jones (May 13, 1931 – November 18, 1978) was the founder of the Peoples Temple, which is best known for the November 18, 1978 death of over 900 Temple members in Jonestown, Guyana along with the deaths of nine other people at a nearby airstrip in Georgetown.
Jones was born in Indiana and started the Temple in that state in the 1950s. Jones and the Temple later moved to California, and both gained notoriety with the move of the Temple's headquarters to San Francisco in the mid-1970s.
To the extent the actions in Jonestown were viewed as a mass suicide, it is one of the largest such mass suicides in history, and the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the events of September 11, 2001. One of those who died at the nearby airstrip was Leo Ryan, who became the only Congressman murdered in the line of duty in the history of the United States.

[edit] Early life




Lynetta Putnam Jones, the mother of Jim Jones


Jim Jones was born in Crete, Indiana, a rural community near the Ohio border,[1] to James Thurman Jones (May 31, 1887 – May 29, 1951), a World War I veteran, and Lynetta Putnam (April 16, 1902 – December 11, 1977).[2] He would later claim part Cherokee descent through his mother, though this was likely false.[3][note 1] Economic difficulties during the Great Depression necessitated that Jones' family move to nearby Lynn, Indiana in 1934.[4] Jim Jones and, later, a journalism professor who grew up in Lynn both claimed that Jones' father was in the Ku Klux Klan.[4]
In interviews for the 2007 documentary Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple, childhood acquaintances recalled Jones as being a "really weird kid" who was "obsessed with religion ... obsessed with death", and claimed that he frequently held funerals for small animals, and had purportedly fatally stabbed a cat.[5]
Jones was a voracious reader as a child and studied Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi and Adolf Hitler carefully,[6] noting each of their strengths and weaknesses.[6] After Jones' parents separated, he moved with his mother to Richmond, Indiana.[7] Jones graduated from Richmond High School early and with honors in December 1948.[8]
Jones married Marceline Baldwin, a nurse, in 1949 and moved to Bloomington, Indiana.[9] Jones attended Indiana University at Bloomington, where a speech by Eleanor Roosevelt about the plight of African Americans impressed him.[9] Jones' sympathetic statements about communism offended Marceline's grandmother.[9] In 1951, Jones moved to Indianapolis, where he attended night school at Butler University, earning a degree in secondary education in 1961.[10]

[edit] Indiana beginnings
Further information: Peoples Temple
In 1951, Jones became a member of the Communist Party USA, and began attending meetings and rallies in Indianapolis.[11] Jones became flustered with harassment he received during the McCarthy Hearings,[11] particularly regarding meetings between Jones and his mother with Paul Robeson.[12] He also became frustrated with what he perceived to be ostracism of open communists in the United States, especially during the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.[13] This frustration, among other things, provoked a seminal moment for Jones in which he asked himself "how can I demonstrate my Marxism? The thought was, infiltrate the church."[12][11]
Jones' interest in religion began during his childhood, primarily because he found making friends difficult, though initially he vacillated on his church of choice.[3] Jones was surprised when a Methodist superintendent helped Jones to get a start in the church even though he knew Jones to be a communist and Jones did not meet him through the American Communist Party.[13] In 1952, Jones became a student pastor in Sommerset Southside Methodist Church, but left that church because its leaders barred him from integrating blacks into his congregation.[11] Around this time, Jones witnessed a faith-healing service at the Seventh Day Baptist Church.[11] He observed that it attracted people and their money and concluded that, with financial resources from such healings, he could help accomplish his social goals.[11]
Jones then began his own church, which changed names until it became the Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel.[11] Jones sold pet monkeys door-to-door to raise funds for his church.[14]
Jones moved away from the American Communist Party and Maoists when ACP members and Mao Zedong became critical of some of former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's policies.[13]

[edit] Integrationist
In 1960, Indianapolis Democratic Mayor Charles Boswell appointed Jones as a director of the Human Rights Commission.[15] Jones ignored Boswell's advice to keep a low profile, finding new outlets for his views on local radio and television programs.[15] When the mayor and other commissioners asked Jones to curtail his public actions, Jones resisted and was wildly cheered at a meeting of the NAACP and Urban League when he yelled for his audience to be more militant, and climaxed with "Let my people go!"[16]
During this time, Jones also helped to integrate churches, restaurants, the telephone company, the police department, a theater, an amusement park, and the Methodist Hospital.[11] After swastikas were painted on the homes of two African American families, Jones personally walked the neighborhood comforting African Americans and counseling white families not to move, in order to prevent white flight.[17] Jones set up stings to catch restaurants refusing to serve African American customers.[17] Jones wrote to American Nazi leaders and then leaked their responses to the media.[18] When Jones was accidentally placed in the black ward of a hospital after a collapse in 1961, Jones refused to be moved and began to make the beds, and empty the bed pans, of black patients.[19] Political pressures resulting from Jones' actions caused hospital officials to desegregate the wards.[19]
Jones received considerable criticism in Indiana for his integrationist views.[11] White owned businesses and locals were critical of him.[17] A swastika was placed on the Temple, a stick of dynamite was left in a Temple coal pile and a dead cat was thrown at Jones' house after a threatening phone call.[18] Other incidents occurred, though some suspect that Jones himself may have been involved in at least some of them.[18]

[edit] "Rainbow family"




Brochure of the Peoples Temple, portraying leader Jim Jones as the father of the "Rainbow Family."


Jim and Marceline Jones adopted several children of at least partial non-Caucasian ancestry; he referred to the clan as his "rainbow family,"[20] and stated: "Integration is a more personal thing with me now. It's a question of my son's future."[21] That comported with Jones' portrayal of the Temple overall as a "rainbow family."
The couple adopted three children of Korean-American ancestry: Lew, Suzanne and Stephanie. Jones had been encouraging Temple members to adopt orphans from war ravaged Korea.[22] Jones had long been critical of the United States' opposition to communist leader Kim Il-Sung's 1950 invasion of South Korea, calling it the "war of liberation" and stating that "the south is a living example of all that socialism in the north has overcome."[23] In 1954, he and his wife also adopted Agnes Jones, who was partly of Native American descent.[21][24] Agnes was 11 at the time of her adoption.[25] Suzanne Jones was adopted at the age of six in 1959.[25] In June 1959, the couple had their only biological child, Stephan Gandhi Jones.[24]
Two years later, in 1961, the Joneses became the first white couple in Indiana to adopt an African American child, James Warren Jones, Jr.[26] Marceline was once spat upon while she carried Jim Jr. [18]
The couple also adopted another son, who was white, named Tim.[24] Tim Jones, whose birth mother was a member of the Peoples Temple, was originally named Timothy Glen Tupper.[21]

Jones' Brazil locations

After a 1961 Temple speech about nuclear apocalypse,[19] and a January 1962 Esquire Magazine article listing Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as a safe place in a nuclear war, Jones traveled with his family to the Brazilian city with the idea of setting up a new Temple location.[27]
On his way to Brazil, Jones made his first trip into Guyana.[28] After arriving in Belo Horizonte, the Joneses rented a modest three bedroom home.[29] Jones studied the local economy and receptiveness of racial minorities to his message, though language remained a barrier.[30] Jones was careful to not portray himself as a communist in foreign territory, and spoke of an apostolic communal lifestyle rather than of Castro or Marx.[31]
After becoming frustrated with the lack of resources in the locale, in mid-1963, the Joneses moved to Rio de Janeiro.[32] There, they worked with the poor in Rio's slums.[32] Jones also explored local Brazilian religion. [33]
Jones was plagued by guilt for leaving behind the Indiana civil rights struggle and possibly losing what he had struggled to build there.[32] When Jones' associate preachers in Indiana told him that the Temple was about to collapse without him, Jones returned.[34]

After Jones' return to Indiana from Brazil, in 1965, Jones claimed that the world would be engulfed in a nuclear war on July 15, 1967, that would then create a new socialist Eden on earth, and that the Temple must move to Northern California for safety.[35][11] Accordingly, the Temple began moving to Redwood Valley, California.[11]
While Jones always spoke of the social gospel's virtues, before the late 1960s Jones chose to conceal that his gospel was actually communism.[11] By the late 1960s, Jones began at least partially openly revealing in Temple sermons his "Apostolic Socialism" concept.[11] Specifically, "those who remained drugged with the opiate of religion had to be brought to enlightenment -- socialism."[36] Jones often mixed those concepts, such as preaching that "If you're born in capitalist America, racist America, fascist America, then you're born in sin. But if you're born in socialism, you're not born in sin."[37]
By the early 1970s, Jones began deriding traditional Christianity as "fly away religion," rejecting the Bible as being white men’s' justification to subordinate women and subjugate people of color and stating that it spoke of a "Sky God" who was no God at all.[11] Jones authored a booklet titled "The Letter Killeth," criticizing the Bible.[38] Jones also began preaching that he was the reincarnation of Jesus of Nazareth, Mahatma Gandhi, Buddha, Vladimir Lenin, and Father Divine. In the documentary Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple, former Temple member Hue Fortson, Jr. quoted Jones as saying, "What you need to believe in is what you can see...If you see me as your friend, I'll be your friend. As you see me as your father, I'll be your father, for those of you that don't have a father...If you see me as your savior, I'll be your savior. If you see me as your God, I'll be your God."[39]
By the Spring of 1976, Jones began openly admitting even to outsiders that he was an atheist.[40] Despite the Temple's fear that the IRS was investigating its religious tax exemption, by 1977 Marceline Jones admitted to the New York Times that, as early as age 18 when he watched his then idol Mao Zedong overthrow the Chinese government, Jim Jones realized that the way to achieve social change through Marxism in the United States was to mobilize people through religion.[35] She stated that "Jim used religion to try to get some people out of the opiate of religion," and had slammed the Bible on the table yelling "I've got to destroy this paper idol!" [35] In one sermon, Jones said that, "You're gonna help yourself, or you'll get no help! There's only one hope of glory; that's within you! Nobody's gonna come out of the sky! There's no heaven up there! We'll have to make heaven down here!"[41]

[edit] Move to San Francisco
Main article: Peoples Temple in San Francisco




Seal of the San Francisco Housing Authority


The move of Peoples Temple headquarters to San Francisco in 1975 invigorated Jones' political career. After the Temple served an important role in the mayoral election victory of George Moscone in 1975, Moscone appointed Jones as the Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission.[42]
Unlike most other figures deemed as cult leaders, Jones was able to gain public support and contact with prominent local and national United States politicians. For example, Jones and Moscone met privately with vice presidential candidate Walter Mondale on his campaign plane days before the 1976 election and Mondale publicly praised the Temple.[43][44] First Lady Rosalynn Carter also personally met with Jones on multiple occasions, corresponded with him about Cuba, and spoke with him at the grand opening of the San Francisco Democratic Party Headquarters where Jones garnered louder applause than Mrs. Carter.[43][45][46]
In September 1976, Willie Brown served as master of ceremonies at a large testimonial dinner for Jones attended by Governor Jerry Brown and Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Dymally and other political figures.[47] At that dinner, while introducing Jones, Willie Brown stated "Let me present to you what you should see every day when you look in the mirror in the early morning hours ... Let me present to you a combination of Martin King, Angela Davis, Albert Einstein ... Chairman Mao."[48] Harvey Milk, who spoke at political rallies at the Temple,[49] and wrote to Jones after a visit to the Temple: "Rev Jim, It may take me many a day to come back down from the high that I reach today. I found something dear today. I found a sense of being that makes up for all the hours and energy placed in a fight. I found what you wanted me to find. I shall be back. For I can never leave."[50][51]
In his San Francisco Temple apartment, Jones regularly hosted San Francisco radical political figures such as Angela Davis for discussions.[52] He spoke with friend and San Francisco Sun-Reporter publisher Dr. Carlton Goodlett about Jones' remorse regarding not being able to travel to socialist countries such as China and the Soviet Union, speculating that he could be Chief Dairyman of the Soviet Union.[53] After his criticisms caused increased tensions with the Nation of Islam, Jones spoke at a huge rally healing the rift between the two groups in the Los Angeles Convention center attended by many of Jones' closest political acquaintances.[54]
While Jones forged media alliances with key columnists and others at the San Francisco Chronicle and other media outlets,[55] the move to San Francisco also brought increasing media scrutiny. After Chronicle reporter Marshall Kilduff encountered resistance to publishing an expose, he brought his story to New West Magazine.[56] In the summer of 1977, Jones and several hundred Temple members moved to the Temple's "Agricultural Project" in Guyana after they learned of the contents of Kilduff's article to be published in which former Temple members claimed they were physically, emotionally, and sexually abused.[57][46] Jones named the settlement Jonestown after himself.

Jones had first started building Jonestown in 1974 as a means to create both a "socialist paradise" and a "sanctuary" from the media scrutiny which had started in 1972.[58] Regarding the former goal, Jones purported to establish Jonestown as a benevolent model communist community stating, "I believe we’re the purest communists there are."[59] In that regard, like the restrictive emigration policies of the then Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea and other communist republics, Jones did not permit members to leave Jonestown.[60]
Religious scholar Mary McCormick Maaga argues that Jones' authority waned after he moved to the isolated commune, because he was not needed for recruitment and he could not hide his drug addiction from rank and file members.[61] In spite of the allegations prior to Jones' departure to Jonestown, the leader was still respected by some for setting up a racially mixed church which helped the disadvantaged; 68 percent of Jonestown's residents were black.[62]

[edit] New children

Jim Jones claimed that he was the biological father of John Victor Stoen, although the birth certificate lists Grace and Timothy Stoen as the parents of the boy.[63] The Temple repeatedly claimed that Jones fathered the child when, in 1971, Temple member Tim Stoen had requested that Jones have sex with Grace Stoen to keep her from defecting.[64] After Grace Stoen later defected in 1976 and began divorce proceedings against Tim Stoen in 1977, in order to avoid potentially giving up the boy in a custody dispute with Grace, Jones ordered Tim to take John to Guyana in February 1977.[65]
After purported father Tim Stoen defected from the Temple in June 1977, the Temple kept John Stoen in Jonestown.[66] The custody dispute over John Stoen would become a linchpin of several battles between the Temple and the Concerned Relatives.[67]
Jim Jones also fathered a son, Jim Jon (Kimo), with Carolyn Louise Moore Layton, a Temple member.[68]

[edit] Pressure and waning political support
Further information: Timothy Stoen and Peoples Temple in San Francisco
While most of Jones' political allies broke ties after Jones' departure,[69] some did not. As a show of support, Willie Brown spoke out against enemies at a rally at the Peoples Temple, also attended by Harvey Milk and Art Agnos.[70] Most importantly for Jones and the Temple, Moscone's office shortly thereafter issued a press release saying that Jones had broken no laws.[71]







In the Fall of 1977, Tim Stoen and other relatives in Jonestown formed a "Concerned Relatives" group.[72] Stoen traveled to Washington D.C. in January 1978 to visit with Congressmen, including Leo Ryan and State Department officials, and wrote a "white paper" to Congress detailing the dispute and pressing for Congressional correspondence.[73] Stoen's efforts aroused the curiosity of Ryan, who wrote a letter on Stoen's behalf to Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham.[74]
Amidst growing pressure in the United States to investigate the Temple, on February 19, 1978, Harvey Milk wrote a letter of support for the Peoples Temple to President Jimmy Carter.[75][76][77] Therein, Milk wrote that Jones was known "as a man of the highest character."[77] Regarding the leader of those attempting to extricate relatives from Jonestown, Milk wrote he was "attempting to damage Rev. Jones reputation" with "apparent bold-faced lies."[77]
On April 11, 1978, the Concerned Relatives distributed a packet of documents, including letters and affidavits, that they titled an "Accusation of Human Rights Violations by Rev. James Warren Jones" to the Peoples Temple, members of the press and members of Congress.[78] In June 1978, escaped Temple member Deborah Layton provided the group with a further affidavit detailing alleged crimes by the Peoples Temple and substandard living conditions in Jonestown. [79]
Facing increasing scrutiny, in the summer of 1978, Jones also hired noted JFK assassination conspiracy theorists Mark Lane and Donald Freed to help make the case of a "grand conspiracy" by intelligence agencies against the Peoples Temple.[80] Jones told Lane he wanted to "pull an Eldridge Cleaver", referring to a fugitive Black Panther that was able to return to the United States after repairing his reputation.[80]

[edit] Visit by Congressman Ryan, murders
Main article: Jonestown




Entrance to Jonestown (photo:Jonestown Institute)


In November 1978, U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan led a fact-finding mission to Jonestown to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.[81] Ryan's delegation included relatives of Temple members, Don Harris, an NBC network news reporter, an NBC cameraman and reporters for various newspapers.[82] The group arrived in Georgetown on November 15.[81] On November 17, Ryan's delegation traveled by airplane to Jonestown.[83] The delegation left hurriedly the afternoon of November 18 after Temple member Don Sly attacked Ryan with a knife.[84] The attack was thwarted, bringing the visit to an abrupt end.[84] Congressman Ryan and his people succeeded in taking with them fifteen People's Temple members who had expressed a wish to leave.[85] At that time, Jones made no attempt to prevent their departure.[86]

[edit] Port Kaituma Airstrip shootings
Main article: Jonestown
As members of Ryan's delegation boarded two planes at the airstrip, Jones' "Red Brigade" armed guards arrived in a tractor-pulled trailer and began shooting at the delegation.[87] The guards killed Congressman Ryan and four others near a twin engine Otter aircraft.[88] At the same time, one of the supposed defectors, Larry Layton, drew a weapon and began firing on members of the party that had already boarded a small Cessna.[89] An NBC cameraman was able to capture footage of the first few seconds of the shooting at the Otter.[88] The five killed at the airstrip were Congressman Ryan; Don Harris, a reporter from NBC; Bob Brown, a cameraman from NBC; San Francisco Examiner photographer Greg Robinson; and Temple member Patricia Parks.[88] Surviving the attack were future Congresswoman Jackie Speier, then a staff member for Ryan; Richard Dwyer, the Deputy Chief of Mission from the U.S. Embassy at Georgetown; Bob Flick, a producer for NBC News; Steve Sung, an NBC sound engineer; Tim Reiterman, a San Francisco Examiner reporter; Ron Javers, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter; Charles Krause, a Washington Post reporter; and several defecting Temple members.[88]
The murder of Congressman Ryan was the only murder of a Congressman in the line of duty in the history of the United States.[90]

[edit] Deaths in Jonestown
Main article: Jonestown
Later that same day, 909 inhabitants of Jonestown,[91] 276 of them children, died of apparent cyanide poisoning, mostly in and around a pavilion.[92] This resulted in the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the September 11, 2001 attacks.[93] No video was taken during the mass suicide, though the FBI did recover a 45 minute audio recording of the suicide in progress.[94]
On that tape, Jones tells Temple members that the Soviet Union, with whom the Temple had been negotiating a potential exodus for months, would not take them after the Temple had murdered Ryan and four others at a nearby airstrip.[94] The reason given by Jones to commit suicide was consistent with his previously stated conspiracy theories of intelligence organizations allegedly conspiring against the Temple, that men would "parachute in here on us," "shoot some of our innocent babies" and "they'll torture our children, they'll torture some of our people here, they'll torture our seniors."[94] Parroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to fascism, one temple member states "the ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies."[94]

Aftermath - Jim Jones pavilion chair and sign


Given that reasoning, Jones and several members argued that the group should commit "revolutionary suicide" by drinking cyanide-laced grape flavored Flavor Aid (often misidentified as Kool-Aid) along with a sedative.[94] One member, Christine Miller, dissents toward the beginning of the tape.[94] When members apparently cried, Jones counseled "Stop this hysterics. This is not the way for people who are Socialists or Communists to die. No way for us to die. We must die with some dignity."[94] Jones can be heard saying, "Don't be afraid to die," that death is "just stepping over into another plane" and that "[death is] a friend."[94] At the end of the tape, Jones concludes: "We didn't commit suicide, we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world."[94] According to escaping Temple members, children were given the drink first and families were told to lie down together.[95] Mass suicide had been previously discussed in simulated events called "White Nights" on a regular basis.[79][96] During at least one such prior White Night, members drank liquid that Jones falsely told them was poison.[79][96]
Jones was found dead in a deck chair with a gunshot wound to his head that Guyanese coroner Cyrill Mootoo stated was consistent with a self-inflicted gun wound.[97] However, Jones' son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him.[98] An autopsy of Jones' body also showed levels of the barbiturate Pentobarbital which may have been lethal to humans who had not developed physiological tolerance.[99] Jones' drug usage (including LSD and marijuana experimentation) was confirmed by his son, Stephan, and Jones' doctor in San Francisco.

[edit] Other issues
On December 13, 1973, Jones was arrested and charged with soliciting a man for sex in a movie theater bathroom known for homosexual activity, in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles.[100] The man was an undercover Los Angeles Police Department vice officer. Jones is on record as later telling his followers that he was "the only true heterosexual", but at least one account exists of his sexual abuse of a male member of his congregation in front of the followers, ostensibly to prove the man's own homosexual tendencies.[100]
While Jones banned sex among Temple members outside of marriage, he himself voraciously engaged in sexual relations with both male and female Temple members.[101][102] Jones, however, claimed that he detested engaging in homosexual activity and did so only for the male temple adherents' own good, purportedly to connect them symbolically with him (Jones).[101]
One of Jones' sources of inspiration was the controversial International Peace Mission movement leader Father Divine.[103] Jones had borrowed the term "revolutionary suicide"[104] from Black Panther leader and Peoples Temple supporter Huey Newton who had argued "the slow suicide of life in the ghetto" ought to be replaced by revolutionary struggle that would end only in victory (socialism and self determination) or revolutionary suicide (death).

Jim Jones' wife, Marceline, was found poisoned around the pavilion.[105] On the final morning of Ryan's visit, Marceline had taken reporters on a tour of Jonestown.[106]
Found near Marceline Jones' body was a signed and witnessed will leaving all bank accounts "in my name" to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and writing that Suzanne Jones Cartmell should receive no assets.[107] 
[edit] Stephan, Jim Jr. and Tim Jones
Stephan, Jim Jr., and Tim Jones did not take part in the mass suicide because they were playing with the Peoples Temple basketball team against the Guyanese national team in Georgetown.[24][104] At the time of events in Jonestown, Stephan and Tim were both nineteen and Jim Jones Jr. was eighteen.[108] Tim's biological family, the Tuppers, which consisted of his three biological sisters,[109][110][111] biological brother,[112] and biological mother,[113] all died at Jonestown. Three days before the tragedy, Stephan Jones refused, over the radio, to comply with an order by his father to return the team to Jonestown for Ryan's visit.[114]

During the events at Jonestown, Stephan, Tim, and Jim Jones Jr. drove to the American Embassy in Guyana in an attempt to receive help. The Guyanese soldiers guarding the embassy refused to let them in after hearing about the shootings at the Port Kaituma airstrip.[115] Later, the three returned to the Temple's headquarters in Georgetown to find the bodies of Sharon Amos and her three children.[115] Guyanese soldiers kept the Jones brothers under house arrest for five days, interrogating them about the deaths in Georgetown.[115] Stephan Jones was accused of being involved in the Georgetown deaths, and was placed in a Guyanese prison for three months.[115] Tim Jones and Johnny Cobb, another member of the Peoples Temple basketball team, were asked to go to Jonestown and help identify the bodies of people who had died.[115] After returning to the United States, Jim Jones Jr. was placed under police surveillance for several months while he lived with his older sister, Suzanne, who had previously turned against the Temple.[115]
When Jonestown was first being established, Stephan Jones had originally avoided two attempts by his father to relocate to the settlement. He eventually moved to Jonestown after a third and final attempt. He has since said that he gave into his father's wishes to move to Jonestown because of his mother.[116] Stephan Jones is now a businessman, who is married with three daughters. He appeared in the documentary Jonestown: Paradise Lost which aired on the History Channel and Discovery Channel. He stated he will not watch the documentary and has never grieved for his father.[117] Jim Jones Jr., who lost his wife and unborn child at Jonestown, returned to San Francisco. He remarried and has three sons from this marriage,[104] including Rob Jones, a high-school basketball star who went on to play for the University of San Diego.[118]

[edit] Lew, Agnes and Suzanne Jones




Agnes Jones


Lew and Agnes Jones both died at Jonestown. Agnes Jones was thirty-five years old at the time of her death.[119] Her husband[120] and four children[121][122][123][124] all died at Jonestown. Lew Jones, who was twenty-one years old at the time of his death, died alongside his wife Terry and son Chaeoke.[125][126][127] Stephanie Jones had died at age five in a car accident.[24]




Lew Jones, Terry and Chaeoke


Suzanne Jones married Mike Cartmell; both turned against the Temple and were not in Jonestown on November 18, 1978. After this decision to abandon the Temple, Jones referred to Suzanne openly as "my goddamned, no good for nothing daughter" and stated that she was not to be trusted.[128] In a signed note found at the time of her death, Marceline Jones directed that the Jones' funds were to be given to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and specified: "I especially request that none of these are allowed to get into the hands of my adopted daughter, Suzanne Jones Cartmell."[129] Cartmell had two children and died of colon cancer in November of 2006.[130][131]

Specific references to Tim Stoen, the father of John Stoen, including the logistics of possibly murdering him, are made on the Temple's final "death tape," as well as a discussion over whether the Temple should include John Stoen among those committing "revolutionary suicide."[94] At Jonestown, John Stoen was found poisoned in Jim Jones' cabin.[132]
Both Jim Jon (Kimo) and his mother, Carolyn Layton, died during the events at Jonestown.[133]

[edit] Notes

^ While Jim Jones claimed to be partially of Cherokee descent through his mother Lynetta's side, this story was apparently not true. (Lindsay, Robert, "How Rev. Jim Jones Gained His Power Over Followers", New York Times, November 26, 1978). Lynetta's cousin Barbara Shaffer said "there wasn't an ounce of Indian in our family." (Lindsay, Robert, "How Rev. Jim Jones Gained His Power Over Followers", New York Times, November 26, 1978). Shaffer said that Lynetta was Welsh. ("Jones--The Dark Private Side Emerges", Los Angeles Times, November 24, 1978). The birth records for Lynetta have since been lost. (Kilduff, Marshall and Ron Javers, "Jim Jones Always Led -- Or Wouldn't Play," San Francisco Chronicle, December 4, 1978).
