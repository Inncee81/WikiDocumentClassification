"A Mathematical Theory of Communication" is an influential 1948 article by mathematician Claude E. Shannon.

[edit] Description




Shannon's diagram of a general communication system.


The article was one of the founding works of the field of information theory. Shannon expanded the ideas of this article in a 1963 book with Warren Weaver titled The Mathematical Theory of Communication (ISBN 0-25-272548-4). Shannon's article laid out the basic elements of communication:

An information source that produces a message
A transmitter that operates on the message to create a signal which can be sent through a channel
A channel, which is the medium over which the signal, carrying the information that composes the message, is sent
A receiver, which transforms the signal back into the message intended for delivery
A destination, which can be a person or a machine, for whom or which the message is intended

It also developed the concepts of information entropy and redundancy, and introduced the term bit as a unit of information.
