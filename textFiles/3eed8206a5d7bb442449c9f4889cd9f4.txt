From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Nootropics, also referred to as smart drugs, memory enhancers, and cognitive enhancers, are drugs, nutraceuticals, and functional foods that are purported to improve human cognitive abilities.[1][2] The term covers a broad range of substances including drugs, nutrients and herbs with claimed cognitive enhancing effects.
The word nootropic was coined in 1964 by Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea, derived from the Greek words noos, or "mind," and tropein meaning "to bend/turn". Typically, nootropics are thought to work by altering the availability of the brain's supply of neurochemicals (neurotransmitters, enzymes, and hormones), by improving the brain's oxygen supply, or by stimulating nerve growth. However the efficacy of nootropic substances in most cases has not been conclusively determined. This is complicated by the difficulty of defining and quantifying cognition and intelligence.

[edit] Availability and prevalence
Currently there are several drugs on the market that improve memory, concentration, planning, and reduce impulsive behavior. Many more are in different stages of development.[3] The most commonly used class of drug are the stimulants.[4]
These drugs are used primarily to treat people with cognitive difficulties: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ADHD. However, more widespread use is being recommended by some researchers.[5] These drugs have a variety of human enhancement applications as well and are marketed heavily on the World Wide Web. Nevertheless, intense marketing may not correlate with efficacy; while scientific studies support some of the claimed benefits, it is worth noting that many of the claims attributed to most nootropics have not been formally tested.
In academia, modafinil has been used to increase productivity, although its long-term effects have not been assessed in healthy individuals.[3] Stimulants such as methylphenidate and atomoxetine are being used on college campuses, and by an increasingly younger group.[3] One survey found that 7% of students had used stimulants for a cognitive edge in the past year, and on some campuses the number is as high as 25%.[4]

[edit] Hazards
The main concern with pharmaceutical drugs is adverse effects, and these concerns apply to cognitive-enhancing drugs as well. Cognitive enhancers are often taken for the long-term for which little data is available.[3]
Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea originally coined the word nootropics for brain-enhancing drugs with very few side effects. Racetams are sometimes cited as an example of a nootropic with few effects and wide therapeutic window;[6] however, any substance ingested could produce harmful effects. An unapproved drug or dietary supplement does not have to have safety or efficacy approval before being sold.[7] (this mainly applies to the U.S.A., but may not apply in the E.U. or elsewhere) This nootropic list is not meant to be sufficient to determine the safety of a substance or mixture. Second, any efficacy described on this page should be demonstrated by references in the respective article, and if the claims are not referenced, at minimum in a clinical study, the claim or claims should not be taken seriously.
Some dangers of nootropics include, but are not limited to:

Downregulation of neurological activity upon stimulation, resulting in a permanent or temporary hypoactive system and/or addictive properties (applies to dopamine, choline, and many other neurotransmitter systems)
Serotonin syndrome from serotonergic agents
Excessive acetylcholine receptor activation - see acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
Heart failure, such as that from stimulants or any substance which alters heart rate
Organ failure such as liver failure and kidney failure

This list is not exhaustive. Any non-essential substances should only be taken after consideration from a doctor or otherwise legally competent physician.

[edit] Examples
The term "drug" here is used as a legal designation. Although some of the effects of these substances may be similar to others, only those substances that have shown cognitive effects are included.

[edit] Nootropics and racetams
The word nootropic was coined upon discovery of the effects of piracetam, developed in the 1960s.[8] Although piracetam is the most commonly taken nootropic,[8] there are many relatives in the family which have different potencies and side effects. Other commom racetams include pramiracetam, oxiracetam, and aniracetam. There is no generally accepted mechanism for racetams. They generally show no affinity for the most important receptors, although modulation of most important central neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine and glutamate have been reported.[9] Although aniracetam and nebracetam show affinity for muscarinic receptors, only nefiracetam shows it at the nanomolar range. Racetams have been called "pharmacologically safe" drugs.[6]
Other substances sometimes classified as nootropics include hydergine, vinpocetine, bifemelane, huperzine A (cholinergic activator below), and dimethylaminoethanol.[6]

[edit] Stimulants
Stimulants are often seen as smart drugs. These typically improve concentration and cognitive performance, but only while the drug is still in the blood. Some scientists recommend widespread use of stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamines by the general population to increase brain power.[4]

Amphetamines (and related drugs)

Amphetamine (Adderall) - Dopaminergic
Cocaine - Dopaminergic
Methamphetamine - Dopaminergic, Serotonergic, Adrenergic
Methylphenidate (Ritalin) - Dopaminergic
Pemoline - Dopaminergic


Eugeroics ("wakefulness enhancers") - unproven primary mechanisms but proven efficacy

Adrafinil
Armodafinil
Modafinil


Xanthines

Caffeine - reduces fatigue perception
Theophylline




[edit] Dopaminergics
Dopaminergics are substances that affect the neurotransmitter dopamine or the components of the nervous system that use dopamine. Attributable effects of dopamine are enhancement of attention, alertness, and antioxidant activity. Dopamine is the primary activity of stimulants like ritalin or amphetamine. Dopaminergic nootropics include dopamine synthesis precursors, dopamine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other compounds:

Metabolic precursors - raise levels

L-Phenylalanine - purported cognitive improvement
L-Tyrosine - purported cognitive improvement
L-DOPA - direct metabolic precursor (can be found in mucuna pruriens seeds)


Reuptake inhibitors - stabilize/improve levels

Amineptine - mild stimulant


MAO-B inhibitors - prevent breakdown

Selegiline - mild stimulant


Others

cocaine and the relatives - multiple mechanisms that amplify dopamine release
amphetamine and relatives
Yohimbe - purported dopaminergic activity




[edit] Memory Enhancement
Memory can come from many different processes, but is dependent on the ability to store and recall information.

[edit] Cholinergics
Cholinergics are substances that affect the neurotransmitter acetylcholine or the components of the nervous system that use acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a facilitator of memory formation. Increasing the availability of this neurotransmitter in the brain may improve these functions. Cholinergic nootropics include acetylcholine precursors and cofactors, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors:

Acetylcarnitine - Amino acid. functions in ActCh production (donating the acetyl portion to the acetylcholine molecule).
Choline and its precursors - Precursor (chemistry) to acetylcholine
Vitamin B5 - cofactor in the conversion of choline into acetylcholine
Galantamine - acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
Huperzine A - acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
Donepezil - Drug. acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
Rosemary - acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
Sage - acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
Coluracetam - choline uptake enhancer
Meclofenoxate - Drug. Probable precursor approved for Dementia and Alzheimers
Ispronicline - recently developed nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist
Nicotine - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist
Arecoline - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist


[edit] GABAergics
The GABAA α5 receptor site has recently displayed memory improvements when agonized.

α5IA - Highly selective experimental drug
Suritozole - experimental - displays selectiveness


[edit] Glutamate activators
The AMPA transmitter and the AMPA receptors are currently being researched with significant memory improvements and possible alertness enhancement when agonized. The drug class for AMPA system modulation is called Ampakines. Although there are many in-research ones, the main ones mentioned will be the ones possibly coming to market or are significantly notable.
Some racetams have shown this activity

CX-717 - Going through FDA approval for memory-impairing illnesses
IDRA-21 - believed to improve memory by significantly enhancing long term potentiation but only used in animals - incredibly potent
LY-503,430 - Being developed for Parkinsons but showing increase in BDNF, specifically in areas of memory and higher cognitive skills


[edit] cAMP
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate is a secondary messenger which if increased has shown memory improvements. One common method is by decreasing the activity of phosphodiesterase-4, an enzyme that breaks down cAMP. Typical effects include wakefulness and memory enhancement.

Propentofylline - nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor with some neuroenhancement
Rolipram - Drug. shows alertness enhancement, long term memory improvement and neuroprotection
Mesembrine - PDE4-inhibitor with possible serotonergic activity


[edit] Serotonergics
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter with various effects on mood and possible effects on neurogenesis. Serotonergics are substances that affect the neurotransmitter serotonin or the components of the nervous system that use serotonin. Serotonergic nootropics include serotonin precursors and cofactors, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors:

5-HTP - precursor
Tryptophan - Essential amino acid
SSRIs - Class of antidepressants that increase active serotonin levels by inhibiting its reuptake. Have also been shown to promote Neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
Tianeptine - paradoxical antidepressant, improves mood and reduces anxiety
Methamphetamine - some serotonin activity


[edit] Anti-depression, adaptogenic (antistress), and mood stabilization
Stress, depression, and depressed mood negatively affect cognitive performance. It is reasoned that counteracting and preventing depression and stress may be an effective nootropic strategy. The term adaptogen applies to most herbal anti-stress claims.
The substances below may not have been mentioned earlier on the page:

Beta blockers - anxiolytic
Kava kava - mild stimulant used in relaxation
Lemon Balm - Displays adaptogen properties
Passion Flower - possible MAOI and neurotransmitter reuptake activity
Rhodiola Rosea - possible MAOI activity
St John's Wort - herbal SSRI that has been approved (in Europe) to treat mild depression
Ginseng (including Siberian ginseng) - adaptogenic effects shown
Sutherlandia frutescens - possible anti-inflammatory reducing pain from those illnesses
Tea - contains many different adaptogens
Theanine - GABAergic activity producing relaxation, also increases brain serotonin and dopamine levels
Grape seed extract - has shown some efficacy in reducing bodily stress
Adafenoxate - possible anti-anxiety effect
Butea frondosa - possible anti-anxiety effect[10]
Gotu Kola - adaptogen and anxiolytic


[edit] Blood flow and Metabolic function
Brain function is dependent on many basic processes such as the usage of ATP, removal of waste, and intake of new materials. Improving blood flow or altering these processes can benefit brain function. Vasodilators mentioned are only this which have shown, at minimum, probable mental enhancement.

Coenzyme q-10 - increases oxygen usage by mitochondria
Creatine - protects ATP during transport
Lipoic acid - improves oxygen usage and antioxidant recycling, possibly improving memory
Pyritinol - Drug. Similar to B vitamin Pyridoxine
Vinpocetine - increases blood circulation (vasodilator) and metabolism in the brain
Picamilon - GABA activity and blood flow improver
Ginkgo biloba - vasodilator


[edit] Nerve growth stimulation and brain cell protection
Nerves are necessary to the foundation of brain communication and their degeneracy, underperformance, or lacking can have disastrous results on brain functions. Antioxidants are frequently used to prevent oxidative stress, but do not improve brain function if that is their only activity.

Idebenone - antioxidant
Inositol - implicated in memory function, deficit linked to some psychiatric illnesses
dopamine enhancers - dopamine is an antioxidant and can enhance dendrite extension
Anticonvulsants inhibit seizure related brain malfunction if a person has seizures
Phosphatidylserine - possible membrane stabilizer


[edit] Recreational drugs
Many recreational substances which are currently illegal or heavily controlled have effects on the brain or long-term functions that are typically considered secondary to their effects on perception. These drugs are assumed to have significant dependency or abuse potential, either physically, psychologically, or both. Note that this list is not intended to be exhaustive. This list include substances which are illegal, or not completely illegal, but are controlled or exempt under a Drug schedule.
See also: Controlled substances act and Misuse of Drugs Act 1971

Tetrahydrocannabinol - Anxiolytic and analgesic found in cannabis. Neuroprotectant, possible alzheimers prevention and possible neurogenesis inducer
Amphetamine-type stimulants are described above
LSD - Psychedelic drug. At sub-recreational doses serotonin activity could alter neurogenesis and improve mood.
4-methylaminorex - similar to Modafinil but significantly more abuse potential
Most Entheogens, including hallucinogens - drugs or substances which have shown value in psychotherapy, like mescaline, MDMA, and others
MDPV - designer drug, 4x as potent as methylphenidate, greater abuse potential
Tobacco - Contains nicotine and also has significant MAOI activity


[edit] Dietary nootropics
Diet can have the greatest effect on cognition and the brain, as there are many necessary things which must be consumed. However, other substances have been linked to certain benefits, and may be predominant in certain foods.
Some regular food items contain substances with alleged nootropic benefits:

Hemp - seeds as source of omega-3 fatty acids (see essential fatty acid)
Fish - sources of omega-3 fatty acids (see essential fatty acid)
Berries - may contain high levels of antioxidants


[edit] Direct Hormones
These are hormones that have activity not necessarily attributable to another specific chemical interaction, but have shown effectiveness. Only specific nootropic effects are stated.

Vasopressin - memory hormone that improves both memory encoding and recall
Pregnenolone - increases neurogenesis
Orexin - Significant wakefulness promoter


[edit] Secondary enhancers
These are substances which by themselves may not improve brain function, but may have benefits for those lacking them (in the case of hormones) or may alter the balance of neurotransmitters.

DHEA - Precursor to Estrogen and Testosterone


[edit] Unknown enhancement
Other agents purported to have nootropic claims but do not have (as of yet) attributable mechanisms or have clinically insignificant effects (but may upon refinement of administration) to warrant inclusion into other sections are mentioned here.
Nootropics with proven or purported benefits:

Bacopa monniera - elevates curiosity, enhances memory and concentration.[11]
Brahmi rasayana - improved learning and memory in mice.[12]
Ergoloid mesylates - Drug. Similar to LSD. Used against Dementia and Alzheimers
Fipexide - drug for Dementia
Gerovital H3 - famous anti-aging mixture, most effects disproven, but some mind enhancement shown
Sulbutiamine - Drug. Some shown memory improvement
Royal Jelly - Increases brain cell growth and diversity, only proven in-vitro, improbable in-vivo
Curcumin - Significant in-vitro activity, but in-vivo activity is limited by low bioavailability


[edit] Other nootropics
These substances have been linked to better cognitive function, but may not be the cause. See correlation does not imply causation

Moderate use of alcohol - Moderate drinkers tend to have better cognitive function than both abstainers and heavy drinkers.[13][14][15][16][17]
