Almost every April Fools' Day (1 April) since 1989, the Internet Engineering Task Force has published one or more humorous RFC documents, following in the path blazed by the June 1973 RFC 527 entitled ARPAWOCKY, which parodied Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem Jabberwocky. The following list also includes humorous RFCs published on other dates.

[edit] List of April 1st RFCs

RFC 748—TELNET RANDOMLY-LOSE option. M.R. Crispin. 1 April 1978. A parody of the TCP/IP documentation style. Due to some people taking it seriously, for a long time it was specially marked in the RFC index with "note date of issue".

[edit] Non-RFC IETF humor

An announcement on the IETF list [2] about the appointment of the Sesame Street character Bert[3] as member of the IAB appears to have been the April Fools' Day 2006 stunt.


[edit] Submission of April Fools' Day RFCs
The IETF accepts submission of properly formatted April Fools' Day RFCs from the general public, and considers them for publication in the same year if received at least two weeks prior to April, 1st.[1][2]
