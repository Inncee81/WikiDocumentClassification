Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a method of displaying information (generally text) using a limited space in which each piece of information is displayed briefly in sequential order.
It is currently being investigated as a possibility for displaying documents on devices with small displays such as mobile phones or PDAs.[1]
Research done by the Wichita State University suggests that at 250 words per minute (WPM) comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using Palm Reader. Display at 650 WPM reduced comprehension by 20%.[2]
RSVP is used as a research tool in perceptual and cognitive psychology. Subjects in RSVP frequently make errors corresponding to attentional blink, temporal masking and repetition blindness.
