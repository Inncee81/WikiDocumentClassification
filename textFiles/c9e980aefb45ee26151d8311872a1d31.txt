This article is about the movement in the British Conservative Party.  For the form of democracy, see direct democracy.
Direct Democracy is a movement within the British Conservative Party dedicated to localism and constitutional reform as a means of reviving public confidence in the political system. The group's founding text - Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party - was published in 2005 and was followed by a series of localist papers on constitutional reform, education, law and order, foreign policy, welfare reform and the environment. Direct Democracy's agenda features heavily in the Daily Telegraph and inspired the paper's ongoing Think Local campaign. In a testament to Direct Democracy's campaigning effectiveness and influence within the Conservative Party, many of their proposals have now become official Party policy - e.g. directly-elected sheriffs, the right of citizens' initiative, and supply-side school reform.
