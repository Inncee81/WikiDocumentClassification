AAlib is a software library which allows applications to automatically convert still and moving images into ASCII art.
It has been used in a wide variety of programs, including a conversion of Quake II which allows the 3D game to be played on dumb terminals,[1] and to let media players output in text mode (Xine, MPlayer, VLC).[2]
AAlib is freely distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.[3]
