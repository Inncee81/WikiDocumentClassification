From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The PlayStation 3 system software is the updatable software and operating system of the PlayStation 3. The process of updating is almost identical to that of the PSP. Each update includes all previous update data.
The software may be updated by downloading the update directly on the PlayStation 3, downloading it from the user's local Official PlayStation website to a PC and using a USB storage device to transfer it to the PlayStation 3, or installing the update from game discs containing update data. This software is sometimes incorrectly referred to as firmware, but the use of such wording can be misleading as some of the updates are in excess of 100MB and include high-level applications and as such are more substantial than the traditional notion of "firmware".
The 3D computer graphics API software used in the Playstation 3 is LibGCM and PSGL, based on OpenGL ES.[1] For comparison, Microsoft uses the DirectX 3D computer graphics API in their Xbox 360 console.
The PlayStation 3 uses the XrossMediaBar (XMB) as its graphical user interface.
The current version of the software, 2.70, was made available on April 1, 2009. [2]

[edit] Software update information
Due to the regular releases of updates to the system's software, the majority of the time newly purchased consoles will not have the latest version of the system software installed. However, any games that require a specific version of the system software will include the update required on the game disc. For example, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction featured v1.94. This update was only available via this game and the only feature it added to prior updates was DualShock 3 controller support, as this was the first game to support the controller without needing an update to the game itself.
