A place name is tautological if two parts of it are synonymous. This often occurs when a name from one language is imported into another and a standard descriptor is added on from the second language. Thus, for example, New Zealand's Mount Maunganui, where maunga is Māori for mountain. The following list is of place names often used tautologically, plus the languages from which the non-English name elements have originally come.
Since there are sometimes many similar names in one area in many cases where two languages are in common use, this should be noted with one exemplar case.
This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
