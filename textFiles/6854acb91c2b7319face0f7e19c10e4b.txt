[edit] Features
SUPER can manipulate and produce many multimedia file formats supported by its back-end programs.
Back-end program features supported by SUPER include saving various streaming protocols (mms, rtsp, and http), conversion of Flash Video to other formats, and user-controlled conversion of video between different container formats. Users can chose between various lossless direct audio/video transfers between container formats or lossy video/audio encoding, with encoding possessing the added ability to change video and audio specifications such as bitrate, framerate, audio channels, resolution, sampling rate, and aspect ratio.
SUPER is also able to utilize its back-end's built-in media players, allowing playback of supported video and audio formats.
SUPER requires to be installed and run under full administrative credentials.[2] It also attempts to connect to the Internet every time it is run in order to check for auto-updates or prepare to stream the supported Internet Media Streams protocols (mms://, rtsp://, and http:// ). Denying the internet access to SUPER will not affect at all its functionality.[3]
