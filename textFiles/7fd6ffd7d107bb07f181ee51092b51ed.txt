From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

System testing of software or hardware is testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements. System testing falls within the scope of black box testing, and as such, should require no knowledge of the inner design of the code or logic. [1]
As a rule, system testing takes, as its input, all of the "integrated" software components that have successfully passed integration testing and also the software system itself integrated with any applicable hardware system(s). The purpose of integration testing is to detect any inconsistencies between the software units that are integrated together (called assemblages) or between any of the assemblages and the hardware. System testing is a more limiting type of testing; it seeks to detect defects both within the "inter-assemblages" and also within the system as a whole.

[edit] Testing the whole system
System testing is performed on the entire system in the context of a Functional Requirement Specification(s) (FRS) and/or a System Requirement Specification (SRS). System testing is an investigatory testing phase, where the focus is to have almost a destructive attitude[citation needed] and tests not only the design, but also the behaviour and even the believed expectations of the customer. It is also intended to test up to and beyond the bounds defined in the software/hardware requirements specification(s). System testing includes the Load testing and Stress testing. Once the Load testing and Stress testing is completed successfully, the next level of Alpha Testing or beta Testing will go ahead.

[edit] Types of system testing
The following examples are different types of testing that should be considered during System testing:

GUI software testing
Usability testing
Performance testing
Compatibility testing
Error handling testing
Load testing
Volume testing
Stress testing
User help testing
Security testing
Scalability testing
Capacity testing
Sanity testing
Smoke testing
Exploratory testing
Ad hoc testing
Regression testing
Reliability testing
Recovery testing
Installation testing
Idempotency testing
Maintenance testing
Accessibility testing, including compliance with:

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)



Although different testing organizations may prescribe different tests as part of System testing, this list serves as a general framework or foundation to begin with.
