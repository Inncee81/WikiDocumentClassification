Ghoti is a constructed example used to illustrate irregularities in English spelling. It is a respelling of the word fish, and like fish is pronounced /ˈfɪʃ/. It has,

gh, pronounced [f] as in tough [tʌf];
o, pronounced [ɪ] as in women [ˈwɪmɪn]; and
ti, pronounced [ʃ] as in nation [ˈneɪʃən].

The first known published reference is in 1874, citing an 1855 letter that credits ghoti to one William Ollier (born 1824).[1] Ghoti is often cited to support English spelling reform, and is often attributed to George Bernard Shaw,[2] a supporter of this cause. However, a biography of Shaw attributes it instead to an anonymous spelling reformer.[3]

[edit] Purpose of irregularities
See also: English spelling reform
It has also been noted[4] that many of the irregularities that do exist in English spelling serve to preserve visual graphemic reminders of the word's history and etymology. For example, the word "electrician," in which the ci is pronounced [ʃ] due to palatalization, retains a graphemic linkage to its root "electricity," which would be lost if the different forms of the word were spelled "elektrishun," "elektrisity," and "elektrik." However, many other words in English have spellings that do obscure the word roots with more phonemically-accurate spellings, such as clear/clarify and deceit/deception.
The [ʃ] sound can be spelled eleven ways in English:[5] shirt, sugar, chute, action, issue, ocean, conscious, mansion, schwa, anxious, and special. It is spelled 'ti' only when the 'ti' comes before a vowel, as in nation and initial.
Likewise, "gh" can represent [f] at the end or middle of the word, as in "tough" or "laughter", but not at the beginning of the word. The consonant cluster "gh" represents a "g" sound at the beginning of words such as "ghost", and may be silent in the middle of words such as "right".

[edit] Cultural references
