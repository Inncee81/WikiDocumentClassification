It has been suggested that Timeline of Star Wars Books be merged into this article or section. (Discuss)







This Star Wars-related article describes an aspect of Star Wars in a primarily in-universe style. Please help rewrite it to explain the fiction more clearly and provide non-fictional perspective.







This article needs references that appear in reliable third-party publications. Primary sources or sources affiliated with the subject are generally not sufficient for a Wikipedia article. Please add more appropriate citations from reliable sources. (June 2007)







This article includes a list of references or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations where appropriate. (June 2007)


Fans of the Star Wars fictional universe keep track of the "dates" of key events within the storyline according to narrated time and chronology rather than real-world narrative time and publishing chronology. For this purpose, a dating system (or calendar) reckoned at the Battle of Yavin featured in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is being used. In this dating system, BBY stands for Before the Battle of Yavin, and ABY stands for After the Battle of Yavin, so 50 BBY comes before 5 ABY, as with BC and AD. Occasionally, the defeat of the Empire at the Battle of Endor (four years after Yavin) has been used as an alternate starting year, but has generally been phased out in favor of the current standard system. When Bantam Spectra held the license for Star Wars novels, they described their books as after Endor, but Del Rey, the current license-holder, exclusively uses ABY.
A galactic year, based on the length of a year on Coruscant, is 368 standard days, one standard day being a time period of equal length as a day on Coruscant (43 hours of 23 minutes each). It is composed of 10 months.

[edit] Time measurement in the Star Wars galaxy
In the official continuity’s Star Wars universe (based on Coruscant’s rotation):

1 Coruscant year = 10 months (350 days) + 3 festival weeks (15 days) + 3 holidays (3 days) = 368 days
1 Coruscant month = 7 weeks = 35 days
1 Coruscant week = 5 days
1 Coruscant day = 18 hours
1 Coruscant hour = 69 minutes


[edit] The Galactic year

From the above information, we can extrapolate that the year, whether Tapani-named or not, in the Star Wars galaxy as follows:

2 months
2 months
1 holiday
1 month
1 festival week
2 months
1 holiday

1 festival week
