[edit] Orthography and diction
Japanese particles are written in hiragana in modern Japanese, even though some of them have kanji forms. They follow the same rules of phonetical transcription as all Japanese words, with the exception of the phonetical wa, e and o, written は (ha), へ (he) and を (wo) respectively ; note that some speakers pronounce the particle wo. These exceptions are a relic of historical kana usage.

[edit] tte
Written as って in hiragana, this is another form of to. It is a shortened version of itte (言って), the present progressive form of the verb iu (言う), "to say"; it functions as a type of verbal quotation mark. It is sometimes used for a direct quote, sometimes for an indirect quote, and sometimes simply to emphasize a word or concept.
tte is casual, and (because it can be a direct quote) the politeness level of the quoted material does not necessarily reflect on the speaker. If you wish to be assuredly formal, use to iimasu instead of tte.

Sugu kimasu tte could be, "He said he'll come soon" (more politely) or, "He said, 'I'll come soon.'" (less so).

Emphasizing a word or concept thoughtfully:

Arabugo tte, muzukashikunai?, "Arabic, huh, isn't that difficult?"


[edit] tteba


ってば
Functions as:'strong emphasis marker, especially when the speaker has grown impatient.

Follows
Example sentence
Translation


Any phrase: quotation
kōhī datteba !
コーヒーだってば！

[edit] wa
Wa is a topic marker. It is written with the hiragana は ha, rather than the hiragana わ, wa. Not to be confused with the particle が.
Wa is also often used by females at the end of the sentence to establish an emotional connection (in this case, it is written with the hiragana わ, wa). This also conveys a certain deference to the speaker's wishes and emotions.

[edit] ya
Ya is used to make incomplete lists of things.

Watashi no suki na tabemono wa okashi ya pan ya mikan nado desu, "I like snacks, bread and tangerines."

To make an exhaustive list, the particle to is used instead.

[edit] yara
Written やら, this particle denotes either uncertainty or listing.

[edit] yo
よ Yo comes at the end of the sentence, and is used to make assertions. Compare zo and ze below.

Kaeru yo! means "I'm going home!"

Yo is also sometimes used after nouns, and functions as a vocative marker. This is especially used in older speech, poetry, and songs.

Saraba, tomo yo, "Farewell, oh friend!"


[edit] yori
Yori can mean "from", and is also used to make comparisons.

Kono densha-wa, Kashiwa-yori saki, kaku eki-ni tomarimasu "This train will stop at every station after Kashiwa".
Dare-yori-mo kanemochi-ni naritai "I want to become richer than anyone (else)".

Yori is usually written より in hiragana.

[edit] ze
ぜ, ze indicates assertion. Used mostly by men, it is never considered polite. Compare yo and zo.

[edit] zo
ぞ, zo indicates assertion. Used mainly by men, it is considered somewhat less forceful and more positive than ze. Compare yo and ze above.

[edit] zutsu
Zutsu means "each" and usually follows counted nouns:

Chokorēto-o ni-ko-zutsu tabemashita, which means "I ate two pieces of each (kind of) chocolate.

Zutsu is written with hiragana as ずつ.

[edit] Contrast

[edit] wa and ga
Main article: Japanese grammar#Topic, theme, and subject: は (wa) and が (ga)

[edit] ni and de
Ni and de can both be used to show location, corresponding to the prepositions "in" or "at" in English. Their uses are mutually exclusive.
Ni, when used to show location, is used only with stative verbs such as iru, "to be, exist;" aru, "to be, exist, have;" and sumu, "to live, inhabit."

Nihon-ni sumu. "I live in Japan."
Gakkō-ni iru. "I am in school."

De is used with action verbs to convey the place of action, as opposed to location of being.

Gakkō-de neru. "I sleep in school."
*Gakkō-ni neru. *"I sleep to school," is not a meaningful construction


[edit] ni and e
Ni and e can both indicate direction of motion, meaning "to" or "at" in English. In this sense, e is perhaps closer to English "towards" in terms of use (see example below). As long as ni is used directionally, it is possible to substitute e in its place. Ni used in other senses cannot be replaced by e:

Gakkō ni iku. "I'm going to school," where gakkō, "school," is the destination of iku, "go."
Gakkō e iku. "I'm going to school," where gakkō, "school," is the destination of iku, "go."


Gakkō ni iru. "I'm at school," where gakkō, "school," is the location of iru, "be;" not a destination.
*Gakkō e iru. *"I'm to school," is not a possible construction since "be" is not a verb of motion.


Tomodachi ni au "I'll meet my friends," where tomodachi, "friends," is the indirect object of au, "meet;" not a destination.
*Tomodachi e au *"I'll meet to my friends," which is impossible because "meet" is not a verb of motion.


Hon o kai ni itta "I went to buy a book," where kai ni, "to buy," shows purpose or intent, and is a verbal adverb; not destination.
*Hon o kai e itta *"I went towards buying a book," is not possible because kai, "buying," cannot be a destination.

Indicating direction, using e instead of ni is preferred when ni is used non-directionally in proximity:

Tomodachi ni ai ni Kyōto e itta. "I went to Kyoto to meet my friends."


[edit] ga and o
In some cases, ga and o are interchangeable. For example, with the tai form, meaning "want to", it is possible to say either of the following:

Gohan-ga tabetai. "I want to eat rice."
Gohan-o tabetai. "I want to eat rice."

Similarly, suki, a na adjective meaning "liked", can take either ga or o:

Kimi-ga suki da "I like you"
Kimi-o suki de yokatta "I'm glad I like you" (words from a popular song)


[edit] ni and to
Ni and to are sometimes interchangeable in forms like ni naru and to naru. The to naru form suggests a natural change, whereas ni naru suggests some indirect agent.

[edit] ya and to
Ya is used for incomplete lists, whereas to is used for complete ones.

[edit] Differences from English prepositions
Many Japanese particles fill the role of prepositions in English, but they are unlike prepositions in many ways. Japanese does not have equivalents of prepositions like "on", and often uses particles along with verbs and nouns to modify another word where English might use prepositions. For example, ue is a noun meaning "top/up"; and ni tsuite is a fixed verbal expression meaning "concerning", and when used as postpositions:

Tēburu-no　　-ue-ni　　　aru.
Table-OF　　top/up-AT　exists.
"It's on the table."


Ano　　hito-wa, 　　　gitā-ni 　　tsuite　　nandemo　wakaru.
That　person-TOPIC　guitar-TO　concerning　anything　　knows.
"That person knows everything about guitars."
