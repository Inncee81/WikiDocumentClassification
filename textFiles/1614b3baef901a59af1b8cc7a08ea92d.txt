From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Oobleck is a fictional green precipitation invented by children's author Dr. Seuss in the book Bartholomew and the Oobleck. The word has since been used to describe a mixture of corn starch and water used to demonstrate the dilatant property of non-Newtonian fluids. Oobleck is also known in the United Kingdom as "goop" or "gloop" in many primary and nursery schools.
In Bartholomew and the Oobleck, a king bored with ordinary rain, sunshine, fog, and snow orders wizards to create something new. They cause green precipitation called Oobleck to fall from the sky. The Oobleck proves so sticky that it gums up the whole kingdom until the day is saved by Bartholomew Cubbins, the title character from Dr. Seuss' 1938 book The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins.

[edit] Glurch
The similar Glurch is the nickname given to a polymer substance created in many science courses. It consists of starch, glue and food coloring. It is used to show the process of polymerization.

[edit] Theater Oobleck
Theater Oobleck is a liberal experimental independent theater company based in Chicago. Many members have their collaborative roots with the former Streetlight Theater of Ann Arbor, MI.
