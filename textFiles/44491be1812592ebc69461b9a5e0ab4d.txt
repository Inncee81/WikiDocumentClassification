The layout (reduced) and writing style of the Time Cube website.


Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray in 1997, where he sets out his proposed theory of everything, a description of the nature of the universe. The website uses a distinctive combination of colorful large-font text, occasional black-and-white drawings, obscure statements, and unconventional grammar.
The Time Cube concept itself is the proposition that time is cubic, a set of ideas which are generally viewed as cryptic and ill-defined. It is a frequent target of Internet humor. Ray has challenged various authorities to debate the subject, but these challenges have generally been ignored or rejected.
Though he is often dismissed as a crank,[1] Ray is outspoken in defending Time Cube and refers to conspiracy theories in explaining why his ideas are not accepted. Ray often uses the word "evil" on his website to describe those who oppose or fail to understand his ideas. He also prophesies the "burning in hell" of not just those who oppose his ideas, but of anyone who is ignorant of them.
Ray proclaimed himself a "Doctor of Cubicism" in December 2002. He sometimes uses the title "Dr. Gene Ray - Cubic and Wisest Human".

[edit] The Time Cube concept
The following quotation captures both the style of Ray's writing and a major recurring theme of the Time Cube:


“
When the Sun shines upon Earth, 2 - major Time points are created on opposite sides of Earth - known as Midday and Midnight. Where the 2 major Time forces join, synergy creates 2 new minor Time points we recognize as Sunup and Sundown.
The 4-equidistant Time points can be considered as Time Square imprinted upon the circle of Earth. In a single rotation of the Earth sphere, each Time corner point rotates through the other 3-corner Time points, thus creating 16 corners, 96 hours and 4-simultaneous 24 hour Days within a single rotation of Earth - equated to a Higher Order of Life Time Cube.

”


It appears that the main claim of Ray's ideas relates to the simultaneous existence of four days within a single rotation of Earth (noon to noon, midnight to midnight, sunrise to sunrise, and sunset to sunset) and the subsequent inference that the planet itself is not a physical "entity", as its hemispheres actually independently rotate in opposite directions and cancel out, as antipodes.
Ray also claims that well-established mathematical concepts are incorrect, for example operations on negative numbers:


“
-1 x -1= +1 is WRONG, it is academic stupidity and is evil. The educated stupid should acknowledge the natural antipodes of +1 x +1 = +1 and -1 x -1 = -1 exist as plus and minus values of opposite creation - depicted by opposite sexes and opposite hemispheres.
”


Other points made on Ray's website include repeated assertions that all academic establishments are "evil" for not teaching Time Cube and that readers who do not agree or are ignorant of his ideas "deserve death".

[edit] Public debate of the concept
Ray has claimed to offer $10,000 to any academic institution or professor who disproves Time Cube. Later, the offer was reduced to $1,000. Many academics have viewed the website as incoherent and not possible to evaluate scientifically.
Bei Dawei of Hsuan Chuang University in Taiwan has written a sophisticated exploration of Time Cube. In "Proving Human Stupidity: Time Cube, Gnosis, and the Challenge of Radical Cosmology", he draws analogies between Ray's achievements and those of the Greek astronomer Hipparchus.[2]
Ray spoke at MIT in January 2002,[3] as part of MIT's annual Independent Activities Period, a one-month period where students can take and offer classes of as widely varied topics as Einstein's relativity, astrology, or the Klingon language from Star Trek. He also spoke at Georgia Tech in April 2005.
