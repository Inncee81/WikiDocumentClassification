From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Electroreception, sometimes called electroception, is the biological ability to perceive electrical impulses. It is particularly common among aquatic creatures since water is a much more efficient conductor than air. It is used for electrolocation (detecting objects) and for electrocommunication. There are no known cases of mimicry involving electroreception, though it is theoretically possible. Although this can sometimes be used as a weapon as the animal using this ability emits an electrical field which can electrocute any animal within range of it[1]
