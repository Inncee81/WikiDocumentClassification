The PlayStation 3 (officially marketed PLAYSTATION 3,[5] commonly abbreviated PS3) is the third home video game console produced by Sony Computer Entertainment, and the successor to the PlayStation 2 as part of the PlayStation series. The PlayStation 3 competes with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.
A major feature that distinguishes the PlayStation 3 from its predecessors is its unified online gaming service, the PlayStation Network,[6] which contrasts with Sony's former policy of relying on game developers for online play.[7] Other major features of the console include its robust multimedia capabilities,[8] connectivity with the PlayStation Portable,[9] and its use of a high-definition optical disc format, Blu-ray Disc, as its primary storage medium.[10] The PS3 was also the first Blu-ray 2.0-compliant Blu-ray player on the market.[11]
The PlayStation 3 was first released on November 11, 2006 in Japan,[12] November 17, 2006 in North America,[13] and March 23, 2007 in Europe and Oceania.[14][15] Two SKUs were available at launch: a basic model with a 20 GB hard drive (HDD), and a premium model with a 60 GB hard drive and several additional features[16] (the 20 GB model was not released in Europe or Oceania).[17] Since then, several revisions have been made to the console's available models.[18]

History




Silver PlayStation 3 prototype (E3 2005 specs). Note the two additional USB ports, three gigabit ethernet ports and two HDMI ports.


See also: History of video game consoles (seventh generation)
Sony officially unveiled the PlayStation 3 to the public on May 16, 2005, during the E3 2005 conference.[19] A functional version of the system was not present there,[20] nor at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005,[21] although demonstrations (such as Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots[20]) were held at both events on devkits and comparable PC hardware.[20][21] Video footage based on the predicted PlayStation 3 specifications was also shown (notably a Final Fantasy VII tech demo).[22]
The initial prototype shown in May 2005 featured two HDMI ports, three Ethernet ports and six USB ports;[23] however, when the system was shown again a year later at E3 2006, these were reduced to one HDMI port, one ethernet port and four USB ports, presumably to cut costs.[16][24] Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console: a 20 GB model and a 60 GB model, priced at $499 (€499) and $599 (€599), respectively.[16] The 60 GB model would be the only configuration to feature an HDMI port, Wi-Fi internet, flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver.[16] Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release: November 11 for Japan, and November 17 for North America and Europe.[25]
On September 6, 2006, Sony announced that the PAL region (Europe and Oceania) PlayStation 3 launch would be delayed until March 2007, due to a shortage of materials used in the Blu-ray Disc drive.[26]
At the Tokyo Game Show on September 22, 2006, Sony announced that it would include an HDMI port on the 20 GB system, but a chrome trim, flash card readers, silver logo, and Wi-Fi would not be included.[27] Also, the launch price of the Japanese 20 GB model was reduced by over 20%,[28] and the 60 GB model was announced for an open pricing scheme in Japan.[28] During the event, Sony showed 27 playable PS3 games running on final hardware.[29]

Launch
Main article: PlayStation 3 launch
The PlayStation 3 was first released in Japan on November 11, 2006 at 07:00.[12] According to Media Create, 81,639 PS3 systems were sold within 24 hours of its introduction in Japan.[30]
Soon after its release in Japan, the PS3 was released in North America on November 17, 2006.[13] Reports of violence surrounding the release of the PS3 include a customer shot,[31] campers robbed at gunpoint,[32] customers shot in a drive-by shooting with BB guns,[33] and 60 campers fighting over 10 systems.[34]
On January 24, 2007, Sony announced that the PlayStation 3 would go on sale on March 23, 2007 in Europe, Australia, the Middle East, Africa and New Zealand.[14][15] The system sold about 600,000 units in its first two days.[35] On March 7, 2007, the 60 GB PlayStation 3 launched in Singapore with a price of S$799.[36] The console was launched in South Korea on June 16, 2007 in a single version equipped with an 80 GB hard drive and IPTV.[37]

Retail configurations

^ b Ceramic white model available in Asia and Japan only.
^ c Satin silver model available in Asia and Japan only.
^ d Gun-Metal Gray model is only available as part of the MGS4 bundle.

In addition to all of the features of the 20 GB model, the 60 GB model has internal IEEE 802.11 b/g Wi-Fi, multiple flash card readers (SD/MultiMedia Card, CompactFlash Type I/Type II, Microdrive,[57] Memory Stick/PRO/Duo), and a chrome colored trim.[44] In terms of hardware, the 80 GB model released in South Korea is identical to the 60 GB model released in the PAL regions, except for the difference in hard drive size.[58] Like the South Korean and European models, the North American 80 GB model also excludes the PlayStation 2 "Emotion Engine" CPU chip.[59] However, it still keeps the "Graphics Synthesizer" GPU.[60] Due to emulation of the "Emotion Engine", the level of compatibility was reduced[59] (see PlayStation 3 games - Removal of hardware support for more details). The 40 GB, 80 GB (2008), and 160 GB models have two USB ports instead of the four USB ports on other models, and do not include multiple flash card readers, SACD support, or any backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games.[59][18] This was due to the removal of "Graphics Synthesizer" GPU, which stripped the units of all PlayStation 2 based hardware.[46][50]
No official Wi-Fi or flash memory card readers have yet been released by Sony for the 20 GB system, although plans for such add-ons are in place.[61] Nevertheless, as the model features four USB 2.0 ports, wireless networking and flash memory card support can already be obtained through the use of widely available external USB adapters.[59]
It was rumored that the Cell processors in the third-generation PS3s (40 GB) would move from a 90 nm process to the newer 65 nm process,[62] which SCEI CEO Kaz Hirai later confirmed,[63] and later to 45 nm. This change lowers the power consumption of the console and makes it less expensive to produce.[64]

The PlayStation 3's initial production cost is estimated to have been US$805.85 for the 20 GB model and US$840.35 for the 60 GB model.[71] However, they were priced at US$499 and US$599 respectively,[72] meaning that every unit was sold at an estimated loss of $250,[71] contributing to Sony's games division posting an operating loss of ¥232.3 billion (US$1.97 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 2007.[73] In April 2007, soon after these results were published, Ken Kutaragi, President of Sony Computer Entertainment, announced plans to retire. Various news agencies, including The Times[74] and The Wall Street Journal[75] reported that this was due to poor sales, whilst SCEI maintains that Kutaragi had been planning his retirement for six months prior to the announcement.[75]
In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, "the next fiscal year starts in April and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing" and, "that (profitability) is not a definite commitment, but that is what I would like to try to shoot for".[76] However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that the PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008.[77] In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable,[78] despite the fact that a loss is made on every PlayStation 3 console sold.[79] In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for the PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing the PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market.[79]
Since the system's launch, production costs have been reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the Emotion Engine chip and falling hardware costs.[80][81] The cost of manufacturing Cell microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process,[82][81] and Blu-ray diodes have become cheaper to manufacture.[80][83] As of January 2008, each unit costs around $400 to manufacture.[84][85]

Hardware and accessories

Hardware
Main article: PlayStation 3 hardware




A 60 GB PlayStation 3 unit with a box and controller. Note the chrome trim with the logo in silver on this discontinued model.


The PlayStation 3 is convex on its left side when vertical (the top side is convex when horizontal), and has a glossy black finish with the PlayStation logo on the left side.[86] Playstation designer Teiyu Goto stated that the Spider-Man font-inspired logo "was one of the first elements [SCEI president Ken Kutaragi] decided on and the logo may have been the motivating force behind the shape of PS3."[87]
The PlayStation 3 features a slot-loading 2x speed Blu-ray Disc drive for games, Blu-ray movies, DVDs, CDs, and other optical media.[88] It was originally available with hard drives of 20 and 60 GB (only the 60 GB model was available in PAL regions).[17][89] An 80 GB model has since been introduced in NTSC regions,[90] and a 40 GB model has been introduced in all regions.[91][92] All PS3 models have user-upgradeable 2.5" SATA hard drives.[93]
The PlayStation 3 uses the IBM-designed Cell microprocessor as its CPU, utilizing seven of the eight "synergistic processing elements" (often shortened to SPE).[94] The eighth SPE is disabled to improve chip yields (i.e. chips do not have to be discarded if one of the SPEs is defective).[95][96] Only six of the seven SPEs are accessible to developers as one is reserved by the OS.[96] Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX 'Reality Synthesizer', which can output resolutions from 480i/576i SD up to 1080p HD.[88] The PlayStation 3 has 256 MB of XDR main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX.[97]
The system has Bluetooth 2.0, gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 and HDMI 1.3a built in on all currently shipping models.[88] Wi-Fi networking is also built-in on the 40, 60 and 80 GB models while a flash card reader (compatible with Memory Stick, SD/MMC, and CompactFlash/Microdrive media) is built-in on 60 GB and CECHExx 80 GB models.[88][97] The system supports up to 7 controllers that are connected via Bluetooth 2.0 technology.[98]
The PS3's hardware has also been used to build supercomputers for high-performance computing.[99] Terra Soft Solutions has a version of Yellow Dog Linux for the PlayStation 3,[100] and sells PS3s with Linux pre-installed,[101] in single units, and 6 and 32 node clusters.[102] In addition, RapidMind is pushing their stream programming package for the PS3.[103] Also, on January 3, 2007, Dr. Frank Mueller, Associate Professor of Computer Science at NCSU, clustered 8 PS3s. Mueller commented that the 512 MB of system RAM is a limitation for this particular application, and is considering attempting to retrofit more RAM. Software includes: Fedora Core 5 Linux ppc64, MPICH2, OpenMP v 2.5, GNU Compiler Collection and CellSDK 1.1.[104][105][106]
On March 22, 2007, SCE and Stanford University released the Folding@home project for the PlayStation 3.[107] This program allows PS3 owners to lend the computing power of their consoles to help study the physical process of protein folding.

Accessories
See also: PlayStation 3 accessories and DualShock
Numerous accessories for the console have been developed including the wireless Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the BD Remote, the PlayStation Eye camera and the PlayTV DVB-T tuner/digital video recorder accessory.[108][109]
At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced the DualShock 3 (trademarked DUALSHOCK 3), a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with vibration capability included.[110] Hands-on accounts describe the controller as being noticeably heavier than the standard Sixaxis controller, and capable of vibration forces comparable to the DualShock 2.[111] It was released in Japan on November 11, 2007,[112] in North America on April 15, 2008,[113] in Australia on April 24, 2008, in New Zealand on May 9, 2008, in Europe on July 2, 2008,[114] and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on July 4, 2008.

Software

Operating system
Main article: PlayStation 3 system software
Sony has included the ability for the operating system, referred to as System Software, to be updated.[115] The updates can be downloaded from the PlayStation Network directly to the PS3 and subsequently installed or downloaded from the official PlayStation website to a computer, transferred to portable storage media, and subsequently installed on the system. Updates can also be installed from game discs that require the update to run the game.[115]
The PlayStation 3 also includes the ability to install other operating systems,[116] such as Linux.[117]

Graphical user interface

The PlayStation 3 version of the XrossMediaBar (pronounced Cross Media Bar, or abbreviated XMB) includes nine categories of options. These are: Users, Settings, Photo, Music, Video, Game, Network, PlayStation Network, and Friends (similar to the PlayStation Portable media bar). The PS3 includes the ability to store various master and secondary user profiles, manage and explore photos with or without a musical slide show, play music and copy audio CD tracks to an attached storage device, play movies and video files from the hard disk drive, an optional USB mass storage or Flash card, or an optical disc (Blu-ray Disc or DVD-Video), compatibility for a USB keyboard and mouse, and the NetFront web browser supporting in/compatible file download function.[118] Additionally, UPnP media will appear in the respective audio/video/photo categories if a compatible media server is detected on the local network. The Friends menu allows mail with emoticon and attached picture features and video chat which requires an optional PlayStation Eye or EyeToy webcam.[119] The Network menu allows online shopping through the PlayStation Store and connectivity to the PlayStation Portable via Remote Play.[119]

VidZone
Main article: VidZone
VidZone is an online music video service, which allows for free streaming of music videos from the VidZone.tv website. The VidZone catalogue encompasses over 1.5 million tracks, 25,000 music videos and 15,000 realtones,[120] including full access to catalogues from Sony BMG[121] and EMI.[122]
In 2009, VidZone’s service will be extended to the PlayStation 3 video game system in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, allowing users to watch music videos for on their PS3 or streamed to their PSP via Remote Play.[123]

PlayStation Network
Main articles: PlayStation Network and PlayStation Store




Official logo of the PlayStation Network


Sony announced a unified online service for the PlayStation 3 system at the 2006 PlayStation Business Briefing meeting in Tokyo.[124] Sony also confirmed that the service will always be connected,[125] free,[126] and include multiplayer support.[127] When the network launched, the registration interface could only be accessed through the PS3 or PSP system interfaces.[128] This has been changed since to allow users to sign up from the Playstation Network website.
At the Tokyo Game Show on September 21, 2006, it was revealed that users will be able to download some of the thousands of PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles from the PlayStation Network for about US$5–$15, starting with those with the smallest game data.[129]
On May 8, 2007 Sony Computer Entertainment announced PlayStation Network Cards,[130] a form of electronic money that can be used with the Store. PlayStation Network Tickets, available in units of 1,000, 3,000, 5,000, and 10,000 yen, can be purchased at convenience stores throughout Japan.[131] Each ticket contains a 12 alphanumeric code which can be inputted to the PlayStation Network to place credits in the virtual wallet.[132] The tickets are available through electronic kiosks at 26,000 convenience stores, including Lawsons, Family Mart, Daily Yamazaki, Ministop and Sunkus.[133] They are also available at 26,000 post office ATMs, although registration is required first at a special mobile website.[133]
A similar PlayStation Network Card system based on actual cards instead of tickets was introduced in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan in Summer 2007[134] and in Spring 2008 in North America.[135]

PlayStation Home
Main article: PlayStation Home




The PlayStation Home logo


During the 2007 Game Developers Conference, Sony announced PlayStation Home, a virtual community-based service for the PlayStation Network. Home allows users to create a virtual avatar for their PlayStation 3 system.[136][137] Avatars will have their own apartment, known as a "HomeSpace", which can be decorated with items that users can either purchase or receive following various achievements attained from certain games.[136] In the future the service will expand, allowing players to choose from a wider variety of clothing, as well as pets.[137] Home is a Second Life-like experience that allows PlayStation Network users to interact in a virtual world,[138] and acts as a meeting place for users that want to play multiplayer games with others.[138]
A closed beta began in Europe from May 2007 and expanded to other territories soon after,[139] while an open beta was scheduled for availability in October 2007.[138] However, at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony delayed the release of Home to "Spring 2008",[140] and again on April 21, 2008, this time until "Fall 2008".[141] SCEI President and Group CEO Kaz Hirai later stated that the launch was delayed for further testing and feedback evaluation to provide the best possible experience upon launch.[142] The open beta was released on December 11, 2008[143] and is accessible to all PlayStation Network users free of charge directly from the Xross Media Bar (XMB), without the need of a firmware update or PlayStation Store download.[137][138]

PlayStation Portable connectivity




Playing a PlayStation 3 game on the PSP


Main articles: Remote Play and PlayStation Store (PC) for PSP
The PlayStation Portable can connect with the PlayStation 3 in many ways, including in-game connectivity. For example, Formula One Championship Edition, a racing game, was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time rear-view mirror.[144] In addition, it is possible to download PlayStation games to the PlayStation 3 from the PlayStation Store. These games were not originally playable on the PS3. They could only be sent to a PSP, and played using the PSP's PlayStation Emulator. Sony added support for playing downloaded PlayStation titles on PS3 on April 18, 2007, with the update to firmware revision 1.70.[145][146]
Sony has also demonstrated the PSP playing back video content from the PlayStation 3 hard disk across an ad-hoc wireless network. This feature is referred to as Remote Play located under the browser icon on both the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable. Remote play has since expanded to allow remote access to the PS3 via PSP from any wireless access point in the world.[147]

Games
Main article: PlayStation 3 games
The PlayStation 3 launched in North America with 14 titles, with another three being released before the end of 2006.[148] After the first week of sales it was confirmed that Resistance: Fall of Man from Insomniac Games was the top-selling launch game in North America.[149][150] The game was heavily praised by numerous video game websites, including GameSpot and IGN, both of whom awarded it their PlayStation 3 Game of the Year award for 2006.[151][152] Some titles missed the launch window and were delayed until early 2007, such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, F.E.A.R. and Sonic the Hedgehog. During the Japanese launch, Ridge Racer 7 was the top-selling game, while Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire also fared well in sales;[153] both of which were offerings from Namco Bandai. The PlayStation 3 launched in Europe with 24 titles, including ones that were not offered in the North American and Japanese launches, such as Formula One Championship Edition, MotorStorm and Virtua Fighter 5. Resistance: Fall of Man and MotorStorm were the most successful titles of 2007,[154][155] and both games subsequently received sequels in the form of Resistance 2 and MotorStorm: Pacific Rift.[156][157]
At E3 2007, Sony was able to show a number of their upcoming video games for the PlayStation 3, including Heavenly Sword, Lair, Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, Warhawk and Uncharted: Drake's Fortune; all of which were released in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. They also showed off a number of titles that were set for release in 2008 and 2009; most notably Killzone 2, Infamous, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, LittleBigPlanet and SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation.[158] A number of third-party exclusives were also shown, including the highly-anticipated Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots,[159] alongside other high-profile third-party titles such as Grand Theft Auto 4, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Assassin's Creed, Devil May Cry 4 and Resident Evil 5. Two other important titles for the PlayStation 3, Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII, were shown at TGS 2007 in order to appease the Japanese market.[160][161]
Sony have since launched their budget range of PlayStation 3 titles, known as the Greatest Hits range in North America,[162] the Platinum range in Europe[163] and The Best range in Japan.[164] Among the titles available in the budget range include Resistance: Fall of Man, MotorStorm, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, Rainbow Six: Vegas, Call Of Duty 3, Assassin's Creed and Ninja Gaiden Sigma.
As of the December 31, 2008, there have been 155 million games sold for the PlayStation 3.[165]

Stereoscopic 3D
In December 2008 the CTO of Blitz Games announced that they would bring stereoscopic 3D gaming and movie viewing to the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 with their own technology.[166] According to Blitz Games, SCE confirmed that they intend to support stereoscopic 3D games and Blu-ray movies and that the functionality will be introduced to the PlayStation 3 via a firmware update in 2009.[167] This technology was first demonstrated publicly on the PS3 in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future.[168]

Reception




A silver PS3 on showcase in 2006


The PlayStation 3 received generally unfavorable reviews soon after its launch, with many websites and reviewers criticizing its high price and lack of quality launch games.[169][170] However, after a series of price revisions, Blu-ray's victory over HD DVD,[171] and the release of several well received titles, such as Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, the system received better reviews.[citation needed]
The PS3 was given the number-eight spot on PC World magazine’s list of "The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006," where it was criticized for being "Late, Expensive, and Incompatible."[172] GamesRadar ranked the PS3 as the top item in a feature on game-related PR disasters, asking how Sony managed to "take one of the most anticipated game systems of all time and — within the space of a year — turn it into a hate object reviled by the entire internet", but added that despite its problems the system has "untapped potential."[173] Business Week summed up the general opinion by stating that it was "more impressed with what [the PlayStation 3] could do than with what it currently does."[174]
Despite the initial negative press, several websites have given the system very good reviews. CNET United Kingdom praised the system saying, "the PS3 is a versatile and impressive piece of home-entertainment equipment that lives up to the hype ... the PS3 is well worth its hefty price tag."[175] CNET awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10 and voted it as its number one "must-have" gadget,[176] praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games.[177]
In addition, both Home Theater Magazine and Ultimate AV have given the system's Blu-ray playback very favorable reviews, stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone Blu-ray players.[178][179] Also, the Convergence Panel of the European Imaging and Sound Association recognized the PS3 as the best media center product in the 2007/2008 award year.[180][opinion needs balancing]
Hexus Gaming reviewed the PAL version and summed the review up by saying, "...as the PlayStation 3 matures and developers start really pushing it, we’ll see the PlayStation 3 emerge as the console of choice for gaming."[181] At GDC 2007, Shiny Entertainment founder Dave Perry stated, "I think that Sony has made the best machine. It's the best piece of hardware, without question."[182] A second review of the PS3 by Ars Technica in June 2008 gave the console an overall mark of 9/10, while the original launch review marked only 6/10.[183]
