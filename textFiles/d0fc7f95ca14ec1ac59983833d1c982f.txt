Most Evil is an American forensics television program on Investigation Discovery starring forensic psychiatrist Michael Stone from Columbia University. On the show, Stone rates murderers on a scale of evil that he has developed in order to help science understand and thus prevent this type of behavior.
The show features profiles on various murderers, serial killers, and psychopaths. Stone researched hundreds of killers and their methods and motives to develop his hierarchy of "evil." The scale ranges from Category 1, those who kill in self defense, to Category 9, psychopathic jealous lovers, to the "most evil" Category 22, serial torturers and killers. Neurologists, psychologists, and other forensic psychiatrists are interviewed on the show in an attempt to examine and profile the minds of notorious killers. Partial re-enactments are shown along with news footage, evidence, and reports from locals. Neurological, environmental, and genetic factors are examined to help determine what drives a person to kill. Background history and pre-meditation are considered when placing an individual on the scale of evil. The show indirectly deals with the concepts of morality and ethics.
Another similar attempt is Michael Welner's The Depravity Scale.

[edit] The scale of evil


Category
Criteria


01
Those who kill in self-defense and do not show psychopathic tendencies (justifiable homicide)


02
Jealous lovers who, though egocentric or immature, are not psychopathic (crime of passion)


03
Willing companions of killers: aberrant personality — probably impulse-ridden, with antisocial traits


04
Kill in self-defense, but had been extremely provocative towards the victim


05
Traumatized, desperate people who kill abusive relatives and others (like to support a drug habit) but lack significant traits. Genuinely remorseful.


06
Impetuous, hotheaded murderers, yet without marked psychopathic features


07
Highly narcissistic, not distinctly psychopathic people with a psychotic core who kill people close to them (jealousy an underlying motive)


08
Non psychopathic people with smoldering rage who kill when rage is ignited


09
Jealous lovers with psychopathic features


10
Killers of people who were "in the way" or who killed, for example, witnesses (egocentric but not distinctly psychopathic)


11
Psychopathic killers of people "in the way"


12
Power-hungry psychopaths who killed when they were "cornered"


13
Killers with inadequate, rage-filled personalities who "snapped"


14
Ruthlessly self-centered psychopathic schemers


15
Psychopathic "cold-blooded" spree or multiple murders


16
Psychopaths committing multiple vicious acts


17
Sexually perverse serial murderers, torture-murderers (among the males, rape is the primary motive with murder to hide the evidence; Systematic torture is not a primary factor)


18
Torture-murderers with murder the primary motive


19
Psychopaths driven to terrorism, subjugation, intimidation and rape, (short of murder)


20
Torture murderers with torture as the primary motive but in psychotic personalities


21
Psychopaths preoccupied with torture in the extreme, but not known to have committed murder


22
Psychopathic torture-murderers, with torture their primary motive, sexual homicide
