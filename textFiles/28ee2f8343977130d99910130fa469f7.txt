[edit] Early life and education
Khosla read about the founding of Intel in Electronic Engineering Times at the age of fourteen and this inspired him to pursue technology as a career. Khosla went on to receive degrees from the IIT Delhi, India (Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering ), Carnegie Mellon University (Masters in Biomedical Engineering), and Stanford Graduate School of Business (MBA).

[edit] Career

[edit] Sun Microsystems
After graduating from Stanford University in 1980, Khosla along with his Stanford fellows Scott McNealy, Andy Bechtolsheim (another Carnegie Mellon graduate school alumnus), and a UC Berkeley masters degree holder named Bill Joy founded Sun Microsystems. Khosla left Sun in 1985. He then joined the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1986 as a general partner. Khosla is also one of the founders of TiE, The Indus Entrepreneurs, and has guest-edited a special issue of Economic Times (ET), a leading business newspaper in India.

[edit] Post Sun
Khosla "fell in love" with Zaplet.com, and the company has since merged and developed into a governance, risk and compliance leader.[3]
While recognized for several venture "hits," Khosla also played a key role with several of the tech industry's most spectacular failures, including Asera, Zambeel, Dynabook, Excite, and others.
He also invested in an Indian Microfinance NGO, SKS Microfinance, which lends small loans to poor women in rural India.
Khosla was featured on Dateline NBC on Sunday, May 7, 2006. He was discussing the practicality of the use of ethanol as a gasoline substitute. He is known to have invested heavily in ethanol companies, in hopes of widespread adoption. He cites Brazil as an example of a country that has totally ended its dependence on foreign oil.[4]
Khosla was a major funder of Yes on 87's campaign to pass California's Proposition 87, The Clean Energy Initiative, which failed to pass in November, 2006.
In 2006, Khosla founded ck12.org that aims to develop open source textbooks and lower the cost of education in America and the rest of the world. Khosla and his wife Neeru are also relatively substantial donors to the Wikimedia Foundation, in the amount of $500,000.[5]

[edit] Khosla Ventures



This section requires expansion.


In 2004 Khosla formed his own firm, Khosla Ventures.
Khosla Ventures is a venture capital firm focusing on early stage companies in the Internet, computing, mobile, silicon technology and clean technology sectors. Within cleantech, the firm has invested in bio-refineries for energy and bioplastics, solar, battery and other environmentally friendly technologies. Khosla Ventures is based in Menlo Park, California [6] and it was formed in 2004.

[edit] Personal life
He lives in Portola Valley, California, with his wife Neeru and their four daughters-Nina, Vani, Anu and Nealia.
