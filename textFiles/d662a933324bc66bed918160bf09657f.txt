In linguistics, a calque (pronounced /kælk/) or loan translation is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word (Latin: "verbum pro verbo") or root-for-root translation.
For example, the common English phrase "flea market" is a phrase calque that literally translates the French "marché aux puces".[1]
Going in the other direction, from English to French, provides an example of how a compound word may be calqued by first breaking it down into its component roots. The French "gratte-ciel" is a word-coinage inspired by the model of the English "skyscraper" — "gratter" literally translates as "to scrape", and "ciel" translates as "sky".
Used as a verb, "to calque" means to loan-translate from another language so as to create a new lexeme in the target language.
"Calque" itself is a loanword from a French noun, and derives from the verb "calquer" (to trace, to copy).[2] Loan translation is itself a calque of the German "Lehnübersetzung".[3]
Proving a word is a calque sometimes requires more documentation than an untranslated loanword, since in some cases a similar phrase might have arisen in both languages independently. This is less likely to be the case when the grammar of the proposed calque is quite different from that of the language proposed to be borrowing, or the calque contains less obvious imagery.

[edit] Macedonian

Macedonian ракопис (rakopis) calques Latin-derived 'manuscript' and 'handwriting':

Mac. root рака (raka) = Lat. manus = 'hand'
Mac. root пис- (pis-) = Lat. scribo = 'to write'


Macedonian правопис (pravopis) calques Greek-derived 'orthography':

Mac. root право (pravo) = Gr. ορθός (orthos) = 'correct';
Mac. root пис- (pis-) = Gr. γράφειν (graphein) = 'to write'


Macedonian православие (pravoslavie) calques Greek-derived 'orthodoxy':

Mac. root право (pravo) = Gr. ορθός (orthos) = 'correct';
Mac. root славие (slavie) = Gr. δοξα (doxa) = 'glorification'



In more recent times, the Macedonian language has calqued new words from other prestige languages including German, French and English.

Macedonian натчовек (natčovek) = calques German-derived 'overman' (Übermensch)

Mac. root над- (nad-) = Ger. über = 'over'
Mac. root човек (čovek, man) = Ger. mensch = 'people'


Macedonian облакодер (oblakoder) = calques English skyscraper:

Mac. root облак (oblak, cloud)
Mac. root дере (dere, to flay)


Macedonian клучен збор (klučen zbor) = calques English keyword:

Mac. root клуч (kluč, key)
Mac. root збор (zbor, word)



Some words were originally calqued into Russian and then absorbed into Macedonian, considering the close relatedness of the two languages. Therefore, many of these calques can also be considered Russianisms.

[edit] Russian
The poet Aleksandr Pushkin (1799–1837) was perhaps the most influential among the Russian literary figures who would transform the modern Russian language and vastly expand its ability to handle abstract and scientific concepts by importing the sophisticated vocabulary of Western intellectuals.
Although some Western vocabulary entered the language as loanwords — e.g., Italian salvietta, "napkin," was simply Russified in sound and spelling to салфетка (salfetka) — Pushkin and those he influenced most often preferred to render foreign borrowings into Russian by calquing. Compound words were broken down to their component roots, which were then translated piece-by-piece to their Slavic equivalents. But not all of the coinages caught on and became permanent additions to the lexicon; for example, любомудрие (ljubomudrie) was promoted by 19th-century Russian intellectuals as a calque of "philosophy," but the word eventually fell out of fashion, and modern Russian instead uses the loanword философия (filosofija).

Russian любомудрие (ljubomudrie) calqued Greek-derived 'philosophy':

Russ. root любить (ljubit' ) = Gr. φιλεῖν (filein) = 'to love';
Russ. root мудрость (mudrost' ) = Gr. σοφία (sofia) = 'wisdom'


Russian зависимость (zavisimost' ) calques Latin-derived 'dependence':

Russ. root за (za) = Lat. de = 'down from'
Russ. root висеть (viset' ) = Lat. pendere = 'to hang; to dangle'


Russian полуостров (poluostrov) calques German Halbinsel, both meaning 'peninsula':

Russ. root полу- (polu-) = Ger. halb = 'half; semi-'
Russ. root остров (ostrov) = Ger. Insel = 'island'


Russian детский сад (detskij sad) calques German Kindergarten, both literally suggesting 'children's garden'


[edit] Ukrainian

велике спасибі (velyke spasybi) calques Russian большое спасибо (bol'shoe spasibo), both literally "a big thank-you"[citation needed]


[edit] Greek

Διαδίκτυο from English Internet
Τηλεόραση from Television


[edit] Finnish
Since Finnish, a Finno-Ugric language, differs radically in pronunciation and orthography from Indo-European languages, most loans adopted in Finnish either are calques or soon become such as foreign words are translated into Finnish. Examples include:

from Greek: sarvikuono (rhinoceros, from Greek "rinokeros"),
from Latin: viisaudenhammas (wisdom tooth, from Latin "dens sapientiae"),
from English: jalkapallo (English "football", specifically referring to association football),
from English: koripallo (English "basketball"),
from English: kovalevy (English "hard disk"),
from French: kirpputori (flea market, French "marché aux puces"),
from German: lastentarha (German "Kindergarten"),
from German: panssarivaunu (German "Panzerwagen"),
from Swedish: moottoritie (highway, from Swedish "motorväg" and ultimately German "autobahn"),
from Chinese: aivopesu (brainwash, from Chinese "xi nao"),
from Spanish: siniverinen (blue-blooded, from Spanish "de sangre azul")


[edit] Hebrew
When Jews make an aliyah to Israel, they sometimes change their name to a Hebrew calque. For instance, Imi Lichtenfield, founder of the martial art Krav Maga, became Imi Sde-Or. Both last names mean "light field".

mesilat barzel (railway) from German Eisenbahn
iton (newspaper) from German and Yiddish zeitung
tappuach adamah (potato) from French pomme-de-terre
gan yeladim from German Kindergarten
kaduregel (כדורגל) (football, specifically association football) from English football
