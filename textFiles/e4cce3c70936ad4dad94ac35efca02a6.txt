Biomes are climatically and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms, [1] and are often referred to as ecosystems. Biomes are defined by factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation (quasi-equilibrium state of the local ecosystem). An ecosystem has a habitat and a biome is a major habitat type. A major habitat type, however, is a compromise, as it has an intrinsic inhomogeneity.
The biodiversity characteristic of each biome, especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms, is a function of abiotic factors and the biomass productivity of the dominant vegetation. In terrestrial biomes, species diversity tends to correlate positively with net primary productivity, moisture availability, and temperature.[2]
Ecoregions are grouped into both biomes and ecozones.
A fundamental classification of biomes is into:

Terrestrial (land) biomes
Freshwater biomes
Marine biomes

Biomes are often known in English by local names. For example, a Temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as steppe in central Asia, prairie in North America, and pampas in South America. Tropical grasslands are known as savanna in Australia, whereas in Southern Africa it is known as veldt (from Afrikaans).
Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection, especially under an individual nation's Biodiversity Action Plan.
Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes. Among the important climatic factors are:

latitude: Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, tropical.
humidity: humid, semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid.

seasonal variation: Rainfall may be distributed evenly throughout the year or be marked by seasonal variations.
dry summer, wet winter: Most regions of the earth receive most of their rainfall during the summer months; Mediterranean climate regions receive their rainfall during the winter months.


elevation: Increasing elevation causes a distribution of habitat types similar to that of increasing latitude.

The most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to latitude (or temperature zoning) and humidity. Biodiversity generally increases away from the poles towards the equator and increases with humidity.

[edit] Bailey system
Robert G. Bailey almost developed a biogeographical classification system for the United States in a map published in 1876. Bailey subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of South America in 1981 and the world in 1989. The Bailey system is based on climate and is divided into seven domains (Polar, Humid Temperate, Dry, Human, and Humid Tropical), with further divisions based on other climate characteristics (subarctic, warm temperate, hot temperate, and subtropical; marine and continental; lowland and mountain).[3]

100 Polar Domain

120 Tundra Division
M120 Tundra Division - Mountain Provinces
130 Subarctic Division
M130 Subarctic Division - Mountain Provinces

[edit] WWF system
A team of biologists convened by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) developed an ecological land classification system that identified fourteen biomes,[4] called major habitat types, and further divided the world's land area into 867 terrestrial ecoregions. Each terrestrial Ecoregion has a specific EcoID, fomat XXnnNN (XX is the Ecozone, nn is the Biome number, NN is the individual number). This classification is used to define the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the WWF as priorities for conservation. The WWF major habitat types are:

01 Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (tropical and subtropical, humid)
02 Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests (tropical and subtropical, semi-humid)
03 Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (tropical and subtropical, semi-humid)
04 Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests (temperate, humid)
05 Temperate coniferous forests (temperate, humid to semi-humid)
06 Boreal forests/taiga (subarctic, humid)
07 Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands (tropical and subtropical, semi-arid)
08 Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands (temperate, semi-arid)
09 Flooded grasslands and savannas (temperate to tropical, fresh or brackish water inundated)
10 Montane grasslands and shrublands (alpine or montane climate)
11 Tundra (Arctic)
12 Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub or Sclerophyll forests (temperate warm, semi-humid to semi-arid with winter rainfall)
13 Deserts and xeric shrublands (temperate to tropical, arid)
14 Mangrove (subtropical and tropical, salt water inundated)


[edit] Freshwater biomes
According to the World Wildlife Fund, the following are classified as freshwater biomes: [5]




Large lakes
Large river deltas
Polar freshwaters
Montane freshwaters
Temperate coastal rivers
Temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands




Temperate upland rivers
Tropical and subtropical coastal rivers

Endolithic Biome




[edit] Anthropogenic biomes
Humans have fundamentally altered global patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. As a result, vegetation forms predicted by conventional biome systems are rarely observed across most of Earth's land surface. Anthropogenic biomes provide an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere based on global patterns of sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems, including agriculture, human settlements, urbanization, forestry and other uses of land. Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward in ecology and conservation by recognizing the irreversible coupling of human and ecological systems at global scales and moving us toward an understanding how best to live in and manage our biosphere and the anthropogenic biosphere we live in.

[edit] Other biomes
The Endolithic biome, consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock pores and cracks, kilometers beneath the surface, has only recently been discovered and does not fit well into most classification schemes.
