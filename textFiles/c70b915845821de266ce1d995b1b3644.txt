Rushkoff graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University. He moved to Los Angeles and pursued a Master of Fine Arts in Directing from California Institute of the Arts. Later he took up a post-graduate fellowship from the American Film Institute.
He formerly taught at the Esalen Institute[citation needed]. Today, he teaches media theory at New York University's (NYU) Interactive Telecommunications Program. Rushkoff is known for being an active member of the cyberpunk movement and was the online associate of Timothy Leary. His views on cyberculture and the media made him a sought after advisor and consultant with many organizations and companies, including the United Nations Commission on World Culture and the Sony corporation.
He is an advocate for new technologies, especially open source uses of technology. He is also a founding member of Technorealism.[citation needed] This extends to his broader philosophy as the founder of an online community for discussion of Judaism and related issues, called Open Source Judaism. In the book Media Virus, he expounds on various terms such as meta-media and tactical media especially in relation to popular culture media such as television. He has also criticized the current economic system based on centralized currencies, corporations and banks as "a Ponzi scheme".[1]
In 2003 Rushkoff was keyboard player for a short-term line-up of Psychic TV.
Rushkoff currently serves on the board of advisors of The Hyperwords Company Ltd of the UK, which works to make the web more usefully interactive and which has produced the free Firefox Add-On called 'Hyperwords'. [2]
