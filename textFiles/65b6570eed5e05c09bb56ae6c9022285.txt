[edit] Archiving only


File extension(s)[1]
MIME type[2]
Official name[3]
Platform[4]
Description


.a, .ar

Unix Archiver
Unix-like
The traditional archive format on Unix-like systems, now used mainly for the creation of static libraries.


.cpio
application/x-cpio
cpio
Unix-like
RPM files consist of metadata concatenated with (usually) a cpio archive. Newer RPM systems also support other archives, as cpio is becoming obsolete.


.shar
application/x-shar
Shell archive
Unix-like
A self-extracting archive that uses the Bourne shell (sh).


.LBR

.LBR
MS-DOS
A system for storing multiple files. LBR archives typically contained files processed by SQ, or the archive itself was compressed with SQ. LBR archives that were compressed with SQ ended with the extension .LQR


.lbr


Commodore 64/128
A library format used primarily on the Commodore 64 and 128 lines of computers. This bears no resemblance to the MS-DOS LBR format. While library files were quick to implement (a number of programs exist to work with them) they are crippled in that they cannot grow with use: once a file has been created it cannot be amended (files added, changed or deleted) without recreating the entire file.


.tar
application/x-tar
Tape archive
Unix-like
A common archive format used on Unix-like systems. Generally used in conjunction with compressors such as gzip, bzip2 or compress to create .tar.gz, .tar.bz or .tar.Z files.



[edit] Compression only


File extension(s)[1]
MIME type[2]
Official name[3]
Platform[4]
Description


.bz2
application/x-bzip2
bzip2
Unix-like
An open source, patent- and royalty-free compression format. The compression algorithm is a Burrows-Wheeler transform followed by a move-to-front transform and finally Huffman coding


.F

Freeze/melt[1]
QNX4
Old compressor for QNX4 OS. The compression algorithm is a modified LZSS, with an adaptive Huffman coding.


.gz
application/x-gzip
gzip
Unix-like
GNU Zip, the primary compression format used by Unix-like systems. The compression algorithm is DEFLATE.


.lz
application/x-lzip
lzip
Unix-like
An alternate LZMA algorithm implementation, with support for checksums and ident bytes.


.lzma

lzma
Unix-like
The LZMA compression algorithm as used by 7-Zip


.lzo

lzop
Unix-like
An implementation of the LZO data compression algorithm


.rz

rzip
Unix-like
A compression program designed to do particularly well on very large files containing long distance redundancy.


.sfark

sfark
Windows compress/decompress- Linux and Mac OS X decompress only
A compression program designed to do high compression on SF2 files (SoundFont)


.?Q?

SQ
CP/M and MS-DOS
Squeeze: A program which compressed files. A file which was "squeezed" had the middle initial of the name changed to "Q", so that a squeezed text file would end with .TQT, a squeezed executable would end with .CQM or .EQE. Typically used with .LBR archives, either by storing the squeezed files in the archive, or by storing the files uncompressed and then compressing the archive, which would have a name ending in ".LQR".


.z
application/x-compress
pack
Unix-like
The old Huffman coding compression format.


.Z
application/x-compress
compress
Unix-like
The traditional LZW compression format.


.??_


MS-DOS/Windows
Compression format(s) used by some Windows and MS-DOS install programs. MS-DOS includes expand.exe to uncompress its install files. The compressed files are created with a matching compress.exe command. The compression algorithm is LZSS.

Currently, Safari is the only browser that supports this form of extraction; however, the images can be manually extracted as well. This format can also be password-protected or encrypted with 128-bit or 256-bit AES encryption.

Multiple
Old archive versions only[7]
A proprietary archive format, second in popularity to .zip files.


.rk

RK and WinRK [3]
Multiple
Multiple
No
The format from a commercial archiving package. Odd among commercial packages in that they focus on incorporating experimental algorithms with the highest possible compression (at the expense of speed and memory), such as PAQ, PPMD and PPMZ (PPMD with unlimited-length strings), as well as a proprietary algorithms.


.sda

Self Dissolving ARChive.
Commodore 64, Commodore 128
Commodore 64, Commodore 128
N/A
SDAs refer to Self Dissolving ARC files, and are based on the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 versions of ARC, originally written by Chris Smeets. While the files share the same extension, they are not compatible between platforms. That is, an SDA created on a Commodore 64 but run on a Commodore 128 in Commodore 128 mode will crash the machine, and vice-versa. The intended successor to SDA is SFX.


.sea

sea
Mac OS
Mac OS (implicitly)

A pre-Mac OS X Self-Extracting Archive format. StuffIt, Compact Pro, Disk Doubler and others could create .sea files, though the StuffIt versions were the most common.

Scifer Archive with internal header


.sfx

Self Extracting Archive
Commodore 64, Commodore 128
Commodore 64, Commodore 128
N/A
SFX is a Self Extracting Archive which uses the LHArc compression algorithm. It was originally developed by Chris Smeets on the Commodore platform, and runs primarily using the CS-DOS extension for the Commodore 128. Unlike it's predecessor SDA, SFX files will run on both the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 regardless of which machine they were created on.

[edit] Footnotes

^ a b c d File extensions may differ across platforms. The case of these extensions may differ on case-insensitive platforms.
^ a b c d MIME media types may be conjectural. Very few have been officially registered with the IANA. Compression-only formats should often be denoted by the media type of the uncompressed data, with a content coding indicating the compression format.
^ a b c d Official names may be disputed.
^ a b c d Creation platform indicates the platform(s) under which a format can be created.
^ Restoration platform indicates the platform(s) under which a format can be restored/extracted. Most file formats can be understood by more than one platform.
^ "Restoring with free software" indicates whether the format can be restored using an extraction tool that is free software.
^ 7-zip uses a proprietary plugin under "unRAR license"(this license is LGPL with a restriction that it cannot be used to recover RAR compression format) for the newer archives while rest of 7-zip is free software under LGPL license.
