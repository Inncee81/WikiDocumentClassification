From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Winners of the Hugo Award for best science fiction or fantasy novel, along with all the nominees, are presented here. Awards given in one year are for works published during the previous calendar year. A novel is considered to be 40,000 words or longer. A Hugo for Best Novel was first awarded in 1953, following in subsequent years starting from 1955 although no awards for specific fiction pieces were given out in 1957.
Robert Heinlein has received the most total Hugos for Best Novel, with five wins (including one Retro Hugo) and eleven total nominations. Lois McMaster Bujold has received four Hugos on eight nominations; the only other authors to win more than twice are Vernor Vinge and Isaac Asimov (including one Retro Hugo), who won three times apiece. Larry Niven and Robert J. Sawyer have both been nominated eight times, but each has only won once. Ten other authors have won the award twice.
Vernor and Joan D. Vinge are the only married couple to have both won Hugo Awards for Best Novel (although they have since divorced).
Additional Hugo Awards for fiction are given for pieces of shorter lengths in the short story, novelette and novella categories.

[edit] Retro Hugos
Retro Hugos were awarded 50 years after years in which World Conventions didn't give awards — note: no "Best Novel" Hugo was awarded at the 1957 convention, but Hugos were awarded in other categories, hence there was no "Retro Hugo" for 1957 awarded in 2007.
