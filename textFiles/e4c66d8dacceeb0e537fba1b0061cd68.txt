[edit] Functions
The basic functions of Help Authoring Tools can be divided into the following categories:

[edit] File input
HATs obtain their source text either by importing it from a file produced by another program, or by allowing the author to create the text within the tool by using an editor. File formats that can be imported vary from HAT to HAT, though they can include such formats as ASCII, HTML and Microsoft Word, and compiled Help formats such as Microsoft WinHelp and Microsoft Compressed HTML Help.

[edit] Help output
The output from a HAT can be either a compiled Help file in a format such as WinHelp (*.HLP) or Microsoft Compiled HTML (*.CHM), or noncompiled file formats such as Adobe PDF, XML, or HTML.

[edit] Auxiliary functions
Some HATs provide extra functions such as:

Automatic or assisted Index generation
Automatic Table of Contents
Spelling checker
Image editing
Image hotspot editing
Import and export of text in XML files, for exchange with computer-assisted translation programs
