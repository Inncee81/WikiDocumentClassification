Alfresco is an Enterprise content management system for Microsoft Windows and Unix-like operating systems. Alfresco comes in two flavours. Alfresco LABS is free software, GPL licensed open source and open standards, but never officially stable. Alfresco Enterprise Edition is commercially / proprietary licensed open source, open standards and enterprise scale. Its design is geared towards users who require a high degree of modularity and scalable performance. Alfresco includes a content repository, an out-of-the-box web portal framework for managing and using standard portal content, a CIFS interface that provides file system compatibility on Microsoft Windows and Unix-like operating systems, a web content management system capable of virtualizing webapps and static sites via Apache Tomcat, Lucene indexing, and jBPM workflow. The Alfresco system is developed using Java technology.

[edit] History
Alfresco was founded in 2005 by John Newton, co-founder of Documentum and John Powell, former COO of Business Objects. Its investors include the investment firms SAP, Accel Partners and Mayfield Fund. The original technical staff consisted of principal engineers from Documentum, and Oracle. While Alfresco's product was initially focused on document management, in May 2006, it announced[2] its intention to expand into web content management by acquiring senior technical and managerial staff from Interwoven; this included its VP of Web Content Management, two principal engineers, and a member of its user interface team. In 2007, Alfresco hired the principal sales engineer from Vignette.
In addition to its main website[3], Alfresco's software may also be downloaded from SourceForge.
