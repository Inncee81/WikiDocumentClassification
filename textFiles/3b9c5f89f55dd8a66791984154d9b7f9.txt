[edit] History
The FFRF was co-founded by Anne Nicol Gaylor and her daughter Annie Laurie Gaylor in 1976 and was incorporated nationally in 1978.[2] It is supported by over 13,000 members.[1] It is run out of an 1855 building at the corner of West Washington Avenue and North Henry Street in Madison, Wisconsin, which once was a church rectory. The organization has a minimum annual membership fee of $40. According to the 2007 IRS tax Form-990 found on Guidestar.org, the foundation has a fund balance of over $5.5 million (US) and received over $581,000 (US) in membership dues. The foundation uses this money primarily to pay legal fees in cases supporting the separation of church and state that involve governmental entities, but it also has a paid staff of four, distributes advertisements and sends out news publications to members.[2]
Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, is the author of Women Without Superstition : No Gods - No Masters (ISBN 1-877733-09-1) and edits the FFRF newspaper Freethought Today. Her husband, Dan Barker, author of Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist (ISBN 1-877733-07-5) is a musician and songwriter, a former Pentecostal Christian minister, and co-president of the FFRF.
On October 12, 2007, the Freedom From Religion Foundation began its three-day annual conference. Speakers included Christopher Hitchens, Katha Pollitt, Julia Sweeney, Ellery Schempp, and Matthew LaClair. The event, held in Madison, Wisconsin, marked the foundation's 30th annual conference and was attended by over 650 members.

[edit] Litigation
Wins

FFRF v. Indiana Family & Social Services - May 2, 2007 challenge of the creation of a chaplaincy for the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA). The FSSA hired Pastor Michael L. Latham, a Baptist minister, in 2006, at a salary of $60,000 a year. In September 2007, in response to FFRF's suit, Indiana ended the program.[3]

Winning a lawsuit barring direct taxpayer subsidy of religious schools
Removing Ten Commandments monuments and crosses from public land

[edit] State Capitol signs

[edit] Wisconsin State Capitol
The FFRF maintains a sign in the Wisconsin State Capitol during the winter holiday season, which reads:[9]


“
At this season of the Winter Solstice may reason prevail.
There are no gods, no devils, no angels, no heaven or hell.
There is only our natural world.
Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds.

”



[edit] Washington State Capitol
A plaque with the same text as the Wisconsin State Capitol sign was displayed for the 2008 holiday season at the state capitol in Olympia, Washington, next to a nativity scene.[10][11] The sign was stolen and then later found and returned to the state capitol.[12] The addition of the sign incited a large number of individuals and groups to request other additions, such as a Festivus pole[13], a request by the Westboro Baptist Church for a sign stating "Santa Claus will take you to hell" (among other things)[14], a sign paying homage to the Flying Spaghetti Monster [14], and many others. The sudden influx of requests led Catholic League president Bill Donohue to weigh in harshly[15], and has led many to call for a removal of all religious material whatsoever in the state capitol.

[edit] Freethought Radio
Called the "only weekly Freethought radio broadcast anywhere", Freethought Radio on The Mic 92.1 FM is live every Saturday from 11 a.m. - 12 p.m. CDT in Madison, Wisconsin. It also appears on Air America. It is hosted by the co-presidents of FFRF, Dan Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor. A podcast archive is also available at the FFRF website. Regular features include "Theocracy Alert" and "Freethinkers Almanac". The latter highlights historic freethinkers, many of whom are also songwriters. The show's intro and outro makes use of John Lennon's "Imagine", which is notable for its antireligious theme.
