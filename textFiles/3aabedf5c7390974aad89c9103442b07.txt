Viktor Schauberger (30 June 1885 – 25 September 1958) was an Austrian forester/forest warden, naturalist, philosopher, inventor and Biomimicry experimenter.
The inventor of what he called "implosion technology", Schauberger developed his own theories based on fluidic vortices and movement in nature. He built actuators for airplanes, ships, silent turbines [1], self-cleaning pipes and equipment for cleaning and so-called "refinement" of water to create spring water, [2] which he used as a remedy.
Schauberger's theories, including his Theory of Everything appear not to have received acceptance in the mainstream scientific community, as replication proves either too difficult or results vary from previously published data. However , Schauberger's work remains an inspiration to many people in the Green Movement for his own observations of nature and his encouragement for others to do the same .

[edit] Biography

[edit] Early years
Viktor Schauberger was born in Holzschlag, Austria, to a long line of Austrian foresters that could be traced back to early germanic tribes with views on and concepts of nature entirely different than the ones known to us nowadays. Creek and river flow fascinated him during his youth. He went on to develop a basic theory that contains a twofold movement principle for such phenomena.
His first idea was brought on by trout. The fact that they could use so little force to go against the current inspired him to study the force that allowed such effortless motion. His study of trout concluded in the theory of natural vortices.
Schauberger also spent much time studying algae on the river bed. He noticed the bubbles on their surface and in his journals, which still exist today at the Schauberger family home, appears to be the first to describe photosynthesis in all of it's scientific detail.
Schauberger's second major theory was in the structure of water. He believed that water is at its densest when cold (at +4C water anomaly point) (and at the time of a full moon), and that there are many layers in the structure of flowing water. He claimed that nature creates vortices to create equilibriums. He further claimed that our current form of energy production/consumption scatters matter into disequilibrium. His studies were not approved by science at the time, even when his ideas were put into practice.[citation needed]
In 1922 for Adolf I, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe, Schauberger designed and had built several log flumes which reduced the timber transport costs to one tenth the previous cost.[3] In 1924, Viktor Schauberger became a Public Council consultant for the log flumes for the Austrian state. He started construction of three large plants in Austria. In 1926, he undertook research at a timber flotation installation in Neuberg an der Mürz in Styria. In 1929 Schauberger submitted his first applications for patents in the fields of water engineering and turbine construction. He conducted research on how to artificially generate centripetal movement in various types of machines. He proposed a means of utilising hydroelectric power by a jet turbine. The log flumes used for timber flotation allegedly disregarded the Archimedes' principle, i.e., Schauberger was allegedly able to transport heavier-than-water objects by creating a centripetal movement (making the timber spin around its own axis, by special guiding-vanes which caused the water to spiral). Professor Philipp Forchheimer was sent to study the log flumes. Professor Forchheimer in 1930-1931 later published with Schauberger a series of articles in "Die Wasserwirtschaft", the Austrian Journal of Hydrology.[citation needed]

[edit] World War II
In 1934 Viktor was meeting with Hitler[citation needed], and had discussions about fundamental principles of agriculture, forestry and water engineering.[citation needed] Schauberger is believed to have lent his ideas in order to aid the German Reich. Although whether this was under duress or willingly is still a matter of debate.[citation needed]
In 1941, an intrigue caused by the Viennese Association of Engineers[citation needed] resulted in Schauberger's enforced confinement in a mental hospital in Mauer-Öhling, under continuous observation by the SS.[citation needed] In Augsburg, Schauberger worked with Messerschmitt on engine cooling systems and was in correspondence with designer Heinkel about aircraft engines.[citation needed]
In 1944, Schauberger continued to develop his Repulsine machine at the Technical College of Engineering at Rosenhügel in Vienna. By May 1945 a prototype had been constructed.
In 1945 Schauberger started to work on his "Klimator". The function of the Klimator is to cool and warm the air in living spaces. [4]
At the end of the war Schauberger was apprehended by US intelligence agents, and kept in custody for 9 months. They confiscated all his documents and prototypes, and interrogated him to determine his activities during the war.[5]
After the war Schauberger continued his work, leading to water-based power generation through vortex action in a closed cycle, the "Spiral Plough", an "Apparatus for soil cultivation made of copper" and tests with "spiral pipes".

[edit] Later years
In 1952, at Stuttgart Technical University, Schauberger claimed that tests were carried out by Prof. Franz Popel, on behalf of the West German government, to determine the validity of his ideas on water movement. Tests were performed on Schauberger's specially designed copper pipes, which had a conical, spiral, rifled shape, with apparent success confirming Schauberger's idea.
In 1958 Schauberger was approached by Karl Gerchsheimer and Robert Donner, with an invitation to come to the US to further develop his inventions.
Schauberger spent several months in the US writing articles and drawing sketches, then returned to Austria. He died in Linz, Austria, on September 25 1958, 5 days after having returned to Linz.

[edit] Controversy
Schauberger has become well known as his therories have become part of an internet conspiracy theory in which people say they created 'free energy devices' with Schauberger technology that the US government are "covering up". However, these devices have failed to work under scientific scrutiny and violate the simple, fundamental physical law of Conservation of energy.

[edit] Implosion Magazine
Implosion is a quarterly magazine founded in 1958 by Aloys Kokaly, generally aimed at the lay reader, which is still published quarterly or semi-annually by Klaus Rauber. It has been, without doubt, the richest repository of Viktor Schauberger's writing (in German), and has been the source of substantial portions of the Eco-Technology series.

[edit] Films
In 1930, "Tragendes Wasser" was filmed, showing the functioning of the log flumes. Three documentaries in English dealing with the life and works of Viktor Schauberger are in existence:

"Nature Was My Teacher" - Borderland Science Research Foundation - narrated by Tom Brown (1993)
"Sacred Living Geometries" - narrated by Callum Coats (1995)
"Extraordinary Nature of Water" - narrated by Callum Coats (2000)
