Yonaguni






Location of Yonaguni


Yonaguni (与那国島 ,Yonaguni-jima?), or 渡難島 (ドゥナンチマ) Dunan-chima in the local Yonaguni language, is the westernmost island of Japan.
The local language, which is incomprehensible to Japanese speakers, and even to speakers of other Ryukyu languages, is still spoken by a few elderly inhabitants. The native name for the island, Dunan, is cognate with the element Yona- in the Japanese name.

[edit] Geography




Marker for Japan's westernmost point, Cape Irizaki


Yonaguni lies 125 kilometers (78 mi) from the east coast of Taiwan at the end of the Ryukyu Islands chain, which lies between the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean proper.
The island has an area of 28.88 km² (11.2 sq mi), a population around 1700, an annual mean air temperature of 23.9°C, and annual precipitation of 3000 mm. All islands are under jurisdiction of the town of Yonaguni, Yaeyama Gun, Okinawa and has three towns: Sonai, Kubura and Higawa. It was incorporated under the control of the Ryūkyū royal court in 1610.
Yonaguni, more specifically Cape Irizaki 24°26′58″N 122°56′01″E﻿ / ﻿24.44944°N 122.93361°E﻿ / 24.44944; 122.93361﻿ (Yonaguni (West)) at the western tip of the island, is the westernmost point of Japan. Taiwan is said to be visible from Irizaki on a clear day.

[edit] History
Yonaguni was part of the continent until the last ice age. In the 12th century, it was incorporated to the Ryūkyū Kingdom until the 17th century and then incorporated into the Japanese han of Satsuma. By 1879, the island was formally incorporated into Japan. Until the early 20th century, Yonaguni was part of the larger Yaeyama village, which included the neighboring Yaeyama Islands, but then became an independent village in 1948. From 1945 to 1972, it was occupied by the United States and was then returned to Japan to form a part of Okinawa Prefecture.
On May 4, 1998, a part of the island was destroyed by a submarine earthquake.

[edit] Notable features
Yonaguni is known in Japan for the hanazake, a 120-proof rice-based distilled beverage (awamori) produced only on the island.
The island is also the only natural habitat of a distinctive horse breed, the Yonaguni horse.
Yonaguni is a popular diver's attraction because of the large numbers of hammerhead sharks that gather in the surrounding waters during winter.
In the 1980s, divers discovered a striking underwater rock formation off the southernmost point of the island. This so-called Yonaguni Monument has staircase-like terraces with flat sides and sharp corners. On account of those features, some scholars believe it is an artificial (or artificially modified) structure, thousands of years old.

[edit] Transportation
