Metalocalypse is an American animated television series on Adult Swim created by Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha that premiered in August 2006.
The show parodies other "band" and supernatural programs, combining dark comedy and Apocalyptic intrigue in following the exploits of the part-American/part-Scandinavian death metal band Dethklok. The episodes follow the band's everyday life, with a Dethklok song being a common feature near the end of every episode.
The music is written by guitarist/creator Brendon Small, is credited to the band, and is featured in most episodes including actual guitar-fingerings and other band-movements of the characters.

[edit] Overview
In the series, Dethklok is a band which enjoys a popularity level unheard of in reality, ranking as the twelfth largest economy on Earth by the second season. Its popularity is such that impressionable fans will do anything its songs tell them to, even if that means death, which is usually the case. In "Dethgov", fans of Dethklok murder the governor of Florida after he disrespects Nathan, then they proceed to elect Nathan governor in a landslide write-in victory. If Dethklok endorses a product or service, competitors are quickly driven out of business. Organizations worldwide, ranging from governments to businesses, go out of their way to avoid hindering Dethklok, to the point that the band is allowed to maintain its own police force and can get away with any crime imaginable with virtually no repercussions.
The members of Dethklok tends to cause disaster wherever they travel, and anything remotely associated with them likewise tends to attract civil unrest simply by existing. Dethklok concerts are so notoriously violent that those attending are required to sign "pain waivers" at the entrance, releasing the band from legal liability in the very likely case they are killed or maimed. For example, in the premiere episode, Dethklok's concert begins with a giant metal box that serves as the band's stage being airlifted and parachuted onto location. It misses the landing area and crushes much of the audience, both by virtue of its landing and subsequent opening. Several searing hot coffee-and-cream pitchers are also deliberately poured on the crowd by the band's special-effects team, burning the crowd's skin off (to fit with the "face-melting" guitar solo in the death metal-styled coffee jingle being played by the band). In another episode ("Dethtroll"), Dethklok accidentally summons a gigantic and extremely destructive Finnish lake troll after taking "lyrics" from a Finnish book of necronomic spells for a song.
The members of Dethklok are generally portrayed as sociopathic and inept in all things non-musical except for negotiating their own contracts. They have unconcerned, apathetic, and often oblivious attitudes toward the violence that occurs around them - they even approve of or are artistically pleased by death or mayhem. The band members share an obsession with the dark and morbid, often choosing whether or not to do something based on how "brutal" or "metal" they believe it to be. The band members also have a great love of money, and are wasteful and unappreciative with material possessions. The band members are shown to care very little about how they spend their money just as long as they have it. All members of the group suffer from extreme alcoholism, and references to drug use are not uncommon; Pickles is the worst offender among them, although all members have addictive personalities. They are clueless about the real world and, despite their vast wealth and success, have self-esteem issues which manifest through various behaviors and surface to varying degrees during the show. All members are also shown to have repressed issues with their families which greatly affect their emotional states and psychological health. This also drives their underlying "creative rage" they express through their metal music. They all display a discomfort with emotional intimacy and maintain a repressed loathing for each other through the use of insulting comments and demeaning jokes. Despite this, they have an insular and notably codependent relationship with each other, rarely spending time apart or making decisions on their own.
The band only functions because it is managed by a clean-cut, ordinary-looking businessman named Charles Foster Ofdensen, who lives with the band in Mordhaus. Ofdensen appears to run every "business" aspect of the band, ranging from legal counsel to finances. As the brains behind the band, Ofdensen operates in an understated, business-like manner. He is remarkably patient and professional when dealing with Dethklok despite their ignorance and frequent rudeness toward him, apparently tolerating their "artistic eccentricity" - as well as in difference to their immense wealth and market-value. In spite of his unassuming appearance, Ofdensen is just as inclined to violence as the band is, if not more so since he willfully engages in it rather than merely being indifferent to it. He often gives specific orders to assault, torture, and kill those who threaten Dethklok with no hesitation or remorse.
The band's unnatural popularity and trail of destruction has attracted the attention of an Illuminati-style group, known as "The Tribunal", which is dedicated to monitoring Dethklok's activity and preventing it from becoming too powerful; typically, episodes involve the Tribunal attempting to maintain and perpetuate public ignorance and rampant consumerism whenever Dethklok's antics inadvertently threaten to upset the status quo. The Tribunal, led by a mysterious character named "Mr. Salacia", works off the premise that Dethklok's unusual powers are the result of an ancient Sumerian prophecy about an "Apocalypse of Metal". General Krozier, the military leader in the group, wants to kill the band, but is constantly held back by Salacia from doing so. Most episodes show the Tribunal attempting to covertly thwart the band by calling in various "specialists", such as "military pharmaceutical psychotropic drug manufacturers", "celebrity depression experts", or various legally compromised characters who attempt to infiltrate the group.

[edit] Series development




Metalocalypse crew at Titmouse, Inc. in Hollywood, California,


As Home Movies had ended its run in 2004, Brendon Small started hanging out with writer friend Tommy Blacha. They went to metal shows around the same time they were both trying to pitch shows to different networks. This was how they came up with the idea of doing a show about a metal band that was 100 times more popular than The Beatles. They came up with the storyline, wrote a theme song and had friend Jon Schnepp design the characters. The series was originally called Deathclock, but the name could not be used due to an existing trademark. The show and the main characters' band were then renamed Dethklok. The show's title was then extended to Dethklok Metalocalypse, although the starring band still retained the name Dethklok. The title was finally shortened to Metalocalypse because the extended show title was too complicated. They pitched the show to Adult Swim, which was greenlighted in 2005 with a 20-episode contract.[1] [2][3]

[edit] Broadcast history
The show's first season consists of 20 11-minute episodes, the first of which premiered on the Adult Swim Video on August 4, 2006 and on Adult Swim proper the following Sunday. Metalocalypse was renewed for a second season consisting of 20 episodes which began airing September 23, 2007, two days before the CD release of The Dethalbum. An updated version of the Deththeme was featured in the second season as well. The Metalocalypse premiere was the #1 rated show in its time slot among males aged 18–34, and earned the network's best premiere delivery and ratings to date in 2006. Among the top ad-supported basic cable programs of the week, Metalocalypse ranked #12 among men 18-34 and #6 among men 18-24. The series premiere ranked #30 for the week among adults 18-34.[4]
At San Diego Comic Con 2008, Tommy Blacha confirmed that the show would be renewed for a third season[5] which, according to a January [adult swim] bump, is supposed to premiere in the fall of 2009.[6]

[edit] Musical references
Several references are made throughout the series to metal/rock musicians and musical acts.

There are numerous references made concerning Cannibal Corpse, most notably the grocery store scene in The Curse of Dethklok with Nathan on the PA system, and the scene in the library in Dethcarraldo.
The episode Dethtroll is likely inspired by Finntroll. Another possible inspiration is Children of Bodom, whose name was inspired by a well-known series of murders at Lake Bodom in Espoo, Finland, the same town in which Mustakrakish the lake troll emerges.
The grocery store is named after the band Finntroll, seen in The Curse of Dethklok and Dethfashion.
The fast food joint, Dimmu Burger, is a play on the band name Dimmu Borgir.
The restaurant is named after Norwegian black metal act Burzum.
In Dethfam, the Putt and Stuff golf course is named after black metal band Marduk, and the medical supplies store is named after black metal band Gorgoroth.
In Go Forth and Die, the high school Nathan attends to get his GED, Carpathian Forest High, is named after the band Carpathian Forest.
In Dethstars:

The show Dating Penelope, that Murderface makes a guest appearance on, has actors credited that are named after Vrangsinn of Carpathian Forest, Cronos of Venom, and Asesino.
Mr. Grishnackh is named after Varg Vikernes' stage name, Count Grishnackh.
Behemoth Productions is named after the Polish blackened death metal band Behemoth. The producer, Adam Nergal, is a combination of Behemoth's lead singer's real name (Adam Darski) and stage name (Nergal).
Character J.F. Amarth may possibly be named after the band Amon Amarth.


Pickles' old band, Snakes 'n' Barrels is a play on the band name Guns N' Roses.
The character Rikki Kixx is a spoof of Nikki Sixx.
In Dethcarraldo:

One of the fighter planes is referred to as Hellhammer.
The supply store is named after Marduk.


In Dethrace, the Japanese driving instructor, "Mr. Gojira", and his driving school, entitled "Gojira Driving School" are both named after the French metal band Gojira. Gojira is also the Japanese name for Godzilla.
In The Revengencers, the name of the hospital is St. Necrophagist Hospital, a reference to the German technical death metal band Necrophagist.
In Dethsources, the guys go out to a bar called "The Mastodon", a reference to the band Mastodon.

[edit] The Dethalbum
Main article: The Dethalbum
The Dethalbum was released on September 25, 2007, in both standard and deluxe editions. The album is a combination of full length tracks from the series and completely new songs. The album debuted at #21 on the Billboard 200 chart with 33,741 copies sold in its first week.[7] The Dethalbum was also streamed 45,000 times when it went live on AOL Music during the week of its release.

[edit] Endorsements
Dethklok, the in-show band, also endorses several real-world music products, including Krank Amplification, Gibson guitars, EMG pickups, David Eden Amplification, Universal Audio, M-Audio, Dunlop Manufacturing/MXR, and Line 6 gear. According to the official Dethklok MySpace, the Gibson Guitar Corporation was also planning on making a Dethklok signature guitar. During the 2008 NAMM Convention, a special edition Epiphone Explorer was unveiled to a select few. Pictures of show creator Brendon Small holding the guitar can be seen on the internet. In 2007, Shocker Toys produced a limited run of statues of William Murderface and Nathan Explosion. In 2008, Shocker Toys made a boxed set of vinyl figures with limited articulation of all 5 of the band members [8]. Kid Robot produced unarticulated figures of Murderface and Toki as part of an Adult Swim blind boxed mini figure line[9]. The song "Thunderhorse" is featured in the game Guitar Hero II by Harmonix and Red Octane as a bonus song.

[edit] Touring history
Dethklok does have a touring band, although there are no actual human counterparts to the characters on the show. The band consists of show co-creator, vocalist & guitarist Brendon Small, who writes & sings most of the music for the show, alongside drummer Gene Hoglan, bassist Bryan Beller, and second guitarist Mike Keneally. Dethklok toured with Chimaira and Soilent Green during June and early July 2008.
