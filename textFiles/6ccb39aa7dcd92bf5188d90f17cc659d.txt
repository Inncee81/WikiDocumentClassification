if (wgNotice != '') document.writeln(wgNotice); List of The Beatles songs

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The following is a table of all songs by The Beatles.

The columns Title, Year, and Album list each song title, the year in which the song was recorded, and the official UK and US studio album(s) or post break-up album on which the song first appeared.
The column Author(s) lists the writer(s) of each song. Many songs credited to "Lennon/McCartney", however, were written by Lennon or McCartney alone, or by one with only minor input from the other. Those credits are here listed as follows:




Lennon and McCartney: Songs written "eyeball to eyeball" (as Lennon once put it) (e.g. "I Want to Hold Your Hand").
Lennon, with McCartney or McCartney, with Lennon: Songs with one main composer (the first name listed), but where the other made some noteworthy contribution — for example, cases where one wrote or rewrote some of the lyrics or melody, or where one wrote the verse and the other wrote the "middle eight" or bridge section, or gives the other an unfinished song to merge with an almost complete song (e.g. "I've Got a Feeling" or "Baby, You're a Rich Man").
Lennon or McCartney: Songs that one of them wrote completely his own (e.g. "Nowhere Man" or "All My Loving").
Starkey: Ringo Starr is credited as a writer by his legal name, Richard Starkey.




The column Lead vocal(s) lists which performer(s) sang lead vocals, or "N/A" in case of instrumentals.
The columns under Chart position list the respective US and UK single chart positions where applicable.
The column Notes lists other useful information, such as the song being a cover, a B-side, etc.

There are about 300 songs on this list.
