Astrological signs represent twelve equal segments or divisions of the zodiac. According to astrology, celestial phenomena reflect or govern human activity on the principle of "as above, so below", so that the twelve signs are held to represent twelve basic personality types or characteristic modes of expression.[1]
In Western and Indian astrology, the twelve signs are associated with constellations, while in Chinese astrology there is no connection with constellations, as it is simply the line of the equator that is divided into twelve equal segments.
In Western and Asian astrology, the emphasis is on space, and the movement of the sun, moon and planets in the sky through each of the zodiac signs. In Chinese astrology, by contrast, the emphasis is on time, with the zodiac operating on cycles of years, months, and hours of the day. A common feature of all three traditions however, is the significance of the ascendant or rising sign, namely the zodiac sign that is rising (due to the rotation of the earth) on the eastern horizon at the moment of a person's birth.

[edit] Western zodiac signs
Further information: Western astrology#The twelve signs
The signs affect the energies of each planet in a characteristic way when it enters each sign (though due consideration will also be given to other conditions within the astrological chart such as the effect of aspects to other planets, and the house in which each planet falls). Each sign is associated with one of the classical elements (fire, earth, air, or water) and one of the three qualities or modalities (cardinal, fixed, or mutable). It is also associated with an area of concern: personal, social, or universal.

[edit] The twelve signs
In Western astrology the zodiac of twelve sign represents twelve types of personality. The zodiac traditionally begins with Aries. The following are the twelve zodiac signs in order.

 - Aries (The Ram) (cardinal, fire, personal): In astrology Aries is ruled by the planet Mars. The tropical duration of Aries in 2009 is 20 March

– 19 April (UTC).

 - Taurus (The Bull) (fixed, earth, personal): In astrology Taurus is ruled by the planet Venus and for a few modern astrologers, the dwarf planet Ceres. The tropical duration of Taurus in 2009 is 19 April

– 20 May (UTC).

 - Gemini (The Twins) (mutable, air, personal): In astrology Gemini is ruled by the planet Mercury. The tropical duration of Gemini in 2009 is 20 May

– 21 June (UTC).

 - Cancer (The Crab) (cardinal, water, personal): In astrology Cancer is ruled by the Moon. The tropical duration of Cancer in 2009 is 21 June

– 22 July (UTC).

 - Leo (The Lion) (fixed, fire, social): In astrology Leo is ruled by the Sun. The tropical duration of Leo in 2009 is 22 July

– 23 August (UTC).

 - Virgo (The Virgin) (mutable, earth, social): There is some debate in regards to a modern ruler of this sign with Chiron, Pallas, Vesta and Ceres often considered candidate by some modern astrologers, but the planet Mercury is typically used as the default by tradition pending a consensus among modern practitioners; but no one knows if or when this will be. The tropical duration of Virgo in 2009 is 23 August

– 22 September (UTC).

 - Libra (The Scales) (cardinal, air, social): In astrology Libra is ruled by the planet Venus. The tropical duration of Libra in 2009 is 22 September

– 23 October (UTC).

 - Scorpio (The Scorpion) (fixed, water, social): In astrology Scorpio is ruled by the planets Mars and Pluto. The tropical duration of Scorpio in 2009 is 23 October

– 22 November (UTC).

 - Sagittarius (The Archer) (mutable, fire, universal): In astrology Sagittarius is ruled by the planet Jupiter. The tropical duration of Sagittarius in 2009 is 22 November

– 21 December (UTC).

 - Capricorn (The Sea-goat) (cardinal, earth, universal): In astrology Capricorn is ruled by the planet Saturn. The tropical duration of Capricorn in 2009 is 21 December

– 20 January (UTC).

 - Aquarius (The Water Carrier) (fixed, air, universal): In astrology Aquarius is ruled by the planets Saturn and Uranus. The tropical duration of Aquarius in 2009 is 20 January

– 18 February (UTC).

 - Pisces (The Fish) (mutable, water, universal): In astrology Pisces is ruled by the planets Jupiter and Neptune. The tropical duration of Pisces in 2009 is 18 February

– 20 March (UTC).

[edit] The four elements
Main article: Triplicity

Each sign is associated one of the classical elements (water, fire, earth and air.) [3] Fire and Air signs are positive or extrovert, masculine signs; while Water and Earth signs are negative, introvert, feminine signs.

Fire Signs--Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius-- Fire represents one's desires and creative energies. [4]


Earth Signs--Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn-- Earth represents one's material resources, environment and possessions. [5]


Air Signs--Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius-- Air represents the intellect and one's ability to reason and communicate. [6]


Water Signs--Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces-- Water represents imagination, human feelings and one's ability to love and sustain. [7]

In various belief systems, four is considered an earthly number, there being four elements. Water, Air, Fire, and Earth. Three is considered a divine number, and there are three qualities: Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. Three plus four equals seven, a number often signifying the union of heaven and earth and the deliverance of our people.

[edit] The Three Qualities
The Qualities assign the Signs into Quadruplicities, three groups of four. [8] They are occasionally referred to as crosses because each quality forms a cross when drawn across the zodiac. Christian astrology relates the three qualities to the three aspects of God in the trinity.

Cardinal signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) are associated with initiation and creativity.


Fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius) are associated with focus, powerful concentration, individuality and determination.


Mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces) are associated with resourcefulness, holism and adaptability. [9]


[edit] Additional classifications





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding reliable references (ideally, using inline citations). Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2009)


While knowing the element and quality of a sign is sufficient to define it, several other groupings[citation needed] can be used for those interested in better understanding their symbolism. The most common is a sequential cycle detailed below.[citation needed] Although most commonly used to define planets, it is valid for signs as well. This cycle has been used as a metaphorical descriptor of the process of birth, development, and death, of humans, societies, or even humanity. [10]

Personal Signs - Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer - are principally aware of and concerned with the self.


Interpersonal Signs - Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio - are principally aware of and concerned with others, and sociality.


Transpersonal Signs - Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces - are principally aware of and concerned with humanity. [11]


[edit] Planetary rulerships




The symbols used in Western astrology to represent the astrological planets


In traditional Western astrology, each sign is ruled by one and only one of the seven visible planets (note that in astrology, the Sun and Moon are termed The Lights by astrologers, while the other bodies are called planets, which literally means wanderers, i.e. wandering stars as opposed to the fixed stars). The traditional rulerships are as follows: Aries (Mars), Taurus (Venus), Gemini (Mercury), Cancer (Moon), Leo (Sun), Virgo (Mercury), Libra (Venus), Scorpio (Mars), Sagittarius (Jupiter), Capricorn (Saturn), Aquarius (Uranus), Pisces (Jupiter). [12]
Many modern, psychologically-oriented astrologers believe that Uranus is the ruler or co-ruler of Aquarius instead of Saturn, Neptune is the ruler or co-ruler of Pisces instead of Jupiter, and that Pluto is the ruler or co-ruler of Scorpio instead of Mars (with other modern astrologers claiming that Pluto rules Aries and not Mars). Some other astrologers believe that the dwarf planet Ceres may be the ruler of Virgo, while other group of modern astrologers acclaim that Ceres is the ruler of Taurus instead. Traditional astrology adheres to the rulerships system listed in the paragraph above, and the debate continues between those who consider the newly discovered planets as rulers or co-rulers of certain signs and those that do not.
Alternatively, some astrologers use the former planets Pallas, Vesta, Juno and Hygiea in their delineations and rulerships, for example Vesta to Taurus and Pallas to Virgo.
Some astrologers do not even use the astrological signs at all (mostly Cosmobiologists and Uranian Astrologers/Hamburg School); therefore they do not take into account planetary rulerships and the essential dignities when interpreting an astrological chart.

[edit] Dignity and detriment, exaltation and fall
A traditional belief of astrology is the idea that the sun, moon and planets are more powerful and effective in some signs than others, because the basic nature of both is held to be in harmony. By contrast, the sun, moon and planets are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict . The most important of these categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall.

Dignity and Detriment : A planet is strengthened or dignified if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words it is said to exercise Rulership of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered "strong" (well-dignified). Seventeenth century astrologer William Lilly compared rulership to a king on his throne, with considerable dignity. If a planet is in the sign opposite that which it rules (or is dignified), it is said to be weakened or in Detriment, for example the moon in Capricorn.[13]

In traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation (see below), Triplicity , Terms or bounds, and Face or Decan , which together are known as describing a planet's Essential dignity, the quality or ability to give of one's true nature. Contemporary traditional astrologers like John Frawley or J Lee Lehman explain further on the concept of Essential Dignity.[14]

Exaltation and Fall : In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of Exaltation. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest - who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its Fall (e.g. Moon in Scorpio), and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment. The Planet in fall is passively rejected or ignored by the sign that it's in. It can be likened to a mayor of a rival city trying to make suggestions to the hosting mayor for how he should run his city: The host mayor finds it difficult to trust him and can't see how his input could have relevancy to his city. The people of the city feel the same as their ruler. The result is impasse and failure on behalf of both mayors and the city.[15]

In addition to Essential dignity, the traditional astrologer considers Accidental dignity of planets. This is placement by house in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity describes the planet's "ability to act". So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature. [16]The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of Accidental Debilities, such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.

The twelve signs of the zodiac are not given the same prominence in Indian astrology that they are in the Western tradition. Instead the emphasis is on the system of 27 (or 28) nakshatras or lunar mansions, which have been used in Indian astrology since Vedic times. The nakshatras consist of equal divisions of the moon's path along the ecliptic and function in a similar way to the signs of the zodiac in that they represent different personality types. It is considered that the position of the moon in a particular nakshatra at the time of person's birth will give a strong indication of that individual's character and of the kind of path they will follow throughout life.

Unlike the Western or Indian zodiacs, the Chinese zodiac signs are not derived from constellations, and are not assigned to sections of the ecliptic. Instead, Chinese astrological signs operate on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (also known as shichen). A particular feature of the Chinese zodiac is its operation in a sixty year cycle in combination with the five elements of Chinese astrology (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water).

In Chinese astrology the zodiac of twelve animal sign represents twelve different types of personality. The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the Rat, and there are many stories about the Origins of the Chinese Zodiac which explain why this is so.

[edit] The four trines





This section does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources (ideally, using inline citations). Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2009)


The twelve animal signs are also broken into four categories of three signs each, known as trines

The First Trine

The first trine consists of the Rat, Dragon, and Monkey. These three signs are intense and powerful individuals, capable of great good or great evil.

The Second Trine

The second trine consists of the Ox, Snake, and Rooster. These three soul mates conquer life through endurance, application, and slow accumulation of energy.

The Third Trine

The third trine consists of the Tiger, Horse, and Dog. These three signs seek one another, and are like-minded in their pursuit of humanitarian causes.

The Fourth Trine

The fourth trine consists of the Rabbit, Sheep and Pig. The quest for these three signs is the aesthetic and beautiful in life.

[edit] The five elements

The elements differ in Chinese astrology from their Western counterparts: Air is not one of the elements as defined by the Chinese. Instead, Wood and Metal are elements alongside Earth, Fire and Water. In addition, the elements also govern various aspects of one's personality, and are assigned to various other things such as directions (North, South, East and West), colours, seasons and planets. The characteristics of the five elements are as follows: [18]

Metal: The metal person is rigid and resolute in expression and intense, with strong feelings. The direction associated with Metal is West, and the season is autumn, which makes it the fixed element for the animal signs Monkey, Rooster and Dog.


Water: The water person is a good communicator and persuader, intuitive and sympathetic to others and good at conveying feelings and emotions. The direction associated with Water is North, and the season is winter, which makes it the fixed element for the animal signs Pig, Rat and Ox.


Wood: The wood person has high morals, is self confident, expansive and co-operative, with wide and varied interests. The direction associated with Wood is East, and the season is spring, which makes it the fixed element for the animal signs Tiger, Rabbit and Dragon.


Fire: The fire person has leadership qualities, and is decisive, self confident, positive and assertive. The direction associated with Fire is South, and the season is summer, which makes it the fixed element for the animal signs Snake, Horse and Sheep.


Earth: The earth person is functional, practical, solid, reliable, organized and methodical. The direction associated with Earth is the Centre. Some Chinese astrologers associate Earth with late summer.

The five elements operate together with the twelve animal signs in a sixty year calendar. The five elements appear in the calendar in both their yin and yang forms and are known as the ten heavenly stems. When trying to calculate the relevant year of the cycle in relation to the Western calendar, an easy rule to follow is that years that end in an even number are yang, those that end with an odd number are yin. The cycle proceeds as follows:

If the year ends in 0 it is Yang Metal.
If the year ends in 1 it is Yin Metal.
If the year ends in 2 it is Yang Water.
If the year ends in 3 it is Yin Water.
If the year ends in 4 it is Yang Wood.
If the year ends in 5 it is Yin Wood.
If the year ends in 6 it is Yang Fire.
If the year ends in 7 it is Yin Fire.
If the year ends in 8 it is Yang Earth.
If the year ends in 9 it is Yin Earth.
