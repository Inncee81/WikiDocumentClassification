[edit] Education
She received her B.S. in Symbolic systems and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University. Mayer was the first female engineer hired at Google and one of their first 20 employees, joining the company in early 1999.

[edit] UI & Design Work
Mayer has notable public involvement with Google Search and Gmail, and can be considered significantly responsible for the success of these UIs.
Some controversy exists regarding the perceived 'glass ceiling' and limited involvement of lower level web-designers and Google teams, beneath her.[2]
