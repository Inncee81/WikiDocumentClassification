Catachresis (from Greek κατάχρησις, "the incorrect or improper use of a word") is used to denote the (usually intentional) use of any figure of speech that flagrantly violates the norms of a language community. Compare malapropism and solecism, which are unintentional violations of the norms.
Common forms of catachresis are:

Using a word in a sense radically different from its normal sense.


"'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse" — Shakespeare, Timon of Athens


Using a word to denote something for which, without the catachresis, there is no actual name.


"a table's leg"


Using a word out of context.


"Can't you hear that? Are you blind?"


Using paradoxes or contradictions.


"Black sun"


Creating an illogical mixed metaphor.


"To take arms against a sea of troubles..." – Shakespeare, Hamlet

This, however, may be neither a catachresis nor a mixed metaphor. Hamlet is pondering the futility of action: faced with a sea of troubles, taking up a sword and shield is not going to have an effect on the incoming wave. So understood, the quotation is a straightforward metaphor, though it can be interpreted as a catachresis.



Catachresis is often used to convey extreme emotion or alienation. It is prominent in baroque literature and, more recently, in dadaist and surrealist literature.
