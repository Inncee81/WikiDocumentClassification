[edit] Design
SHOUTcast consists of a client-server model, with each component communicating via a network protocol that intermingles audio data with metadata such as song titles and the station name. It uses HTTP as a transport protocol, although multicast is another option.
SHOUTcast servers and clients are available for Palm OS, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, and Solaris. Client-only versions exist on Windows Mobile, Series 60, the iPhone, UIQ the PlayStation Portable,[1] Nintendo DS (DSOrganize) and on the Wii.
The output format is supported by multiple clients, including Nullsoft's own Winamp, Totem, VLC media player, Amarok, XMMS, Zinf, Songbird and Apple iTunes. Shoutcast servers are usually linked to by means of playlist files, which are small text files (usually with extensions .pls or .m3u) that contain the URL of the ShoutCast server. An attempt to visit that URL in a normal Web browser will usually result in a ShoutCast status page. But if a client connects and sends a GET / and nothing else, it will get the MP3 stream (which is potentially endless). Thus a rudimentary ShoutCast player can be constructed from basic Unix/Linux commands such as "echo $'GET /\n' | nc <server> <port> | madplay -"

[edit] Uses
The most common use of SHOUTcast is for creating or listening to Internet audio broadcasts. SHOUTcast makes it possible to inexpensively set up an Internet broadcasting station, so hobbyists and large radio network owners alike can use it to set up their own broadcasting network for a fraction of the cost of a traditional AM broadcasting or FM radio station.
Some traditional radio stations use SHOUTcast to extend their presence onto the Web.

[edit] History
Created in 1999, [2] SHOUTcast's streaming protocol uses metadata tags and responses that all start with ICY, which stands for "I Can Yell", the original name of the protocol. A cybersquatter registered the associated icanyell.com/.net/.org domains before Nullsoft, so Nullsoft changed the protocol's name from I Can Yell to SHOUTcast. Despite the name change, the ICY prefix persists in the protocol spec.

[edit] SHOUTcast directory and web site
A feature of SHOUTcast servers is the ability to optionally publish server information, including the current number of listeners, in a directory of stations that Nullsoft maintains on the SHOUTcast website. Site visitors can pick a station to listen to and download a playlist file for use in their own SHOUTcast-capable media player.
In September 2008, Nullsoft redesigned the SHOUTcast website[3], which had been roughly the same since 2000. As part of the redesign, the directory and services were rebranded as "SHOUTcast Radio", rather than "SHOUTcast Streaming Technology." The redesign included a fully functional option to view the site and directory with the old layout.

[edit] Popularity
Shoutcast usage has grown rapidly since its launch a decade ago. As of 2008 it is not unusual to see over 600,000 concurrent listeners during peak hours, according to Shoutcast's self-reported statistics. The maximum and minimum number of listeners fluctuates widely during a day, with roughly three times the number of listeners during peak hours compared to low usage times.
The number of servers available through Shoutcast has also grown rapidly over the years, although at a more steady rate than listeners. Shoutcast now hosts over 20,000 stations.
