Diffusion of responsibility is a social phenomenon which tends to occur in groups of people above a certain critical size when responsibility is not explicitly assigned. This mindset can be seen in the phrase "No one raindrop thinks it caused the flood".
Diffusion of responsibility can manifest itself:

in a group of people who, through action or inaction, allow events to occur which they would never allow if they were alone. Examples include groupthink and the bystander effect.
in a group of people working on a task that loses motivation because people feel less responsible and hide their lack of effort in the group (social loafing).
in hierarchical organizations, such as when underlings claim that they were just following orders and supervisors claim that they were just issuing directives and not doing the deeds.

[edit] Examples

Kitty Genovese, a New York woman, was stabbed to death near her apartment. The New York Times reported "Thirty-Eight Who Saw Murder Didn't Call the Police," blaming social apathy.
In a firing squad, one of the shooters may be randomly issued a weapon containing a blank cartridge rather than a bullet. This allows each of the members of the firing squad to believe that he did not fire a fatal shot.
In some electric chairs there are many switches, only one of which is connected. The executioners may then choose to believe that they pulled a non-functional switch.
This phenomenon also applies to much more mundane circumstances, such as cleaning and maintenance of shared space/items or unassigned work in large organizations getting neglected.


[edit] Legal uses
The latter definition of diffusion of responsibility was used as a legal defense (unsuccessfully) by many of the Nazis being tried at Nuremberg. It has been used with varying degrees of success in other situations.
