[edit] Word processors
While word processors are not ostensibly HTML editors, many of the major products are capable of exporting document layouts in HTML format. This offers the ease of use of a word processor, similar to a WYSIWYG product (see below), but has some of the same end product limitations.

AbiWord
Apple Pages (part of the iWork suite)
AppleWorks
Microsoft Word
OpenOffice.org Writer
WordPerfect


[edit] WYSIWYG editors
Further information: Comparison of HTML editors
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) code generators offer speed and ease of use.
Many of these editors do not require any knowledge of the programming languages generated by the software.
Some of these editors store pages in a proprietary format and then export them as HTML (possibly along with other formats); the user would continue to maintain the website by working with the files in the proprietary format and re-exporting them. Other, generally simpler WYSIWYG editors are designed to work directly with HTML files.
Exported files tend to be larger than hand-coded pages (those produced with a text-based HTML editor or a plain text editor).
WYSIWYG generators tend to be better than word processors at producing highly graphical and interactive pages.
Although the term WYSIWYG is often used for these editors, they are generally not truly WYSIWYG (see Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG).

[edit] WYSIWYM editors
WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) is an alternative paradigm to WYSIWYG, in which the focus is on the semantic structure of the document rather than on the presentation. These editors produce more logically structured markup than is typical of WYSIWYG editors, while retaining the advantage in ease of use over hand-coding using a text editor.
