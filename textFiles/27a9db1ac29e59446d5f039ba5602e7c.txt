A simple vehicle driving over a ramp.






A collision with many objects.


The Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) is a physics engine. Its two main components are a rigid body dynamics simulation engine and a collision detection engine. It is free software licensed both under the BSD license and the LGPL.
ODE was started in 2001 and has already been used in many applications and games, such as BloodRayne 2, Call of Juarez, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, World of Goo, X-Moto and OpenSimulator, an open source Second Life simulator.

[edit] Description
The Open Dynamics Engine is used for simulating the dynamic interactions between bodies in space. It is not tied to any particular graphics package. It supports several geometries: Box, sphere, capsule (cylinder capped with hemispheres), Trimesh (dynamic trimesh and trimesh-trimesh collisions are still incomplete), cylinder and heightmap.

[edit] Games
