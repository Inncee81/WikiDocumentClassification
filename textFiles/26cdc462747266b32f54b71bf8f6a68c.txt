[edit] History
DISC is the four quadrant behavioral model based on the work of William Moulton Marston Ph.D. (1893 - 1947) to examine the behavior of individuals in their environment or within a specific situation. (otherwise known as environment) It therefore focuses on the styles and preferences of such behavior.
The father of DISC graduated from doctoral studies at Harvard in the newly developing field of Psychology and was also a consulting psychologist, researcher, and author of five books, either solely or through joint effort. His works were showcased in Emotions of Normal People in 1928.[1] among others.
This system of dimensions of communication has been known as the universal language of behavior. Research has found that characteristics of behavior can be grouped into four major 'personality styles' and they tend to exhibit specific characteristics common to that particular style. All individuals possess all four, but what differs from one to another is the extent of each.
For most, these types are seen in shades of grey rather than black or white, and within that, there is an interplay of behaviors, otherwise known as blends. The deonotation of such blends would be starting with the primary (or stronger) type, followed by the secondary (or lesser) type, although all contribute more than just purely the strength of that 'signal'.
Having understood the differences between these blends makes it possible to integrate individual team members with less troubleshooting - i.e. Knowing where to remedy is no longer the issue, although it still takes dedication on everyone's part not to step on one another's shoes.
Having said that, there are varying degrees of compatibility, not just toward tasks but interpersonal relationships as well. However, when they are identified, energy can be donated towards refining the results.
Each of these types has its own unique value to the team, ideal environment, general characteristics, what the individual is motivated by & value to team.
DISC is also used in an assortment of areas and used by many companies, HR professionals, organisations, consultants, trainers and the list goes on, due to its host of benefits.

[edit] Method
The assessments classify four aspects of behavior by testing a person's preferences in word associations (compare with Myers-Briggs Type Indicator). DISC is an acronym for:

Dominance - relating to control, power and assertiveness
Influence - relating to social situations and communication
Steadiness (submission in Marston's time)- relating to patience, persistence, and thoughtfulness
Conscientiousness (or caution, compliance in Marston's time) - relating to structure and organization

These four dimensions can be grouped in a grid with D and I sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and C and S below representing introverted aspects. D and C then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and I and S share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the vertical dimension represents a factor of "Assertive" or "Passive", while the horizontal represents "Open" vs. "Guarded". [2]

Dominance: People who score high in the intensity of the "D" styles factor are very active in dealing with problems and challenges, while low "D" scores are people who want to do more research before committing to a decision. High "D" people are described as demanding, forceful, egocentric, strong willed, driving, determined, ambitious, aggressive, and pioneering. Low D scores describe those who are conservative, low keyed, cooperative, calculating, undemanding, cautious, mild, agreeable, modest and peaceful.
Influence: People with High "I" scores influence others through talking and activity and tend to be emotional. They are described as convincing, magnetic, political, enthusiastic, persuasive, warm, demonstrative, trusting, and optimistic. Those with Low "I" scores influence more by data and facts, and not with feelings. They are described as reflective, factual, calculating, skeptical, logical, suspicious, matter of fact, pessimistic, and critical.
Steadiness:(Submission in Marston's time): People with High "S" styles scores want a steady pace, security, and do not like sudden change. High "S" persons are calm, relaxed, patient, possessive, predictable, deliberate, stable, consistent, and tend to be unemotional and poker faced. Low "S" intensity scores are those who like change and variety. People with Low "S" scores are described as restless, demonstrative, impatient, eager, or even impulsive.
Conscientious: (Compliance in Marston's time): Persons with High "C" styles adhere to rules, regulations, and structure. They like to do quality work and do it right the first time. High "C" people are careful, cautious, exacting, neat, systematic, diplomatic, accurate, and tactful. Those with Low "C" scores challenge the rules and want independence and are described as self-willed, stubborn, opinionated, unsystematic, arbitrary, and careless with details.
