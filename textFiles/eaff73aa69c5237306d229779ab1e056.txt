From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 

Philomath (pronounced /fɨˈloʊməθ/) is a city in the U.S. state of Oregon—see Philomath, Oregon.

A philomath (pronounced /ˈfɪloʊmæθ/) is a lover of learning, from Greek philos ("beloved," "loving," as in philosophy or philanthropy) + Greek manthanein, math- ("to learn," as in polymath). It is similar to but distinguished from philosophy in that "soph," the latter suffix, specifies "wisdom" or "knowledge."
"Philomath" is not synonymous with "polymath." A philomath is a seeker of knowledge and facts, while a polymath is a possessor of knowledge in multiple fields.
The shift in meaning for "mathema" is likely a result of the rapid categorization during the time of Plato and Aristotle of their "mathemata" in terms of education: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music, which the Greeks found to create a "natural grouping" of mathematical (in our modern usage; "doctrina mathematica" for theirs) precepts.
Additional terms: philomathy (fil-O-math-ee), the practice of a love of learning or letters.
