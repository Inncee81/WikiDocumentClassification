inner product
〈u,v〉 means the inner product of u and v, where u and v are members of an inner product space.

Note that the notation 〈u, v〉 may be ambiguous: it could mean the inner product or the linear span.

There are many variants of the notation, such as 〈u | v〉 and (u | v), which are described below. The less-than and greater-than symbols are primarily from computer science; they are avoided in mathematical texts. For spatial vectors, the dot product notation, x·y is common. For matrices, the colon notation A : B may be used.
The standard inner product between two vectors x = (2, 3) and y = (−1, 5) is:
〈x, y〉 = 2 × −1 + 3 × 5 = 13

∮


contour integral or closed line integral
Similar to the integral, but used to denote a single integration over a closed curve or loop. It is sometimes used in physics texts involving equations regarding Gauss's Law, and while these formulas involve a closed surface integral, the representations describe only the first integration of the volume over the enclosing surface. Instances where the latter requires simultaneous double integration, the symbol ∯ would be more appropriate. A third related symbol is the closed volume integral, denoted by the symbol ∰.
The contour integral can also frequently be found with a subscript capital letter C, ∮C, denoting that a closed loop integral is, in fact, around a contour C, or sometimes dually appropriately, a circle C. In representations of Gauss's Law, a subscript capital S, ∮S, is used to denote that the integration is over a closed surface.

If C is a Jordan curve about 0, then .

[edit] Advanced and less-frequently used math symbols
Here are some other math symbols in a compact list, preceded by their Unicode values

x2135: ℵ: Hebrew letter aleph, the sign for cardinality


x2210 ∐: direct sum, but in other areas of math, it might mean the coproduct


x22c9 ⋉: semidirect product


[edit] Note on symbol names
One symbol can have up to four different names in standard web publishing. For example, the Unicode symbol known as "Subset of or equal to" can be expressed as:

Unicode: &#x2286; rendered as ⊆ or as the raw Unicode character ⊆ in the wikitext
HTML: &sube; rendered as ⊆
TeX (LaTex, MathML): \subseteq rendered as 
Postscript (Adobe, PDF) name: reflexsubset. The Postscript name is of interest if you are viewing a raw PDF 1.3 or earlier version files or other low-level issue. See Symbol (typeface) is some Postscript names that one will find if one examines PDF files. (see PostScript Language Reference Manual, pp. 256-257, "Symbol Font").

Some useful cross-references via Unicode are:

[edit] Abbreviated function names
There are a typical set of abbreviations used for functions whose names.
Operators borrowed from linear algebra include:

char = characteristic
det = determinant
dim = dimension (vector space)
Card = cardinality (AKA order)

and from category theory:

Ker = kernel (category theory)
Im = Image (mathematics)
Tr or trace = field trace

and from other areas of abstract algebra:

= , → See Exact functor, Topological half-exact functor
δ = Delta functor
End = Endomorphism ring
Ext = Ext functor (extension of modules)
Frob = Frobenius endomorphism
Hom = Hom functor
Spec = spectrum of a ring
Sym = symmetric group
Sym2 = symmetric square
Tan = tangent space
Tor = Tor functor (torsion)


general and special linear groups are referred to with the acronyms SL, GL, PSL and PGL.
