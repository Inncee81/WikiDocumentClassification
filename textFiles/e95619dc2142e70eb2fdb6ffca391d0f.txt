Bradley Joseph "Brad" Fitzpatrick (born February 5, 1980 in Iowa), often seen on the Internet under the nickname bradfitz, is an American programmer. He is best known as the creator of LiveJournal and is the author of a variety of free software projects such as memcached, notably used on LiveJournal,[1] Facebook[2][3] and YouTube.[4]
Born in Iowa, Fitzpatrick grew up in Beaverton, Oregon and majored in computer science at the University of Washington in Seattle.
LiveJournal eventually became a full-time job and then a company, which he called Danga Interactive. In January 2005, Fitzpatrick sold Danga to Six Apart, for an undisclosed sum of cash and stock.[5] He was named chief architect of Six Apart.[6] He left Six Apart in August 2007, citing a need to move on to different projects, and had not been active in LiveJournal's development for about two years,[7] but joined the LiveJournal Advisory Board in 2008.[8] He now works for Google.[9][10][11]
Brad is an avid scuba diver and motorcyclist.

[edit] Free Software
Some noteworthy free software projects by Fitzpatrick:

memcached, a memory caching system designed to ease database load on large webserving applications, and used in many other situations as well;
Perlbal, a load balancer and reverse proxy;
MogileFS, a distributed file system;
djabberd, a Jabber server;
PicPix, a photo-hosting service.
Brackup, a flexible backup tool.

Since many of these applications were motivated by the real-world needs of LiveJournal, they are often useful for other database-driven websites, and have been used with several other websites and applications.[12]
Before LiveJournal, Fitzpatrick created FreeVote, a site hosting web-based voting booths. More recently, he created the OpenID single sign-on mechanism.[13]
