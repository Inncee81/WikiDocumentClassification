‎
The history of Trinidad and Tobago begins with the settlements of the islands by Amerindians. Both islands were encountered by Christopher Columbus on his third voyage in 1498. Tobago changed hands between the British, French, Dutch and Courlanders, but eventually ended up in British hands. Trinidad remained in Spanish hands until 1797, but it was largely settled by French colonists. In 1888 the two islands were incorporated into a single crown colony. Trinidad and Tobago obtained self-governance in 1958 and independence from the British Empire in 1962. It became a republic in 1976.[1]

[edit] Contemporary Trinidad
Main article: Trinidad and Tobago
Today Trinidad is the result of a fusion of many different cultures. It hosts an annual pre-Lenten Carnival. It is the birthplace of Calypso music, the Steelpan musical instrument and Limbo dance. Styles of popular music include Calypso, Chutney music, Soca and Parang.
Major landforms include the hills of the Northern, Central and Southern Ranges(Dinah ranges), the Caroni, Nariva and Oropouche Swamps, and the Caroni and Naparima Plains. Major river systems include the Caroni, North and South Oropouche and Ortoire Rivers. Native mammals include the Red Brocket Deer, Collared Peccary, Red Howler Monkey and the Ocelot. Trinidad has a rich avifauna, including a single endemic species, the Trinidad Piping Guan.
Trinidad is the second richest country in the Caribbean. It is an industrial island with a diversified economy, based to a large extent on oil and natural gas, industry and agriculture.[citation needed] It is one of the leading gas-based export centers in the world, being the leading exporter of ammonia and methanol and among the top five exporters of liquefied natural gas. This has allowed Trinidad to capitalize on the large mineral reserves within its territories.
