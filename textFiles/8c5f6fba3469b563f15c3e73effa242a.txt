From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 



The following is a list of ethnic slurs (ethnophaulisms) that are, or have been, used as insinuations or allegations about members of a given ethnicity or to refer to them in a derogatory (critical or disrespectful), pejorative (disapproving or contemptuous), or insulting manner in the English-speaking world. For the purposes of this list, an ethnic slur is a term or word[s] used to insult on the basis of race, ethnicity, or nationality. Each term is listed followed by its country or region of usage, a definition, and a reference to that term (unless a well-referenced Wikipedia article exists).
Ethnic slurs may also be produced by combining a general-purpose insult with the name of ethnicity, such as "dirty Arab", "dirty Jew", "Russian pig", etc. Other common insulting modifiers include "dog", "filthy", etc. Such terms are not included in this list.
Related are the immigration slurs: while not necessarily targeting a particular ethnicity or race, they point at a "non-native" descent of the person.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z





A

Abbie / Abe / Abie 
(North America) a Jewish male. From the proper name Abraham. Originated before the 1950s.[1]
ABCD 
(Subcontinentals in U.S.) "American-Born Confused Desi", used to imply that an American-born South Asian (Usually Pakistani and Indian, but increasingly Bangladeshi) is confused about their cultural identity. ABCD is the most common version of the phrase, but there are variations of it that extend all the way to the letter 'z' in at least two different versions: "American Born Confused Desi, Emigrated From Gujarat, House in Jersey, Kids Learning Medicine, Now Owning Property, Quite Reasonable Salary, Two Uncles Visiting, White Xenophobia Yet Zestful" and "American Born Confused Desi, Emigrated From Gujarat, Housed In Jersey, Keeping Lotsa Motels, Named Omkarnath Patel, Quickly Reached Success Through Underhanded Vicious Ways, Xenophobic Yet Zestful"[2]
Abo / Abbo 
(AUS) Australian Aboriginal person. Originally, this was simply an informal term for "Aborigine", and was in fact used by Aboriginal people themselves until it started to be considered offensive in 1950s. In remoter areas, Aboriginal people still often refer to themselves (quite neutrally) as "Blackfellas" (and whites as "Whitefellas"). Although "Abo" is still considered quite offensive by many, the pejorative "boong" is now more commonly used when the intent is to deliberately offend, as that word's status as an insult is unequivocal.[3]
Albino 
(U.S.) A term for whites, also a derogatory term for light skinned blacks used by darker skinned blacks.[4] (see colorism)
Alligator bait 
(U.S.) also "Gator Bait." A black person, especially a black child. More commonly used in states where alligators are found — particularly Florida. First used in the early 1900s, although some hypothesize the term originated in the late 1800s.[5]
Alter kacker / alter kocker (Yiddish) / alter kucker / A.K. 
(North America) a disparaging term for elderly Jewish people. The term is of Yiddish origin (literally meaning old shitter). First used in the early 1900s.[6]
Anglo-pilferer
An Anglo-Celtic Australian, possibly of convict lineage. Based on the belief that all Anglo-Australians are descended from convicts. Particularly offensive.[7]
Ann 
(North America) A white woman to a black person — or a black woman who acts too much like a white one. While Miss Ann, also just plain Ann, is a derisive reference to the white woman, by extension it is applied to any black woman who puts on airs and tries to act like Miss Ann.[8]
Ape 
(U.S.) a black person.[9]
Apple 
(North America) An American Indian (Native American) who is "red on the outside, white on the inside." Used primarily by other American Indians to indicate someone who has lost touch with their cultural identity. First used in the 1980s.[10]
Argie 
(UK) a native of Argentina (also Argie-bargie : any argument, disagreement, or (typically) sporting event involving Argentina or Argentinians), used by the British press during the Falklands War. Coined by Britain's The Sun newspaper in 1982.[11]
Aunt Jemima / Aunt Jane / Aunt Mary / Aunt Sally / Aunt Thomasina 
(U.S.) a black woman who "kisses up" to whites, a "sellout", female counterpart of Uncle Tom.[12]


B

Beaner
(U.S.) term widely regarded as derogatory, that refers to people of Mexican descent or, more broadly, mestizos.[13][14][15] The term originates from the prevalence of frijoles pintos and other beans in Mexican food.[15][16]
Boche; bosche; bosch 
(France; U.S.; UK) a German [shortened from French alboche, a combination of French caboche (head) and allemand (German)].[17]

(North America) a person of east-central European descent. Originally referred to those of Bohemian (now Czech Republic) descent. Was commonly used toward Ukrainian immigrants during the early 20th century.[20]
Boong / bong / bung
(Aus) Australian aboriginal.[21] Related to the Australian English slang word bung, meaning "dead", "infected", "dysfunctional". From bung, to go bung "Originally to die, then to break down, go bankrupt, cease to function [Ab. bong dead]".[22] Highly offensive. [First used in 1847 by JD Lang, Cooksland, 430][23]
Boonga / boong / bunga / boonie 
(New Zealand) a Pacific Islander [alteration of boong].[24]
Bounty Bar 
A Bounty chocolate bar, being composed of coconut coated with chocolate, is white on the inside and brown on the outside. As with wigger, this is a both a subcultural and ethnic slur. The immediate target is denigrated for having the cultural values of a different ethnic group, with the implication that that ethnic group is bad or inferior. Coconut and Oreo are used in the same way.[25]
Brownie 
(U.S.) a. a person of mixed white and black ancestry; a mulatto. b. (U.S.) a young, brown-skinned person 1940s-1950s[26]

(North America) a mildly derogatory term used by African Americans, mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, to refer to a white person (from James Baldwin's novel, Blues For Mr. Charlie).

Chee-chee 
a Eurasian half-caste [probably from Hindi chi-chi fie!, literally, dirt][30]
Chinaman 
(Worldwide English) Chinese person, used in old American west when discrimination against Chinese was common.[31] The term generates controversy when still used in geographic places associated or resembling Chinese. Though it is still heard in the lyrics to the 70s song "Kung Fu Fighting" and Fast and furious movie song "Tokyo Drift" by teriyaki boys, it tends to generate objections in modern times, especially in the US where Asian-American is the preferred nomenclature. (Note that in cricket, the term "chinaman" is used in a non-ethnic sense to refer to a left-handed bowler who uses a wrist spin action.)
Cheese-eating surrender monkey 
(UK, US, Canada) A Frenchman, from the perceived proclivity of the French to surrender in military confrontations and the huge variety of French cheeses available[32].

Coon 
(U.S. and U.K) a black person. Possibly from Portuguese barraco, a building constructed to hold slaves for sale (1837).[43][44] Popularized by the song "Zip Coon", played at Minstrel shows in the 1830s.

Dhoti
In Nepal the word Dhoti is often used as an ethnic slur against the Madhesi community of Nepal and Indians by the majority population of Nepal. This may be because of the popularity of dhotis in the terai region and the bordering Indian states.[52]
Dink
an Asian, esp. a Vietnamese. Also used as a disparaging term for a North Vietnamese soldier or guerrilla in the Vietnam War. Origin: 1965–70, Americanism; cf. Australian slang dink Chinese person; perh. back formation from dinky, reinforced by rhyme with Chink[53]

E

Eight ball 
A Negro; slang, usually used disparagingly[58]


Eskimo 
A native North American from the northernmost inhabitable areas. Its status as a pejorative term varies by location:

In Canada and Greenland, "Eskimo" is considered offensive, partly because of the now-discredited perception that the word meant "eater of raw meat" in the Cree native language; see origin of the name Eskimo. In Canada, "Inuinnaq" is the preferred term in the central Arctic and "Inuit" in the eastern Arctic, though "Inuit" is acceptable throughout Arctic Canada. In Greenland, the preferred terms are "Kallaalit" in their own language and "Greenlanders" in English. Similar to Nigger the term was likely not originally racist, however it is now considered unacceptable in those regions.[59]
In Alaska, "Eskimo" is not considered offensive, and is widely used even among the state's Arctic peoples. Although the term "Inuit" describes all the indigenous Arctic peoples of Canada and Greenland, this is not the case in Alaska or Siberia. The Arctic peoples of Alaska are divided linguistically and ethnically into Inuit and Yupik. The term "Inuit" is not generally accepted by either group in Alaska, even the state's Inuit themselves (who prefer "Inupiat"), and "Eskimo" is the accepted collective term when referring to both Inuit and Yupik.




Eyetie

Frog 
(Canada UK US) A French person. Prior to 1800's, referred to the Dutch (as they were stereotyped as being marsh-dwellers). When France became Britain's main enemy, replacing the Dutch, the epithet transferred to them,[65][66] due to the French recipe for eating frogs' legs (see comparable French term Rosbif). Also used in Canada to refer to both the French and French Canadians, and occasionally incorrectly as more broadly to people from Quebec who are not, in fact, necessarily French or French speaking.[67]

Greaseball, Greaser
(US) a person of Italian descent. Or rarely, a person of Hispanic descent.[77]
Gringo
(Hispanic Americans, Brazil) a white person or foreigner. The term lends itself to derogatory or paternalistic connotations, but depending on the context it may not be meant pejoratively. Gringo may be derived from several origins. One is the Spanish word for "Greek" (griego), applied to foreigner. Another is "Green, go home," from the color of US money in Latin America. Yet another derives from the singing by US troops of the song of celtic origin, "Green Grow the Rushes". In Brazil, "gringo" is applied to any foreigners (including Mexicans or Argentines) and has no negative connotations by itself.[78]

In contemporary Hawaii, the term Haole can be used descriptively to mean Caucasians in terms of race, or can be used negatively or as a racial epithet, though some people take it to always be insulting, it has various meanings depending upon use context.
Hapa 
(US, Hawaiian) Of mixed Asian race. Like with the slur "nigger" Asians of mixed ancestry are using this word to destigmatize the term.[87] It still can be regarded as a racial slur, as being called colored. In modern Hawaii, the term is common and merely descriptive of people of mixed race, namely part Hawaiian and part non-Hawaiian. There is also a popular band named Hapa which has two musicians, one caucasian and one mixed race Hawaiian, which performs modern and traditional Hawaiian music.
