[edit] Millennium Prize Problems
Of the seven Millennium Prize Problems set by the Clay Mathematics Institute, the six ones yet to be solved are:

P versus NP
The Hodge conjecture
The Riemann hypothesis
Yang–Mills existence and mass gap
Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness
The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture

Only the Poincaré conjecture has been solved. The smooth four dimensional Poincaré conjecture is still unsolved. That is, can a four dimensional topological sphere have two or more inequivalent smooth structures?

[edit] Other still-unsolved problems

[edit] Additive number theory

Goldbach's conjecture and its weak version
The values of g(k) and G(k) in Waring's problem
Collatz conjecture (3n + 1 conjecture)
Gilbreath's conjecture


[edit] Number theory: prime numbers

Catalan's Mersenne conjecture
Twin prime conjecture
Are there infinitely many prime quadruplets?
Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes (Lenstra-Pomerance-Wagstaff conjecture); equivalently, infinitely many even perfect numbers?
Are there infinitely many regular primes, is their density ?
Are there infinitely many Cullen primes?
Are there infinitely many palindromic primes in base 10?
Are there infinitely many Fibonacci primes?
Is every Fermat number composite for n > 4?
Is 78,557 the lowest Sierpinski number?
Is 509,203 the lowest Riesel number?
Fortune's conjecture (that no Fortunate number is composite)
Polignac's conjecture
Landau's problems


[edit] General number theory

abc conjecture
Do any odd perfect numbers exist?
Do quasiperfect numbers exist?
Do any odd weird numbers exist?
Do any Lychrel numbers exist?
Is 10 a solitary number?
Do any Taxicab(5, 2, n) exist for n>1?
Brocard's problem: existence of integers, n,m, such that n!+1=m2 other than n=4,5,7


[edit] Discrete geometry

Solving the Happy Ending problem for arbitrary n
Finding matching upper and lower bounds for K-sets and halving lines
The Hirsch conjecture on the lengths of shortest paths in the vertices and edges of a convex polytope
The Hadwiger conjecture on covering n-dimensional convex bodies with at most 2n smaller copies


[edit] Ramsey theory

The values of the Ramsey numbers, particularly R(5,5)
The values of the Van der Waerden numbers


[edit] General algebra

Hilbert's sixteenth problem
Hadamard conjecture
existence of perfect cuboids
Existence of quadratic number fields being Euclidean but not norm-Euclidean


[edit] Combinatorics

Number of Magic squares (sequence A006052 in OEIS)
Finding a formula for the probability that two elements chosen at random generate the symmetric group Sn
Frankl's union-closed sets conjecture: for any family of sets closed under sums there exists an element (of the underlying space) belonging to half or more of the sets
The Lonely runner conjecture: if k runners with pairwise distinct speeds run round a track of unit length, will every runner be "lonely" (that is, be more than a distance 1 / (k + 1) from each other runner) at some time?


[edit] Graph theory

The Erdős-Gyárfás conjecture on cycles with power-of-two lengths in cubic graphs

Deriving a closed-form expression for the percolation threshold values, especially pc (square site)
Tutte's conjectures that every bridgeless graph has a nowhere-zero 5-flow and every bridgeless graph without the Petersen graph as a minor has a nowhere-zero 4-flow
The Reconstruction conjecture and New digraph reconstruction conjecture concerning whether or not a graph is recognizable by the vertex deleted subgraphs.
The cycle double cover conjecture that every bridgeless graph has a family of cycles that includes each edge twice.


[edit] Analysis

Schanuel's conjecture
Lehmer's conjecture
Pompeiu problem
Is γ (the Euler-Mascheroni constant) irrational?


[edit] Group theory
