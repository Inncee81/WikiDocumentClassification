[edit] Programmes
PPLive programmes are targeted to Chinese audiences. A majority of them are categorized as movie, music, TV series or live TV streaming. Also available are some specialties covering sports, news, game shows, etc. Most available programs are in Mandarin, Cantonese or Korean. There are also increasing amount of programs in English, such as Hollywood blockbuster movies and popular American TV shows. All these English-speaking shows are hard-coded with Chinese subtitles.

[edit] Compatibility
The PPLive program is installable on Asian and English language versions of Windows 2000 and Windows XP.
By default, it uses Windows Media Player and RealPlayer. The media player that is opened depends on the type of stream.

[edit] Known problems and limitations
Since PPLive video stream depends on the network connection and peer numbers, the occasional glitch such as the short pause during the viewing or re-buffer is not unusual. In some circumstances, the stream could stop completely if source video file crashes or not enough peers available to establish a smooth streaming.
