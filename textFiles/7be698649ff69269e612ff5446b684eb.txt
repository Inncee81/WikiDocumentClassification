ActiveSync is a data synchronization program developed by Microsoft for use with its Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Originally released under the name "Handheld PC Explorer" in 1996, it provides users of Microsoft Windows a way to transport documents, calendars, contact lists and email between their desktop computer and a mobile device, such as a Handheld PC, mobile phone, or any other portable devices that support the ActiveSync protocol. ActiveSync is available as a free download from Microsoft's web site.
Activesync uses ActiveSync Exchange, a proprietary protocol, requiring other vendors to license the protocol to achieve compatibility.[1]
ActiveSync also refers to a push messaging component first included with Microsoft Exchange Server 2003.

[edit] Desktop ActiveSync
The desktop ActiveSync program allows a mobile device to be synchronized with either a desktop PC, or a server running Microsoft Exchange Server, PostPath Email and Collaboration Server, Critical Path Messaging Server, Kerio MailServer, Scalix, Zimbra or Z-push. Only Personal information manager (PIM) data (Email/Calendar/Contacts) may be synchronized with the Exchange Server. (Tasks may also be synchronised with Exchange Server on Windows Mobile 5.0 devices.) The PC synchronization option, however, allows PIM synchronization with Microsoft Outlook, along with Internet "favorites", files, and tasks, amongst other data types. Unfortunately ActiveSync doesn't support all features of Outlook. For instance contacts grouped into subfolders aren't transferred. Only the contacts which are not in a subfolder are synchronized.
ActiveSync also provides for the manual transfer of files to a mobile device, along with limited backup/restore functionality, and the ability to install and uninstall mobile device applications.
Supported mobile devices include PDAs or Smartphones running Windows Mobile, or the Windows CE operating system, along with devices that don't use a Microsoft operating system,[2] such as the Palm OS and Symbian platforms, as well as Apple Inc.'s iPhone.
Starting with Windows Vista, ActiveSync has been replaced with the Windows Mobile Device Center, which is included as part of the operating system.[3]

[edit] Exchange Server ActiveSync
In addition to the ActiveSync desktop sync software bundled with Windows, Microsoft also uses the ActiveSync name to refer to the push messaging component of Exchange Server, which relays messages to mobile devices.
