Occupation
President of MySpace


Website

Thomas "Tom" Anderson (age disputed) is the President of the social networking website MySpace.
Anderson is one of the people identified as a founder of the MySpace site, along with CEO Chris DeWolfe. Since newly created MySpace accounts include Tom as a default "friend," he has become known as the face of MySpace. As of 2009, Tom has more than 250 million friends.
Anderson earned a Bachelor of Arts in Rhetoric and English from the University of California, Berkeley and a Master's Degree in film—critical studies from the University of California, Los Angeles.[citation needed]
In 2003, working for eUniverse under the purview of Brad Greenspan, he and a few other eUniverse employees set up the first pages of MySpace, and the site grew from there.[citation needed] It is currently one of the most popular social networking websites in the United States (listing consistently among the top ten on Alexa Top 500 Global Sites, after it's main competitor, Facebook.)[1]

[edit] Age dispute and teen life
As of 2007, Tom Anderson claimed he was born on November 8, 1975.[2] In 2008, reports indicated he was 5 years older.[3]
According to several sources, in 1985 then-14-year-old San Pasqual High School (Escondido, California) student Tom Anderson was a computer hacker operating under the alias Lord Flathead. He was known for leading a team that broke into Chase Manhattan Bank computers, altered records and left a message saying that unless he was given free use of the system he would destroy records. He was never charged.[3][4][5][6]

[edit] Role in founding
Main article: MySpace#Controversy over corporate history
The corporate history of MySpace has been a matter of some public dispute. When MySpace was purchased by News Corp. they also gained control of the editor's account (the Tom Anderson profile) from which all service announcements are made. Such announcements are not from "Tom Anderson" personally but from the corporate owned identity. It has even been claimed that Tom Anderson's role and image as MySpace founder and "first friend" is a public relations invention.[7]
Another aspect of MySpace's origins that turned out to be misrepresented was Anderson's age. Supposedly 27 when the site was first created, the age stated on his profile followed this information, adding a year with each birthday. It was subsequently revealed that Anderson was five years older than his profile claimed. Speculation on the reasons focused on the benefits in reaching the youth market, by positioning the founders as hip young entrepreneurs instead of "30-somethings."[8]
