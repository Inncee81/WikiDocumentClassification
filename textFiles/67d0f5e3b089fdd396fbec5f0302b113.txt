From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

TRON is an open real-time operating system kernel design, and is an acronym for "The Real-time Operating system Nucleus". The project was started by Prof. Dr. Ken Sakamura of the University of Tokyo in 1984. The project's goal is to create an ideal computer architecture and network, to provide for all of society's needs.[citation needed]
As of 2003, the TRON system (or more specifically the ITRON derivative) is one of the world's most used operating systems[1], being present in millions of electronic devices. The operating system is mainly used by Japanese companies, although interest in its use is growing worldwide.[citation needed] However it has been said that there is much misinformation in the English speaking world about TRON due to the majority of the documentation being in Japanese[2].

[edit] The TRON architecture
TRON itself does not specify the source code for the kernel, but instead is a "set of interfaces and design guidelines"[3] for creating the kernel. This allows different companies to create their own versions of TRON, based on the specifications, which can be suited for different microprocessors.
While the specification of TRON is publicly available, implementations can be proprietary at the discretion of the implementor.

[edit] Sub-architectures
The TRON framework defines a complete architecture for the different computing units:

ITRON (Industrial TRON): an architecture for real-time operating systems for embedded systems; this is the most popular use of the TRON architecture

JTRON: a sub-project of ITRON to allow it to use the Java platform


BTRON (Business TRON): for personal computers, workstations, PDAs, mainly as the human-machine interface in networks based on the TRON architecture
CTRON (Central and Communications TRON): for mainframe computers, digital switching equipment
MTRON (Macro TRON): for intercommunication between the different TRON components.


[edit] History
In 1984 the TRON Project was officially launched. A year later, in 1985, NEC announced the first ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/86 specification. In 1986 the TRON Kyogikai (unincorporated TRON Association) was established, Hitachi announced its ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/68K specification, and the first TRON project symposium is held. In 1987 Fujitsu announced an ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/MMU specification, Mitsubishi Electric announced an ITRON implementation based on the ITRON/32 specification, and Hitachi introduced the Gmicro/200 32bit microprocessor[4] based on the TRON VLSI CPU specification. In 2004, the mayor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara mentioned "TRON was once killed by the former Minister of International Trade and Industry, Hashimoto, because he was at that time under the pressure of United States."

[edit] Administration
The administration of the TRON Project, in its role to define TRON (the name of the specification itself), is by the TRON Association.
