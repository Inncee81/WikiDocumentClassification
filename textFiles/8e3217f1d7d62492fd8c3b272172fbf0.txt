Needle Tower by Kenneth Snelson (1968)


Tensegrity is a portmanteau of tensional integrity. It refers to structures with an integrity based on a synergy between balanced tension and compression components.
The term "synergetics" may refer more abstractly to synergetic systems of contrasting forces.

[edit] Concept




The Skylon tower at the Festival of Britain, 1951






The simplest tensegrity structure. Each of three compression members is symmetric with the other three and end to end. Each end is connected to three cables which provide compression and which precisely define the position of that end in the same way as the three cables in the Skylon tower define the bottom end of that pillar.






A similar structure but with four compression members.


Tensegrity structures are structures based on the combination of a few simple but subtle and deep design patterns:

loading members only in pure compression or pure tension, meaning the structure will only fail if the cables yield or the rods buckle (the rods would have to be an exceptionally weak material with a very large diameter to yield before they buckle or the cables yield)
preload, which allows cables to be rigid in compression
minimal overconstraint which reduces stress localization
mechanical stability, which allows the members to remain in tension/compression as stress on the structure increases

Because of these patterns, no members experience a bending moment. This produces exceptionally rigid structures for their mass and for their cross section.
A conceptual building block of tensegrity is seen in the 1951 Skylon tower. The long tower is held in place at one end by only three cables. At the bottom end, exactly three cables are needed to fully determine the position of the bottom end of the spire so long as the spire is loaded in compression. Two cables would be unstable, like a person on a slackrope; one cable is just the limit case of two cables when the two cables are anchored in the same place.
A simple three-rod tensegrity structure (shown) builds on this: locally, each end of each rod looks like the bottom of the Skylon tower. As long as the angle between any two cables is smaller than 180° as seen looking along the rod, the position of the rod is well defined. What may not be immediately obvious is that because this is true for all six rod ends, the structure as a whole is stable. Variations such as Needle Tower involve more than three cables meeting at the end of a rod, but these can be thought of as three cables defining the position of that rod end with the additional cables simply attached to that well-defined point in space.

[edit] Applications
The idea was adopted into architecture in the 1980s when David Geiger designed the first significant structure - Seoul Olympic Gymnastics Arena for the 1988 Summer Olympics. The Georgia Dome, which was used for the 1996 Summer Olympics is a large tensegrity structure of similar design to the aforementioned Gymnastics Hall.
Theoretically, there is no limitation to the size of a tensegrity. Cities could be covered with geodesic domes. Planets and stars (Dyson sphere) could be contained within them.

"Tensegrity is a contraction of tensional integrity structuring. All geodesic domes are tensegrity structures, whether the tension-islanded compression differentiations are visible to the observer or not. Tensegrity geodesic spheres do what they do because they have the properties of hydraulically or pneumatically inflated structures."

As Harvard physician and scientist Donald Ingber explains:

"The tension-bearing members in these structures – whether Fuller's domes or Snelson's sculptures – map out the shortest paths between adjacent members (and are therefore, by definition, arranged geodesically) Tensional forces naturally transmit themselves over the shortest distance between two points, so the members of a tensegrity structure are precisely positioned to best withstand stress. For this reason, tensegrity structures offer a maximum amount of strength."

In 2009, the Kurilpa Bridge will open across the Brisbane River in Queensland, Australia. The new greenbridge will be a multiple-mast, cable-stay structure based on the principles of tensegrity.

[edit] Biology
The concept has applications in biology. Biological structures such as muscles and bones, or rigid and elastic cell membranes, are made strong by the unison of tensioned and compressed parts. The muscular-skeletal system is a synergy of muscle and bone, the muscle provides continuous pull, the bones discontinuous push. Tensegrity has been theorized by Rick Barrett to have implications in Taijiquan and athletics in general. He claims that high level athletes and Taijiquan players enter into "the zone", and have access to the tensegrity of their connective tissue system. This would explain greater levels of integration, strength, and faster reactions in elite athletes.

[edit] History
In 1948, artist Kenneth Snelson produced his innovative 'X-Piece' after artistic explorations at Black Mountain College (where Buckminster Fuller was lecturing) and elsewhere. Some years later, the term 'tensegrity' was coined by Fuller, who is best known for his geodesic domes. Throughout his career, Fuller had experimented incorporating tensile components in his work, such as in the framing of his dymaxion houses.[1] Snelson's 1948 innovation spurred Fuller to immediately commission a mast from Snelson. In 1949, Fuller developed an icosahedron based on the technology, and he and his students quickly developed further structures and applied the technology to building domes. After a hiatus, Snelson also went on to produce a plethora of sculptures based on tensegrity concepts. Snelson's main body of work began in 1959 when a pivotal exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art took place. At the MOMA exhibition, Fuller had shown the mast and some of his other work.[2] At this exhibition, Snelson also had displayed some work in a vitrine.[3] Snelson's best known piece is his 18-meter-high Needle Tower of 1968.
Russian artist Viatcheslav Koleichuk claimed that the idea of tensegrity was invented first by Karl Ioganson, Russian artist of Latvian descent, who contributed some works based on this principle to the main exhibition of Russian constructivism in 1921.[4] This claim was backed by Maria Gough in a paper.[5] Kenneth Snelson however denied this claim insisting that Ioganson's works were much further than one step from his own concept of tensegrity,[6] but he has acknowledged the constructivists as an influence for his work. French engineer David Georges Emmerich has also noted how Ioganson's work seemed to foresee tensegrity concepts.[7]
