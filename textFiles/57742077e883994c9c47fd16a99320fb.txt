Bazaar (formerly Bazaar-NG, commandline tool bzr) is a distributed revision control system sponsored by Canonical Ltd., designed to make it easier for anyone to contribute to free and open source software projects.
The development team's focus is on ease of use, accuracy and flexibility, with a particular focus on branching and merging[citation needed]. Bazaar can be used by a single developer working on multiple branches of local content, or by teams collaborating across a network.
Bazaar is written in the Python programming language, with packages for major Linux distributions, Mac OS X and MS Windows. Bazaar is free software and part of the GNU project.[1][2]

[edit] Features
Bazaar commands are quite similar to those found in CVS or SVN, and a new project can be started and maintained without a remote repository server by invoking the bzr init command in a directory which a person wishes to version.[3]
In contrast to purely distributed version control systems which don't use a central server, Bazaar supports working with or without a central server. It is possible to use both methods at the same time with the same project. The websites Launchpad and Sourceforge provide free hosting service for projects managed with Bazaar.
Bazaar has support for working with some other revision control systems.[4] This allows users to branch from another system (such as Subversion), make local changes and commit them into a Bazaar branch, and then later merge them back into the other system. Bazaar has basic support for Subversion with the bzr-svn plugin.[5] There is also beginnings of support for both Mercurial[6] and Git.[7] Currently these are not feature complete, but are complete enough to show a graphical history.
Bazaar supports files with names from the complete Unicode set. It also allows commit messages, committer names, etc. to be in Unicode.

[edit] Plugins

BzrTools - utilities collection
bzr-svn - Subversion format support
bzr-rebase
QBzr
bzr-keywords

The Windows installer includes BzrTools, bzr-svn, QBzr and TortoiseBZR by default.

[edit] Users
Prominent projects that use Bazaar for version control include: GNU Mailman[8][9], MySQL[10], Gnash, Squid, GNUpdf and the GNOME bindings for Java[8][11]

[edit] History

[edit] Baz: an earlier Canonical Ltd version control system
The name "Bazaar" was originally used by a fork of the GNU arch client tla. This fork is now[update] called Baz to distinguish it from the current Bazaar software.[12] Baz was announced in October 2004 by Canonical Ltd employee Robert Collins[13] and maintained until 2005, when the project then called Bazaar-NG (the present Bazaar) was announced as Baz's successor.[14] Baz is now unmaintained and Canonical considers it deprecated.[15][16] The last release of Baz was version 1.4.3, released October 2005.[17] A planned 1.5 release of Baz was abandoned in 2006.[18]

[edit] Bazaar
In February 2005, Martin Pool, a developer who had previously described and reviewed a number of revision control systems in talks and in his weblog, announced that he had been hired by Canonical Ltd. and tasked with "build[ing] a distributed version-control system that open-source hackers will love to use."[19] A public website and mailing list were established in March 2005 and the first numbered pre-release, 0.0.1, was released on March 26 2005.[20][21][22]
Bazaar was conceived from the start as a different piece of software from both GNU arch and Baz. It has a different command set and is a completely different codebase and design. It was designed to build on the best ideas from a variety of other open source revision control systems under development at the time, without some of their historical decisions[citation needed]. Bazaar was originally intended as a test-bed for features to be later integrated into Baz, but by mid-2005 many of the major Baz developers had begun working primarily on Bazaar directly, so Baz was abandoned instead.[16]
Version 1.0 of Bazaar was released in December 2007.[23] In February 2008, Bazaar became a GNU project.[1]
