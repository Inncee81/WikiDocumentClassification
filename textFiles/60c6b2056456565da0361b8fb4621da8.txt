[edit] History

[edit] Formation
Goldwasser and VanWyngarden formed the band while attending Wesleyan University during their freshman year.[14] "We weren't trying to start a band," remarked Goldwasser. "We were just hanging out, showing each other music that we liked." They experimented with noise rock, electronica and hallucinogens before settling on what David Marchese of Spin magazine calls "their current brand of shape-shifting psychedelic pop."[15] They graduated in 2005 and toured extensively in support of the Time to Pretend EP, opening for indie rock band Of Montreal.[16]

[edit] Oracular Spectacular

In the autumn of 2006 Maureen Kenny signed the band to Columbia Records.[6][17] The duo recorded with Flaming Lips music producer Dave Fridmann in 2007 for their major label debut, Oracular Spectacular.[18] MGMT opened for Of Montreal on tour in autumn 2007 as a five piece touring band including Matthew Asti (bass), James Richardson (drums), and Hank Sullivant (guitar).[19] As of March 2008, the lineup changed with Will Berman on drums.

MGMT performing at the 2008 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN.


The band supported Radiohead on the Manchester date of their world tour[21] and went on a headline tour of the UK during November 2008, playing at venues such as Manchester Academy and Shepherd's Bush Empire.
MGMT performed at both the 2008 SXSW Music Festival and Austin City Limits festivals in Austin, the first day of Bonnaroo 2008, Coachella Music Festival, performed twice at Glastonbury 2008, and also played Roskilde Festival, Reading Festival, partnering Leeds Festival, T in the Park and the Irish Oxegen Festival (where fans and spectators scaled the tent's internal rigging towers causing the gig to be temporarily stopped for 20 minutes). They also played at Lollapalooza and the Osheaga (Canada) festival as well as Summersonic (Japan), Oeiras Alive! (Portugal) and Rock Werchter (Belgium) in 2008. August 2008 saw the band play the Hungary Sziget Festival, UK Reading and Leeds Festival, & at Lowlands in Holland, where they played their album integrally live. They also played at the Toronto Virgin Festival in 2008.
MGMT opened for M.I.A. on the Vassar College date of her 2008 tour,[22] and also played several shows with Beck while he toured in 2008. They also toured Australia with a headlining spot on the Meredith Music Festival line-up. They played a show at the Virgin Vestival on Toronto Island on September sixth, playing nine songs off their Oracular Spectacular album (nine out of ten), ending with their smash hit 'Kids'. They also played the 2008 Street Scene festival in San Diego, CA; at this performance they played a bluegrass-influenced version of their song "Pieces of What". MGMT performed alongside Spectrum at "The Dome" in Finsbury Park on February 27, 2009.

[edit] Legal proceedings
MGMT is currently involved in a legal dispute with the President of France Nicolas Sarkozy. The song "Kids" was used on several occasions without permission, at a party conference and in two online videos. The UMP, Sarkozy's political party, admitted that the song had been used without permission and offered a symbolic compensation of €1. The band rejected the offer, claiming it was "insulting".[23] The band's lawyer commented that "We are dealing with acts of counterfeiting, with infringements of intellectual property."[24] Nicolas Sarkozy is known as a vocal supporter of stricter intellectual property laws.[25]

[edit] Band name pronunciation
There has been some confusion over how to pronounce the band name. The band and their label confirmed that the correct pronunciation is to say the individual letters (Em-Gee-Em-Tee).[26] whilst Rolling Stone claims the name is pronounced 'management' as the previous band name.[27]
