HTTP Headers form the core of an HTTP request, and are very important in an HTTP response. They define various characteristics of the data that is requested or the data that has been provided. The headers are separated from the request or response body by a blank line. HTTP headers can be near-arbitrary strings, but only some are commonly understood.

[edit] Avoiding Caching
If the server responds with Cache-Control: no-cache then a web browser or other caching system must not use the response to satisfy subsequent responses without first checking with the originating server. This header is part of HTTP/1.1, and is ignored by some caches and browsers. To make sure that an object is not cached, it is therefore sensible to also set the Expires HTTP 1.0 header to a value earlier than the response date (e.g. -1). This is interpreted as an instruction not to cache by HTTP/1.0 caches and browsers.
The fact that a resource is not to be cached is no guarantee that it will not be written to disk. In particular, the HTTP/1.1 definition draws a distinction between history stores and caches. If you use navigation buttons to go back to a previous page a browser may still show you a page that has been stored on disk in the history store, even if it has been instructed not to cache that page. This is correct behaviour according to the specification. Many user agents (including both Firefox and IE) will show different behaviour with regards to loading something from history store and loading something from its cache depending on whether the protocol is http or https.
In the rare event that you specifically do not want a resource to be stored to disk anywhere - perhaps the resource is highly sensitive and you don't want it to appear in backups or to be written to insecure permanent storage - you can use the header Cache-Control: no-store. This does not guarantee that the resource will not be written, but instructs the browser to make a best effort not to write it, or in the worst case, that it does not remain on disk.
The Pragma: no-cache header is an HTTP/1.0 header intended for use in requests. It is a means for the browser to tell the server and any intermediate caches that it wants a fresh version of the resource, not for the server to tell the browser not to cache the resource. Some user agents do pay attention to this header in responses (e.g. some versions of IE, but only when using https), but the HTTP/1.1 RFC specifically warns against relying on this behaviour.
