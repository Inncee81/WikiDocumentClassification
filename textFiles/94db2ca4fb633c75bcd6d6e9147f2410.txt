A recursive acronym (or occasionally recursive initialism, and sometimes recursive backronym) is an abbreviation that refers to itself in the expression for which it stands. The term was first used in print in April 1986[1].

[edit] Computer-related examples
In computing, an early tradition in the hacker community (especially at MIT) was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context, from about 1977 or 1978, is TINT ("TINT Is Not TECO"), an editor for MagicSix. This inspired the two MIT Lisp Machine editors called EINE ("EINE Is Not Emacs") and ZWEI ("ZWEI Was EINE Initially"). These were followed by Richard Stallman's GNU (GNU's not UNIX). Many others also include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from).
Noted efforts include:

AROS — AROS Research Operating System (note: originally Amiga Research Operating System)
Allegro — Allegro Low LEvel Game ROutines (note: the acronym was originally Atari Low LEvel Game ROutines until development shifted away from the Atari ST)
CAVE — Cave Automatic Virtual Environment
Cygnus — Cygnus, Your GNU Support
giFT — giFT: Internet File Transfer
GiNaC — GiNaC is Not a CAS (Computer Algebra System)
GNE — GNE's Not an Encyclopedia
GNU — GNU's Not Unix
JACK — JACK Audio Connection Kit
JOE — Joe's Own Editor
KAGE — KAGE: Alternative Game Engine
KINACS — KINACS is not a circuit simulator
LAME — LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder[2]
LiVES — LiVES is a Video Editing System
MiCRS - MiCRS is a Car Rental System
MiNT — MiNT is Not TOS (later changed to "MiNT is Now TOS")
MINT — MINT Is Not TRAC
Mung — Mung Until No Good[3]
Nagios — Nagios Ain't Gonna Insist On Sainthood
NiL — NiL Isn't Liero
NINJA - Ninja Is Not Just Air[4]
PHP — PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (originally "Personal Home Page" tools, officially changed for PHP 3)[5]
PINE — PINE Is Nearly Elm, originally; PINE now officially stands for "Pine Internet News and E-mail"[6]
PIPS — PIPS Is POSIX on Symbian OS
RPM — RPM Package Manager (originally "Red Hat Package Manager")
Scaled — Scaled Composites: Advanced Link to Efficient Development
SPARQL — SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language
TiLP — TiLP is a Linking Program
TIP — TIP isn't Pico (original name for Nano text editor)
UIRA — UIRA Isn't a Recursive Acronym
WAM - WAM Account Manager
Wine — Wine Is Not an Emulator[7]
XBMC — XBMC Media Center (originally Xbox Media Center)
XINU — Xinu Is Not Unix
XNA — XNA's Not Acronymed
YAML — YAML Ain't Markup Language (initially "Yet Another Markup Language")
Zinf — Zinf Is Not FreeA*p
ZINC — ZINC Is Not CMS


[edit] Mutually recursive or otherwise special

The GNU Hurd project is named with a mutually recursive acronym: "Hurd" stands for "Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons", and "Hird" stands for "Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth."


The GNUBrain project is another mutually recursive acronym: "Brain" stands for "Brian relates any independent node" and "Brian" stands for "Brain implements a network".


RPM and PHP were originally conventional initialisms which were later redefined recursively. They are not true backronyms, however, as the names were already abbreviations and are pronounced as initials rather than as words.


Jini claims the distinction of being the first recursive anti-acronym. 'Jini Is Not Initials'. It might, however, be more properly termed an anti-backronym because the term "Jini" never stood for anything in the first place. The more recent "XNA," on the other hand, was deliberately designed that way.


Most recursive acronyms are recursive on the first letter, which is therefore an arbitrary choice, often selected for reasons of humour or ease of pronunciation. However YOPY, "Your own personal YOPY" is recursive on the last letter (hence the last letter had to be the same as the first).


[edit] Non-technical examples
Recursive acronyms are not limited to computing terminology. For example:

TIARA — TIARA is a recursive acronym [8]
SHaBBaT — Shena Bashabbat Ta'anug (Sabbath — Sleep on the Sabbath is a Pleasure; שבת — שנה בשבת תענוג), a Hebrew recursive acronym from the seventeenth century Yalkut Re'ubeni Va-ethannan, quoted in Bialik and Ravnitky's Sefer Ha-Aggadah.

Some companies have been named or renamed in this way:

BWIA — BWIA West Indies Airways (formerly British West Indian Airways)
GES — GES Exposition Services (formerly Greyhound Exposition Services)
LINK — Link Interchange NetworK, the UK ATM switching organisation.
SAAB — Saab Automobile Aktiebolaget (formerly Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget.)
VISA — Visa International Service Association
ADAP — ADAP Discount Auto Parts

There are also some organizations that employ recursive acronyms:

KLuB — Klub Linux Bandung (Linux Club of Bandung city)
MOMS Club — MOMS Offering Moms Support

On 16 March 2008 perhaps the first human being named with a recursive acronym was born in Germany. The boy's first name LIAS stands for “Lias Is Adrienne's Son.”[9]

[edit] Fictional examples

In Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, published 1979, Douglas Hofstadter uses the acronym GOD, 'GOD Over Djinn'. As a genie explains to Achilles, GOD stands for GOD Over Djinn, remarking that "GOD can never be fully expanded." In the German translation it is rendered as "ZEUS ewig über Schinn", meaning "Zeus eternally over Djinn".
KOS-MOS — Kosmos Obey Strategical Multiple Operation Systems, from the video game series Xenosaga.
A recursive initialism appeared in a Dilbert comic strip, in which Dilbert states that the TTP project refers to The TTP Project (this is also an infinitely-redundant case of RAS syndrome).
In Twin Peaks, Laura Palmer figured that her nemesis, Bob, was an acronym for "Beware of Bob"
In the Archie Comics series Sonic the Hedgehog, the digital son of Eggman is named A.D.A.M., which has two meanings, one of which is "A.D.A.M. Determines Anonymous' Movements".
In an episode of M*A*S*H, Radar O'Reilly refers to A.W.O.L as "A.W.O.L. without official leave".
In the DC Comics series Atari Force, ATARI originally stood for "Atari Technology And Research Institute," though this was changed to "Advanced Technology And Research Institute" in later issues.
In an episode of The Simpsons, Homer defines GRUNGE as Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energy.
