Apophysis




Latest release
2.08 beta / August 8th, 2008


Written in
Delphi


Operating system
Microsoft Windows


Type
Fractal / Graphics


License
GNU General Public License


Website
www.apophysis.org


Apophysis is a fractal flame editor and renderer for Microsoft Windows. It was created by Mark Townsend by translating Scott Draves' original C code into Delphi and adding a graphical user interface. It has since been improved and updated by Peter Sdobnov, Piotr Borys, and Ronald Hordijk (the SourceForge project developers). It is open source, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Apophysis has many features for creating and editing fractal flames, including an editor which allows one to directly edit the transforms that comprise the fractal flame, a mutations window, which applies random edits to the triangles, an adjust window, which allows the adjustment of coloring and location of the image, and even a scripting language with direct access to most of the components of the fractal, which allows for effects such as the animations seen in Electric Sheep, which are also fractal flames. Users can export fractal flames to other fractal flame rendering programs, such as FLAM3.
Apophysis has also recently been modified to create 3D fractals.

[edit] Apophysis scripts
Apophysis uses the Scripter Studio scripting library to allow users to write scripts which run and either create a new flame, edit the existing flames, or do bigger tasks. One such instance is rendering an entire batch of fractals.
