awesome is a dynamic window manager for the X Window System. Its development began in September 2007 as a fork of dwm[2]. It aims at being extremely small and fast and supports multiple layouts such as floating, tiling, and maximized. Like many other tiling window managers, it strives to make it possible for the user to productively manage windows without the use of the mouse.
awesome is distributed on a wide range of Unix-like operating systems, including Arch Linux, Debian, PLD Linux, Ubuntu, Gentoo, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
The 3.0 version, released September 18, 2008, uses the XCB library to communicate with the X server[3], making awesome the first window manager to use this library instead of Xlib. It also supports the pango markup language, and D-Bus for communication.
The name of the window manager is intended to be autological.
