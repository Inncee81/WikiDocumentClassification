Omakase (お任せ ?) is a Japanese phrase that means "It's up to you" (from 任す, entrust).

[edit] Restaurants
The expression is used at sushi restaurants to leave the selection to the chef. It differs from ordering à la carte.[1] The chef will generally present a series of plates, beginning with the lightest fare and proceeding to heaviest, richest dishes.[2] The phrase is not exclusive to service of raw fish with rice, and can incorporate grilling and simmering as well.[3] Customers ordering omakase style expect the chef to be innovative and surprising in the selection of dishes, and the meal can be likened to an artistic performance by the chef.[4] Ordering omakase can be a gamble; however, the customer typically receives the highest quality fish the restaurant currently has in stock at a price cheaper than if it was ordered à la carte[citation needed]. From the restaurant's perspective, a large number of customers ordering omakase can help in planning for food costs.[5]
