From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In American mathematics education, precalculus, an advanced form of secondary school algebra, is a foundational mathematical discipline. It is also called introduction to Analysis. In many schools, Pre-Calculus is actually two separate courses: Algebra and Trigonometry. Pre-Calculus does not prepare students for Calculus as Pre-Algebra prepares students for Algebra 1. While Pre-Algebra teaches students many different fundamental algebra topics, Pre-Calculus does not involve calculus, but explores topics that will be applied in calculus.
In detail, precalculus deals with:

Sets
Real numbers
Complex numbers
Solving inequalities and equations
Properties of functions
Composite function
Polynomial functions
Rational functions
Trigonometry
Trigonometric functions and their inverses
Trigonometric identities
Conic sections
Exponential functions
Logarithmic functions
Sequences and series
Binomial theorem
Vectors
Parametric equations
Polar coordinates
Matrices
Mathematical induction
Limits
