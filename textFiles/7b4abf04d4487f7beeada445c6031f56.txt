A single engine aircraft's (Cessna 150L) airspeed indicator with V speeds labeled


In aviation, V-speeds or Velocity-speeds are standard terms used to define airspeeds important or useful to the operation of aircraft, such as airplanes, gliders, autogiros, helicopters, blimps, and dirigibles.[1] These speeds are derived from data obtained by aircraft designers and manufacturers during flight testing and verified in most countries by government flight inspectors during aircraft type-certification testing. Using them is considered a best practice to maximize aviation safety, aircraft performance or both.[2]
The actual speeds represented by these designators are true airspeeds specific to a particular model of aircraft, and are expressed in terms of the aircraft's indicated airspeed, so that pilots may use them directly, without having to apply correction factors.
In general aviation aircraft, the most commonly-used and most safety-critical airspeeds are displayed as color-coded arcs and lines located on the face of an aircraft's airspeed indicator. The lower ends of the green arc and the white arc are the stalling speed with wing flaps retracted, and stalling speed with wing flaps fully extended, respectively. These are the stalling speeds for the aircraft at its maximum weight.[3][4]
Having V speeds properly displayed is an airworthiness requirement for type-certificated aircraft in most parts of the world.[4][5]

[edit] Regulation
The most common V-speeds are often defined by a particular government's aviation regulations. In the United States, these are defined in title 14 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, known as the Federal Aviation Regulations or FARs.[6] In Canada, the regulatory body, Transport Canada, defines 26 commonly-used V-speeds in their Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).[7]

[edit] Regulatory V-speeds
These V-speeds are defined by government regulations.


V-speed designator
Description


V1
Maximum speed during takeoff at which a pilot can safely stop the aircraft without leaving the runway. This is also the minimum speed that allows the pilot to safely continue (to V2 takeoff) even if a critical engine failure occurs (between V1 and V2).[6][7][8]


V2
Takeoff safety speed.[6][7][8]


V2min
Minimum takeoff safety speed.[6][7][8]


V3
Flap retraction speed.[7][8]




VA
Design maneuvering speed, also known as the "Speed for maximum control deflection." This is the speed above which it is unwise to make full application of any single flight control (or "pull to the stops") as it may generate a force greater than the aircraft's structural limitations.[6][7][9][8]


VB
Design speed for maximum gust intensity.[6][7][8]


VC
Design cruising speed, also known as the optimum cruise speed, is the most efficient speed in terms of distance, speed and fuel usage.[6][7][9][8]


VD
Design diving speed.[6][7][8]


VDF
Demonstrated flight diving speed.[6][7][8]


VEF
The speed at which the critical engine is assumed to fail during takeoff.[6]


VF
Designed flap speed.[6][7][8]


VFC
Maximum speed for stability characteristics.[6][8]


VFE
Maximum flap extended speed.[6][7][8]


VFTO
Final takeoff speed.[6]


VH
Maximum speed in level flight at maximum continuous power.[6][7][8]


VLE
Maximum landing gear extended speed. This is the maximum speed at which it is safe to fly a retractable gear aircraft with the landing gear extended.[6][7][8][10]


VLO
Maximum landing gear operating speed. This is the maximum speed at which it is safe to extend or retract the landing gear on a retractable gear aircraft.[6][7][8][10]


VLOF
Lift-off speed.[6][8]


VMC
Minimum control speed with Critical engine inoperative.[6][7][8]


Vmcg
Minimum control speed on the ground - the minimum airspeed at which the aircraft is directionally controllable during acceleration along the runway with one engine inoperative, takeoff power on the operative engine(s), and with nose wheel steering assumed inoperative.[8][11]


VMO
Maximum operating limit speed.[6][7][8]


VMU
Minimum unstick speed.[6][7][8]


VNE
Never exceed speed.[6][7][8][12]


VNO
Maximum structural cruising speed or maximum speed for normal operations.[6][7][8]


VR
Rotation speed. The speed at which the airplane's nosewheel leaves the ground.[6][7][8]


VRef
Landing reference speed or threshold crossing speed.[6][7][8]


VS
Stall speed or minimum steady flight speed for which the aircraft is still controllable.[6][7][8]


VS0
Stall speed or minimum flight speed in landing configuration.[6][7][8]


VS1
Stall speed or minimum steady flight speed for which the aircraft is still controllable in a specific configuration.[6][7]


VSR
Reference stall speed.[6]


VSR0
Reference stall speed in landing configuration.[6]


VSR1
Reference stall speed in a specific configuration.[6]


VSW
Speed at which the stall warning will occur.[6]


VTOSS
Category A rotorcraft takeoff safety speed.[6][12]


VX
Speed that will allow for best angle of climb.[6][7]


VY
Speed that will allow for the best rate of climb.[6][7]



[edit] Other V-speeds
Some of these V-speeds are specific to particular types of aircraft and are not defined by government regulations.


V-speed designator
Description


VBE
Best endurance speed – the speed that gives the greatest airborne time for fuel consumed. This may be used when there is reason to remain aloft for an extended period, such as waiting for a forecast improvement in weather on the ground.[9]


VBG
Best power-off glide speed – the speed that provides maximum lift-to-drag ratio and thus the greatest gliding distance available.[9]


VBR
Best range speed – the speed that gives the greatest range for fuel consumed - identical to Vmd.[13]


VFS
Final segment of a departure with one powerplant failed.[14]


Vimd
Minimum drag[15]


Vimp
Minimum power[15]


VLLO
Maximum landing light operating speed – for aircraft with retractable landing lights.[8]


Vmbe
Maximum brake energy speed[16][15]


Vmd
Minimum drag- identical to VBR.[13][16]


Vmca
Minimum control speed in the air – the minimum airspeed at which the aircraft is directionally controllable in flight with one engine inoperative and takeoff power on the operative engine(s). Aircraft certification standards specify the most critical engine becoming inoperative and its propeller windmilling (propeller unfeathered), not more than a 5 degree bank towards the operative engine, takeoff power on the operative engine(s), landing gear up, flaps in the takeoff position, and center of gravity in the most unfavorable position. In the USA Vmca is defined at FAR Part 23.149 for normal category and commuter category airplanes; and Part 25.149 for transport category airplanes.[8]

Vtmax
