[edit] Career
Corbijn decided to move into directing music videos, more or less accidentally.[citation needed] Palais Schaumburg asked him to do one, which he reluctantly accepted. After seeing Video, Propaganda insisted that Corbijn would direct Dr. Mabuse. After that, David Sylvian, Echo & The Bunnymen and Golden Earring asked for his services. Front 242 was presented Corbijn's artwork and accepted shooting a video with him, it resulted in a very strange version of "Headhunter" (which he understood as "Egg Hunter") due to Corbijn's rather limited knowledge of the English language at the time.[1] Nevertheless, it became a milestone in Corbijn's career.
In 1994, after directing various music videos, Corbijn directed a short film about Captain Beefheart for the BBC called Some Yoyo Stuff.
In 2005, Palm Pictures released a DVD collection of Corbijn's music video output as part of the Director's Label series. As well as a 56-page booklet, the DVD also includes outtakes, shorts and documentaries as well as commentaries on various videos from the artists themselves.
On 17 May 2007 Corbijn's first feature film Control about the life of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis premiered to rave reviews at the Cannes Film Festival.[2] The film is based on Deborah Curtis's book Touching From A Distance about her late husband and the new biography Torn Apart by Lindsay Reade (Tony Wilson's ex-wife) and Mick Middles. Although shown outside the Palme d'Or competition, Control was the big winner of the Director's Fortnight winning the CICAE Art & Essai prize for best film, the "Regards Jeunes" Prize award for best first or second directed feature film and the Europa Cinemas Label prize for best European film in the sidebar.[3]
