[edit] Plot



This section requires expansion.


Midnight's Children is a loose allegory for events in India both before and, primarily, after the independence and partition of India, which took place at midnight on 15 August 1947. The protagonist and narrator of the story is Saleem Sinai, a telepath with an extraordinary nose. The novel is divided into three books.

[edit] Book One
The first section details both the peculiar roots of the Sinai family and the earlier events leading up to India's Independence and Partition, connecting the two lines both literally and allegorically. Saleem is born at the exact moment that India becomes independent. From that point on, Saleem Sinai feels the pressure of his chronology and invests his life and narrative in describing the zeitgeist of his child- and adulthood.

[edit] Book Two
During his childhood, Saleem discovers that he, as well as all children born in India between 12 AM and 1 AM on August 15, 1947, are imbued with special powers. A significant portion of the plot details the attempt by Saleem to use his powers to convene the eponymous children. The convention, or Midnight Children's Conference, is in many ways reflective of the issues India faced in its early statehood concerning the cultural, linguistic, religious, and political differences faced by such a vastly diverse nation. Saleem acts as a telepathic conduit, bringing hundreds of geographically disparate children into contact while also attempting to discover the meaning of their shared miraculousness.
Saleem's Muslim family emigrates to Pakistan and back in the decades after the Partition, but during the Indian-Pakistan War Saleem simultaneously loses the majority of his family in an air raid.

[edit] Book Three
Saleem suffers an amnesia-inducing accident that lands him a curious position in the Pakistani army. Again, the strange trail of his life affect and are affected by the history of the Subcontinent as he participates in the 1971 war between East Pakistan and West Pakistan.
Saleem enters a quasi-mythological exile in the jungle of Sundarban, where he is re-endowed with his memory. He then returns to human settlements in Bangladesh, where he not only discovers old childhood friends from Bombay but also now slightly older Midnight Children. He accompanies one back to Delhi illegally, where, in failing to reconnect with the remnants of his biological family, he takes up residence (and a wife) in a ghetto of street performers and Communists. Meanwhile, Indian politics continues, and eventually reclaims him during the Indira Gandhi-proclaimed Emergency and her son Sanjay's "cleansing" of the Jama Masjid slum.
For a time Saleem is held as a political prisoner; these passages contain scathing criticisms of Indira Gandhi's overreach during the Emergency as well as what Rushdie seems to see as a personal lust for power bordering on godhood.
The Emergency signals the end of the potency of the Midnight Children, and there is little left for Saleem to do pick of the few pieces of his life he may still find and write the chronicle that encompasses both his personal history and that of his still-young nation; a chronicle written for his son, who is equally chained to history by birth but also possesses the potential for the miraculous.

[edit] Major themes
The technique of magical realism finds liberal expression throughout the novel and is crucial to constructing the parallel to the country's history. It has thus been compared to One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez.
The narrative framework of Midnight's Children consists of a tale -- comprising his life story -- which Saleem Sinai recounts orally to his wife-to-be Padma. This self-referential narrative (within a single paragraph Saleem refers to himself in the first person: 'And I, wishing upon myself the curse of Nadir Khan. ...'; ' "I tell you," Saleem cried, "it is true. ..."') recalls indigenous Indian culture, particularly the similarly orally recounted One Thousand and One Nights. The events in Rushdie's text also parallel the magical nature of the narratives recounted in the One Thousand and One Nights (consider the attempt to electrocute Saleem at the latrine (p.353), or his journey in the 'basket of invisibility' (p.383)).[4]
The novel is also an expression of the author's own childhood, his affection for the city of Bombay (now Mumbai) in those times, and the tumultuous variety of the Indian subcontinent. Recognised for its remarkably flexible and innovative use of the English language, with a liberal mix of native Indian languages, this novel represents a departure from conventional Indian English writing. Compressing Indian cultural history, "Once upon a time," Saleem muses, "there were Radha and Krishna, and Rama and Sita, and Laila and Majnun; also (because we are not unaffected by the West) Romeo and Juliet, and Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn" (359), Midnight's Children chronologically entwines characters from India's cultural history with characters from Western culture, and the devices that they signify -- Indian culture, religion and storytelling, Western drama and cinema -- are presented in Rushdie's text with postcolonial Indian history to examine the effect of these indigenous and non-indigenous cultures on the Indian mind and in the light of Indian independence.[4]

[edit] Literary significance and criticism
From its publication in 1981, Midnight’s Children has become a standard work on university syllabi and has enjoyed an international readership that catapulted its author almost overnight to the very forefront of world authors. It was awarded the 1981 Booker Prize, the English Speaking Union Literary Award, and it was awarded the James Tait Prize. It also was awarded the Best Of The Booker prize twice, in 1993 and 2008 (this was an award given out by the Booker committee to celebrate the 25th and 40th anniversary of the award).[2] In 2003 the novel was adapted to the stage by the Royal Shakespeare Company.[5]
It has been compared in its scope and execution to works such as James Joyce’s Ulysses, Günter Grass’s The Tin Drum and Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy. Like them, Rushdie’s novel presents an encyclopaedic exploration of an entire society through the story of a single person. It is able to do this, in part, by merging with the novel form a number of non-Western texts such as the Sanskrit epics, The Ramayana, The Mahabharata and, most consciously One Thousand and One Nights.
The novel ran into some controversy for its open criticism of Indira Gandhi, India's then prime minister, and the Emergency that she imposed on the country.
Rushdie wrote a television adaptation of his own novel in five episodes, which was about to begin filming in Sri Lanka when the government abruptly withdrew its permission and the project had to be abandoned. Rushdie published his adaptation as The Screenplay of Midnight's Children (London: Vintage, 1999).
