Joshua Schachter


Joshua Schachter (born 1974) is the creator of Delicious, creator of geoURL and co-creator of Memepool. He has a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Schachter released the first version of Delicious (then called del.icio.us) in September 2003. The service coined the term social bookmarking and featured tagging, a system he'd invented for organizing links suggested to Memepool and publishing some of them on his personal linkblog, Muxway.[1] On March 29, 2005, Schachter announced he would work full-time on Delicious. On December 9, 2005, Yahoo! acquired Delicious for an undisclosed sum.[2] According to Business 2.0, the acquisition was close to $30 million, with Schachter's share being worth approximately $15 million.[3]
Prior to working full-time on Delicious, Schachter was an analyst in Morgan Stanley's Equity Trading Lab.[4] He created geoURL[5] in 2002 and ran it until 2004.
On June 19, 2008, Schachter announced his decision to leave Yahoo!. Techcrunch reported that the recent news coming out of Yahoo! about mass resignations of senior staff pressed his decision to leave. Joshua also said that he had no future plans but would instead join the "gloriously unemployed".[6]
As of January 12, 2009, he is working for Google.[7]
