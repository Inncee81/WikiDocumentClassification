Jupiter and Juno, by Agostino Carracci


Hieros Gamos or Hierogamy (Greek ιερός γάμος, ιερογαμία "holy wedding") refers to sexual intercourse or marriage between a god and a goddess, especially when enacted in a symbolic ritual where human participants represent the deities. Such rituals from a secular viewpoint are also known as religious prostitution or temple prostitution.
The notion of hieros gamos does not presuppose actual performance in ritual, but is also used in purely symbolic or mythological context, notably in alchemy and hence in Jungian psychology.

[edit] Historical polytheism
Further information: religious prostitution
In some cases, such as the "Sacred Marriage" of the king of a Sumerian city-state and the High Priestess of Inanna, it served a more practical purpose: since commoners frequently took this opportunity to have sex with their own spouses, it coordinated the births of children so that they would be born in the winter, when there was more time to take care of them. [1]

[edit] Alchemy and Jungian psychology
The hieros gamos is one of the themes that Carl Jung dealt with, in his book Symbols of Transformation.

[edit] Neopaganism
Further information: Sex magic
In Wicca, the Great Rite is a ritual where a dagger is placed by a man point first into a challice held by a woman, symbolizing the divine union of the Hieros gamos. It is mostly performed on Beltane night (1 May 1),
