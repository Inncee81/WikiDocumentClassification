Jumpstyle is a dance and music genre mainly practiced in Europe, specifically the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and northern France. The dance is also called Jumpen (English word Jump + the Dutch suffix -en, meaning "to jump" or "jumping"). Jumpstyle also refers to a style of music to which Jumpstyle can be performed.[1]. Jumpstyle originated in 1997 in Belgium. Jumpstyle is an off-shoot of the Gabber music and dance scene.[2]

[edit] Performance




Performing Jumpstyle (from Koefnoen, a Dutch parody tv-programme)


The modern dance associated with Jump, has evolved from the hakken-dance (known from gabber music which was popular in the 90s). The modern jump dance is also called skiën (lit. "skiing"). Performance by more than one person is the most popular. The legs are the most important part of the body in jumpstyle. It is performed by a series of forward and backward swings of the legs on the rhythm of the music. The most simple form of jumpstyle can be done as follows:[3]

The dancer swings his/her right leg forward twice. His/her foot would be at the same height his/her knee.
The dancer would then raise his/her left leg.
The dancer then swings his/her left leg backwards. Similar to the original step, the foot would be level with the knee.
The left leg would be put onto the ground, in front of the right foot.
The dancer would repeat this.

More difficult paces include those with turns, twists and so on.

[edit] Music
The music which accompanies Jumpstyle is an offspring of Happy Hardcore and Gabber. Its tempo is usually between 140 and 150 BPM. However, it cannot be seen as merely a slowed down version of gabber. It is characterized by a 909 kick drum used in a 4 to the floor beat. It also has influences from Chicago House.[4] Because of the big hype around the dance and music style itself in 2007 and 2008, it suffers from image-problems in especially The Netherlands. Because of this, the euphoric/melodic Jump like it was made around 2006 till 2008 is not being released anymore these days. However, there are still some radiostations left, broadcasting Jump in it's traditional form. The oldest Jump radio was founded in 2005 and still exists today under the name of JumpStation.FM[5].

[edit] Variations

Jumpstyle can be performed in various ways:

Oldskool jump: Was based on the first move that was used in the dance called 'skieën'. Later a certain standard routine came that was a combination of kicking forwards and backwards both legs on the basslines; even later certain moves came such as a spin.


Tekstyle: The jumper dances to French tek or Hardstyle. This style is "freestyle" (Meaning that the dance moves are improvised).


Hardjump: This is the hardest variant of Jumpstyle. The basic step is different from the others and the jumper has to pitch hard on the ground.


Freestyle: With this style, the Jumper does whatever he/she feels like; there are no specific restrictions of jumping and it usually involves a mix of Oldskool Jump & Hardjump & tekstyle. This is differentiated from Tekstyle in that the music used is not French tek.


Duojump: Jumping with two (or more) people at the same time; usually the two performers have practiced the routine before performing it.


Starstyle: This style is danced over a longer horizontal distance.


[edit] Quotes on Jumpstyle

"Jumpstyle has become a lifestyle, like hip-hop or techno. For me, it’s the best party music around. There’s no other style that makes you go so crazy and forget about all your worries."

- Koen Bauweraerts (DJ Coone)[6]
