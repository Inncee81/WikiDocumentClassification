A light bulb


The lightbulb joke is an example of an endless-variations joke and has numerous versions that satirize a wide range of cultures, beliefs, occupations and groups.[1][2] Generally, the punch line is derogatory to the group that is the subject of the joke.
The generally acknowledged "original" goes as follows:

Q. How many [insert target group here] does it take to change a light bulb?
A. Ten — one to hold the light bulb and nine to turn the ladder around.

Most variations follow this scheme:

Q. How many [insert target group here] does it take to change a light bulb?
A. N — one to replace the light bulb and N-1 to [behave in a fashion generally associated with a negative stereotype of that group].

Often the stereotypical behavior will involve elaborate decision-making processes, and/or Byzantine management and supervision of the bulb-changing. The actual bulb changer may be last in the list for extra punch, especially when following a long recital of various supporting roles, each employing more [members of the target group] than the previous one.
