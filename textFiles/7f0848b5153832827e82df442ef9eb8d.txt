Late Night Tales and its predecessor Another Late Night are the names of two related series of DJ mix albums released on Azuli Records independent record label. The tracks on the albums are selected and mixed by a diverse selection of DJs, recording artists, and bands, asked by Azuli "to compile an album of their favorite music that inspired them to make music their profession - their favourite of the favourites".
Many of the albums end with a story track, read by famous Brits such as Brian Blessed and Patrick Moore.
The 16th album in the series was the first complete spoken word release, performed by David Shrigley, and was released in October 2006. The next mix in the series is Cinematic Orchestra, scheduled for release in March 2009.

[edit] Late Night Live
On 20 November 2005, Late Night Tales started a monthly residency at the Lock Tavern in Camden, London, with guest DJs from the album series plus resident DJs performing live sets.
The first event featured Howie B, and the December 2005 event featured Mark Rae, with both sets lasting around 7 hours. Later sets featured Chris Geddes of Belle & Sebastian in February 2006 and Turin Brakes in March. Geddes also appeared at Late Night launch parties in Manchester and Glasgow in January and February 2006. Later in the year, new artists are likely to appear prior to the release of new Late Night Tales albums, and the events may expand to include spoken word artists, mirroring the closing tracks on the albums.
