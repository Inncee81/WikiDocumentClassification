John Clifton "Jack" Bogle (born May 8, 1929 in Verona, New Jersey) is the founder and retired CEO of The Vanguard Group. He attended Blair Academy on a full scholarship, earned his undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 1951, and attended evening and weekend classes at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon graduation he went to work for Walter L. Morgan at Wellington Management Company. [1]
After successfully climbing through the ranks, he was named chairman of Wellington but was later fired for an "extremely unwise" merger he approved, a poor decision he considers his biggest mistake stating "The great thing about that mistake, which was shameful and inexcusable and a reflection of immaturity and confidence beyond what the facts justified, was that I learned a lot." [2] Bogle then founded Vanguard in 1974. Under his leadership, the company grew to be the second largest mutual fund company in the world. Influenced by the works of Eugene Fama, Burton Malkiel and Paul Samuelson, Mr. Bogle founded the Vanguard 500 Index Fund in 1975 as the first index mutual fund. [3]




Bogle on the cover of Common Sense on Mutual Funds


Bogle is a member of the board of trustees at Blair Academy. He is also an advisory board member of the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at the Yale School of Management. Bogle received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Princeton University in 2005.
He continues to be active in The Vanguard Group.
Bogle also currently serves on the Board of Trustees of the National Constitution Center [1] in Philadelphia, a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. He had previously served as Chairman of the Board from 1999 through 2007. He was named Chairman Emeritus in January 2007, when President George H.W. Bush was named Chairman.
Authors Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, and Michael LeBoeuf wrote a book entitled The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing, teaching John Bogle's basic strategies to the novice investor.[4]
On the popular ABC radio show Moneytalk, Bob Brinker frequently touts Bogle's philosophies on investing and recommends his books, particularly Common Sense on Mutual Funds: New Imperatives for the Intelligent Investor.
Bogle and his wife Eve have six children and are grandparents. They reside in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.

[edit] Investment Strategy
Bogle is famous for his insistence, in numerous media appearances and in writing, on the superiority of index funds over traditional actively-managed mutual funds. He believes that it is folly to attempt to pick actively managed mutual funds and expect their performance to beat a well run index fund over a long period of time.
Bogle argues for an approach to investing defined by simplicity and common sense. Below are his eight basic rules for investors:

Select low-cost funds
Consider carefully the added costs of advice
Do not overrate past fund performance
Use past performance to determine consistency and risk
Beware of stars (as in, star mutual fund managers)
Beware of asset size
Don’t own too many funds
Buy your fund portfolio – and hold it
