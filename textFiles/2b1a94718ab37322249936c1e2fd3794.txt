[edit] Biography




Blueberry is one of Moebius' most famous creations.


Jean Giraud was born in Nogent-sur-Marne, in the suburbs of Paris. At age 16, he began his only technical training at the Arts Appliqués.[2] At 18, he was drawing his own comic strip, "Frank et Jeremie" for the magazine Far West. In 1961, Giraud became an apprentice of Jijé, one of the leading comic artists in Europe of the time, and collaborated on an album of Jerry Spring.[2] In 1962 Giraud and writer Jean-Michel Charlier started the comic strip Fort Navajo for Pilote. It was a great hit and continued uninterrupted until 1974. The Lieutenant Blueberry character, created by Giraud and Charlier for Fort Navajo, quickly became its most popular character, and his adventures as told in the spin-off Western serial Blueberry, are possibly Giraud's best known work in his native France. Giraud's prestige in France – where comics are held in high artistic regard – is enormous; France has even issued postage stamps to commemorate him.[citation needed] Under the names Giraud and Gir, he also wrote numerous comics for other comic artists like Auclair and Tardi.




One of the Starwatcher series of paintings.


The Moebius pseudonym, which Giraud came to use for his science fiction and fantasy work, was born in 1963.[2] In a satire magazine called Hara-Kiri, Moebius did 21 strips in 1963–64 and then disappeared for almost a decade. In 1975 Métal Hurlant (a magazine which he co-created) brought it back and in 1981 he started his famous L'Incal series in collaboration with Alejandro Jodorowsky. Moebius' famous serial The Airtight Garage and his groundbreaking Arzach also began in Métal Hurlant.
Moebius has contributed storyboards and concept designs to numerous science fiction films. In 1982 he collaborated with director René Laloux to create the science fiction feature-length animated movie Les Maîtres du temps (released in English as Time Masters) based on a novel by Stefan Wul. In 1988 Moebius worked on the American comic character The Silver Surfer with Stan Lee for a special two-part limited series. Moebius' take on the character was unfavourably alluded to in the film Crimson Tide by Lt. Commander Ron Hunter (played by Denzel Washington) in deference to that of Silver Surfer co-creator Jack Kirby (in a scene written by an uncredited Quentin Tarantino). Moebius/Giraud is also known to be a friend of filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. From December 2004 to March 2005, the two of them shared an exhibition at La Monnaie in Paris which showcased work by both artists.[citation needed] He even named his daughter Nausicaä from Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.[3][4]
Jean Giraud drew the first of the two-part last volume of the XIII series titled La Version Irlandaise (The Irish Version) from a script by Jean Van Hamme, to accompany the second part by the regular team Jean Van Hamme-William Vance, Le dernier round (The Last Round). Both parts were published on the same date (13 November 2007).[5]

[edit] Style
His graphic style can change dramatically and adapt to the style and the tone of the series. It ranges from the extreme realism of the beginning of his career as in the Aventures du lieutenant Blueberry, started in 1963, to dream-like nature in more recent works. He has drawn etchings, white and black illustrations, work in colour of the ligne claire genre, water colours.[6]
Most of his own series are related to fantastical and delirious science fiction. several contain poetic element, and some are also related to metaphysics. In fact, censorship was quite strong in the 1960, including in Pilote, which was a magazine for children, and Moebius could really express himself thanks to its own series published in Metal Hurlant, for example. He was one of the most influential artists in France who contributed to the emergence of comics for an adult public.
The artist's working methods were also various and adaptable. Giraud's solo Blueberry works were sometimes criticized by the fans of the series, because the artist had dramatically changed the tone of the series as well as the graphic style.[7] However, Blueberry's early success was also due to Giraud's genius, as he did not contended himself with following Charlier indications, and has an important role of adaptation as an artist.[8]
Moebius used to draw a lot on notebooks, several of which were displayed at the occasion of exhibitions. Besides the jewels of the notebooks, numerous original drawings, and comic strips have been also on display. Moebius draws very quickly, and is known as one of the fastest artists. [9] His narrative techniques , his work for films and responses to his work in the world of architecture make him an important and unique artist.

Mister Gir & Mike S. Blueberry (1999) - A documentary portrait by Canadian filmmaker Damian Pettigrew produced by the Centre National de la Bande Dessinée in Angoulême, France. Giraud does numerous sketches and watercolors of his most famous creation, Blueberry, travels to Saint Malo for the celebrated comic-book festival, visits his Paris editor Dargaud, and in the film's last sequence, does a spontaneous life-size portrait in real time of Geronimo on a huge sheet of glass using a felt-tipped pen.


Fellini: I'm a Born Liar (2002) Giraud conceived the poster for the documentary's 2003 North American release and appears in the DVD bonus extras of the French version.


Blueberry (2004) - On the DVD extras Giraud talks about the comic, the film etc, dressed in period costume, apparently having done a cameo role in the film. In IMDB, Giraud is credited as a writer and uncredited actor in the film.


Thru the Moebius Strip (2005)
Giraud worked on Alejandro Jodorowsky's film adaptation of Dune which was never completed.


Giraud's artwork for the Dan O'Bannon short story comic "The Long Tomorrow" was a key visual reference for Blade Runner.


Giraud represented the jury of the Paris Storyboard Contest 2005 (Concours SOPADIN - Société Parisienne des Images Nouvelles) and awarded the two young artists and filmmakers "K-Michel Parandi" (K Parandi) & "Jean François Guillon" for their work on the independent film "Minuit 14". Jean Giraud was assisted on this by the notorious French director "Gerard Krawczyk" (Taxi, Fanfan la tulipe).


George Lucas used one of Giraud's designs for the Imperial Probe Droid in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Lucas' later Star Wars films also share many visual characteristics with Giraud's work, particularly the depiction of the city-planet Coruscant.


Giraud also shared "Story by" credit on the animated film Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland.
Strange frame (2009)


[edit] Video games

Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon (1998)
An arcade and bar based on Giraud's work, called The Airtight Garage, was one of the original main attractions at the Metreon in San Francisco when the complex opened in 1999. It included three original games: Quaternia, a first-person shooter networked between terminals and based on the concept of "junctors" from Major Fatal and The Airtight Garage; a virtual reality bumper cars game about mining asteroids; and Hyperbowl, an obstacle course bowling game incorporating very little overtly Moebius imagery. The arcade was closed and reopened as "Portal One", retaining much of the Moebius-based decor and Hyperbowl but eliminating the other originals in favor of more common arcade games.
