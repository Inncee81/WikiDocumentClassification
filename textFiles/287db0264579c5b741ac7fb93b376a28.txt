[edit] History
Crystal Castles, named after the Crystal Castle from She-Ra: Princess of Power[9], formed in December 2003 as a project started by Ethan Kath (then of Kill Cheerleader). In April 2005, Alice Glass recorded vocals for five original instrumentals by Kath. The band's first single was recorded "accidentally": a microphone test by Glass was released through MySpace as "Alice Practice" in September 2005. Glass was not aware that it had been used until record companies heard the song and contacted the duo to offer them record deals.[10]
Since the release of "Alice Practice", the duo released their first full-length album on Last Gang Records, in North America on March 18, 2008 and in the UK on April 28, 2008.[11]

[edit] Touring
Crystal Castles have toured Europe and the USA numerous times since 2006, including a US tour with the Australian electronic group The Presets in February 2007.[12][13][14] The band also played at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in England, August 2007[15] and were set to play the CMJ Festival October 2007.[16][17][18][19] They supported Metric on certain dates throughout their North American tour in September and October 2007[20][21][22] and also headlined Vice Magazine's UK tour in November 2007 called Unitaur, which also featured These New Puritans, and The Teenagers.[23]
In May 2008, Crystal Castles headlined the UK's NME New Noise tour along with Laura Joy Friendly Fires, Team Waterpolo and White Lies.
Crystal Castles performed at the Glastonbury Festival in June 2008, where the on-stage antics of Glass which included her climbing the stage rigging and constantly stage-diving, led to the organisers curtailing their set.[24] Crystal Castles toured with Nine Inch Nails in dates across July and August 2008.[25]
Crystal Castles also played various European summer festivals including England's Reading & Leeds Festivals. They were expected to return to the UK in September 2008 for a headlining tour but had to cancel due to recording commitments. The band also played Connect 2008 and in October they played at the Iceland Airwaves festival. Over Halloween they played another rather dramatic gig in LA that involved Alice Glass wrecking the drum kit[26]
Their current live drummer is Michael Bell of Lymbyc Systym. Toronto based drummer, Chris Chartrand is another live drummer they use.

[edit] Copyright disputes
In mid-2008, Crystal Castles were involved in two controversies related to artwork permissions and samples in their earliest unreleased songs. Pitchfork Media and the Torontoist blog published stories about Crystal Castles' use of Trevor Brown's artwork without permission. The image, depicting a black-eyed Madonna,[27][28] was used by the band on merchandise. The issue was resolved after the band bought the rights to use the image from Brown.[29]
Also, in one of Kath's earliest, unreleased demos, he incorporated a sample without permission; the track was released on the MySpace page of the label, Lies Records, without credit to the original sampled song.[30] The track, "Insectica", uses chopped up samples from a song by Lo-bat called "My Little Droid Needs a Hand" (released under a Creative Commons license). Another includes the song "Love and Caring", which samples the kick and snare from Covox's "Sunday".[31][30][32][33] Pitchfork published an article in defense of the band, saying that the band had never released the songs nor performed them and thus were not responsible for breaking the Creative Commons licensing on the songs.[25]

[edit] Musical style
Crystal Castles' music is easily recognized by their heavy use of samples and distorted female vocals. Crystal Castles does not in fact use a modified keyboard with an Atari 5200 sound chip[9] as an oscillator, as it is frequently claimed.[34] Their musical style has been described as having "ferocious, asphyxiating sheets of warped two-dimensional Gameboy glitches and bruising drum bombast pierce [the] skull with sheer shrill force, burrowing deep into the brain like a fever".[35] Indie music review website, Pitchfork, gave a positive review of Crystal Castles' remix of "Leni" by GoodBooks, and described the style as "pitch-shifted vocal snippets [that] ricochet like pinballs around Crystal Castles' patented 8-bit synths".[36]
