[edit] Content

[edit] Advice on dissidence
The book includes advice on such topics as growing marijuana, starting a pirate radio station, living in a commune, stealing food, shoplifting, stealing credit cards, preparing a legal defense, making pipe bombs, and obtaining a free buffalo from the U.S. Department of the Interior. It discusses various tactics of fighting as well as giving a detailed list of affordable and easy ways to find weapons and armor that can be used in the event of a confrontation with law enforcement. The book advocates rebelling against authority in all forms, governmental and corporate.

[edit] The "Pig Empire"
In the book, Hoffman referred to the American Empire as the "Pig Empire", saying that it was not immoral to steal from the "Pig Empire"; in fact, Hoffman wrote, it was immoral not to do so.[1] The term was picked up by the Yippie crowd, and was widely used by what became known as the "Woodstock Nation."[2]

[edit] Cultural response
The book's reflexive title is a classic example of Yippie culture jamming. It is very hard to find in libraries for that same reason.
As the book ages, the specific information it contains has become largely obsolete, but the book captures the yippie zeitgeist.
On the success of the book, Hoffman was quoted as saying, "It's embarrassing when you try to overthrow the government and you wind up on the Best Seller's List." Hoffman would not respond to accusations that he had plagiarized the book, as published in a detailed article in Rolling Stone magazine (No. 92, 10 September 1971), entitled "How Abbie Hoffman Won My Heart and Stole Steal This Book."[3]
As of 2006, the composition of a Wiki-based version of this work for a new generation was started. The project has been named Steal This Wiki. An alpha version of the final product was compiled and released on July 4, 2007.
