[edit] Notes

Stable versions. Note that some distros (e.g Gentoo) use some development versions in case the stable versions are a bit old.
Note that GRUB does not have a stable version, since the program itself is unstable, although many distros use it as default.
Note that HURD is under active development. Because of that, there is no 'stable' version. The Hurd is distributed through version control systems.(cvs)
