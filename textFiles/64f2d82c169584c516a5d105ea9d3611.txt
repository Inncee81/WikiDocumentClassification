[edit] Local only
In the local-only approach, all developers must use the same computer system.

History Explorer - version control by Exendo
PRCS — portable system focussed on atomic operations and simplicity; originally using RCS as a back-end, is said to be being rewritten with a more efficient storage model
Revision Control System (RCS) — features separate backward deltas for faster access to the trunk tip compared to SCCS and an improved user interface, at the cost of slow branch tip access and missing support for included/excluded deltas
Source Code Control System (SCCS) — part of UNIX; based on interleaved deltas, can construct versions as arbitrary sets of revisions


[edit] Distributed model
In the distributed approach, each developer works directly with their own local repository, and changes are shared between repositories as a separate step.

[edit] Open source

Aegis — mature software, filesystem-oriented, poor network support
ArX — started as a fork of GNU arch, but has been completely rewritten
Bazaar — written in Python; decentralised, and aims to be fast and easy to use; can losslessly import Arch archives
Codeville — written in Python; uses an innovative merging algorithm
Darcs — written in Haskell; can keep track of inter-patch dependencies and automatically rearrange and "cherry-pick" them using a "theory of patches"
DCVS — decentralized and CVS-based
Fossil — distributed revision control, wiki, and bug-tracking
Git — designed by Linus Torvalds based on the needs of the Linux kernel project; decentralised, and aims to be fast, flexible, and robust
GNU arch
LibreSource — configuration management
Mercurial — written in Python; decentralised and aims to be fast, lightweight, portable, and easy to use
Monotone — decentralized in a peer-to-peer way
SVK — written in Perl; built on top of Subversion to allow distributed commits
TCL Database-centric Revision control system (tcldbrcs) — database driven RCS on PostgreSQL; no specific server outside of postgres.


[edit] Proprietary

BitKeeper — was used in Linux kernel development (2002 – April 2005)
Code Co-op — peer-to-peer version control system (can use e-mail for synchronization)
Plastic SCM — distributed using replication and synchronization; free for open source projects and education
TeamWare — designed by Larry McVoy, creator of BitKeeper


[edit] Client-server model
In the client-server model, developers use a shared single repository.

[edit] Free

Advanced Versioning System - source configuration management including a bug tracking engine, working in a single SQL database; for Unix and Windows
FileHamster - version control freeware by MOGware.


[edit] Open source

Concurrent Versions System (CVS) — originally built on RCS
CVSNT - cross-platform port of CVS that allows case insensitive file names among other changes
OpenCVS - compatible with CVS, with emphasis put on security and source code correctness
Subversion (svn) — initially released in 2000[1].
Vesta — build system with a versioning file system and support for distributed repositories


[edit] Proprietary

AccuRev — source configuration management tool with integrated issue tracking based on "Streams" that efficiently manages parallel and global development; replication server is also available
Aldon — process-driven Application Lifecycle Management tools
Alienbrain — source configuration management tool by Avid Technology
AllChange — Change and Configuration Management tool by Intasoft.
AllFusion Harvest Change Manager — change and configuration management tool by Computer Associates
Autodesk Vault - Version control tool specifically designed for Autodesk applications managing the complex relationships between design files such as AutoCAD and Autodesk Inventor.
ClearCase — SCC compliant configuration management system by IBM Rational Software
Configuration Management Version Control — IBM version control system, no longer available.
CollabNet Subversion — Subversion binaries compiled, certified and supported by its initiator
codeBeamer - Collaboration and application lifecycle management platform
DesignSync — Configuration management system by MatrixOne
Evolution — version management by ionForge; remote access, branching models, customizable workflow; integrations into development, graphic, and modeling tools
FirePublish - multi-platform staging, version control and publishing application for web-based applications
FtpVC — Utilizes standard FTP servers
IC Manage - design management tools for hardware and software design
MKS Integrity - process-centric enterprise application lifecycle management by MKS Inc.
MOG - work flow and revision software for video game development by MOGware.
MotioCI - version control and Continuous Integration for tools from Motio.
PDMWorks - data management by SolidWorks; with ERP integration and a Windows Explorer-integrated interface
Perforce — Free for use in open source projects.
Polarion ALM - Web portal application that use Subversion for revision control of development artifacts (documents, tasks, change requests, Wiki pages, etc.) in addition to source code
Project Overlord Asset/Project Management Software — designed specifically for CG animation/vfx studios; tracks assets as well as project related data such as shots and tasks
PureCM — version control tool that supports parallel and distributed development using a stream-based approach to branching and merging with integrated issue management
Polytron Version Control System — originally developed by Don Kinzer at Polytron, first released in 1985
Quma Version Control System
Serena Dimensions - successor to PVCS
SourceAnywhere Hosted — hosted source control solution by Dynamsoft.
SourceAnywhere Standalone — SQL-based source control solution
SourceHaven — Originally based on Subversion; adds an embedded Oracle database backend and a web application for administration
StarTeam — coordinates and manages software delivery process by Borland; centralized control of digital assets and activities
Store - source code management and versioning system by Cincom for its Visualworks Smalltalk environment
