[edit] Early Life and Youth Novels
Li was born in Ystad, Skåne, in Sweden, in 1986 and was raised by artistic parents; her mother was a painter, her father is a musician.[1] The family moved to Stockholm when Li was a toddler and later moved to a mountaintop in Portugal when Li was six, where they lived for five years; the family also spent time in Lisbon and Morocco and spent winters in Nepal and India.[1][2] She moved to New York for three months when she was 19.[3][4] She returned when she was 21 to record her album.[5] Contrary to what many believe she has been a backup dancer only once.[5] When not touring, she resides in the Södermalm district of Stockholm.
She released her first album, Youth Novels on LL Recordings in the Nordic region on February 4, 2008 and it received a wider European release in June, 2008. The album was produced by Björn Yttling of Peter Bjorn and John and Lasse Mårtén. It was released in the United States on 6 May 2008. The album was released in the Republic of Ireland on June 6, 2008 and June 9 in the UK. The album was inspired from a previous relationship of three years .
She had some success with the EP "Little Bit" in 2007. Stereogum named her an artist to watch in October 2007 and described her music as a mix of soul, electro and "powdered-sugar pop".[6]
She also appeared on Swedish musician Kleerup's self titled album, contributing vocals to the track "Until We Bleed".
According to her Myspace Blog, she has started writing material for her second album but insists it'll be a long wait until it is finished for fans to hear.[7]
