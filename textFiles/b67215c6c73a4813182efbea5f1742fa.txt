1 The Personalized Intelligent Recording and Scheduling feature, similar to TiVo enables the PVR application to record programs based on past viewing habits and interests.
2 Windows Media Center has the ability to skip commercials automatically after installing an external plug-in called "DVRMSToolbox" (which is not supported by Microsoft) or "Lifextender" .
3 MythTV has the ability to perform Personalized Intelligent Recording and Scheduling after installing an external plug-in called "tvwish" (which is not supported by MythTV).
4 Windows Media Center supports CableCard when used on CableLabs certified OEM Hardware. [2]
5 Supports over-the-air epg when using cards/boxes which support this functionality, and in areas where such a service is available.
6 To take advantage of operating system power management with Beyond TV, the main user interface must be closed.
7 MythTV has switched from the now defunct Zap2It to the $20 per year Schedules Direct.[1]
8 EPG is supported via WebEpg
9 Is Supported by 3rd party plugins. ComSkip[3] and ShowAnalyzer [4]
10 Windows Media Center supports two NTSC (Analog) tuners and two ATSC (Digital) tuners out of the box. Using additional tuners requires registry modifications.
11 Vista Media Center can do partial intelligent recordings. You can do recordings based on key words, actor(s) names, or other genres.
12 Elgato's contract with TitanTV will expire in 2010. When it expires TV Guide will become the sole EPG provider for EyeTV. One year of TV Guide EPG service costs $19.95.[2][3]
