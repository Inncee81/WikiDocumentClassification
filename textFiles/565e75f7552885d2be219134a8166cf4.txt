Although dropped in current version, older versions of the Gecko layout engine for Mac OS 9 are still available for download from Netscape's Archived Products site.
Most of WebKit runs natively on Windows, Safari 3.1 provides support for previously non-ported features such as SVG, Canvas, and plugins.


[edit] WebKit notes
Linux, Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X support are also available with Qt 4.3 in the public WebKit SVN repository.
