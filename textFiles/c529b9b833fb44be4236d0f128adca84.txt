From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
This is an episode list for the science fiction drama Star Trek: Voyager. It began airing on UPN on January 16, 1995 in the United States. The fourth television program in the Star Trek franchise, Star Trek: Voyager came to an end on May 23, 2001, after a final total of 172 episodes aired in seven seasons. This episode list incorporates the stardate on which the events of each episode took place within the Star Trek universe.
Most of the episode titles of Star Trek: Voyager are succinct, tending to consist of one or two words. Most episodes ended with the titular starship flying off-screen before the production credits appear. With the exceptions of seasons 1 and 4, each season was connected with a two-part cliffhanger; and the final two episodes were aired back-to-back in a two-part event.
