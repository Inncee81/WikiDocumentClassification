The zombie apocalypse is a particular scenario of apocalyptic fiction that customarily has a science fiction/horror rationale. In a zombie apocalypse, a widespread (usually global) rise of zombies hostile to human life engages in a general assault on civilization. Victims of zombies may become zombies themselves. This causes the outbreak to become an exponentially growing crisis: the spreading "zombie plague" swamps normal military and law enforcement organizations, leading to the panicked collapse of civilian society until only isolated pockets of survivors remain, scavenging for food and supplies in a world suddenly reduced to a hostile wilderness.

[edit] Genre tropes
There are several common story elements that create a zombie apocalypse:

Apocalypse is created by the unprecedented generation of zombies; an event that has never happened before and impossible by any reasonable definition.[1]
Zombies begin attacking the living with those killed or infected also becoming zombies. Surviving characters react with initial disbelief to events until hostile encounters precipitate further action.[2]
Authorities are slow to respond to the threat giving the zombies time to grow beyond containment. The zombies cannot be controlled despite the broad choice of countermeasures with available technologies. This outcome then results in the collapse of the given society. Zombies take full control while small groups of the living must fight for their survival.[2]

The stories usually follow a single group of survivors, caught up in the sudden rush of the crisis. The narrative generally progresses from the onset of the zombie plague, then initial attempts to seek the aid of authorities, the failure of those authorities, through to the sudden catastrophic collapse of all large-scale organization and the characters' subsequent attempts to survive on their own. Such stories are often squarely focused on the way their characters react to such an extreme catastrophe, and how their personalities are changed by the stress, often acting on more primal motivations (fear, self-preservation) than they would display in normal life.[2][3]
Generally the zombies in these situations are the slow moving kind first made popular in the 1968 film Night of the Living Dead.[1] Recent films, however, have included zombies that are fast, agile, and stronger than the traditional zombie.[4]

[edit] Subtext
The literary subtext of a zombie apocalypse is usually that civilization is inherently fragile in the face of truly unprecedented threats and that most individuals cannot be relied upon to support the greater good if the personal cost becomes too high.[5] The narrative of a zombie apocalypse carries strong connections to the turbulent social landscape of the United States in the 1960s when the originator of this genre, the film Night of the Living Dead, was first created.[6][7] Many also feel that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world.[8] In fact the breakdown of society as a result of zombie infestation has been portrayed in countless zombie-related media since Night of the Living Dead.[9] Kim Paffrenroth notes that "more than any other monster, zombies are fully and literally apocalyptic ... they signal the end of the world as we have known it."[9]

[edit] Fandom
Thanks to large number of films and video games, the idea of a zombie apocalypse has entered the mainstream and there have been efforts by many fans to prepare for the "coming" zombie apocalypse. Efforts include creating weapons[10], selling posters to inform people on how to survive a zombie outbreak[11], and creating websites "documenting" zombie attacks.[12]
At Goucher College students there invented the tag game Humans vs. Zombies where human "survivors" armed with NERF guns face off against "zombies." The game has caused some controversy though in light of the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech and the 2008 shooting at Northern Illinois with some feeling the game belittles how dangerous guns are.[13]
Some notable individuals have discussed what they would do in a zombie apocalypse. Mixed martial artist Nick Denis said "I plan on getting, one, an aluminum bat [and], two, a rope ladder, so if I live in the second level of an apartment, that’d be my exit, in and out the window. And then I’d like to get chainmail. No zombie can bite through that. That’d be a good start for my bag."[14] Adam Cayton-Holland said he tried to practice firing a gun: "in order to prove my worth to the denizens of whatever abandoned hovel I will inevitably hole up in during the zombie attack, I should learn how to fire me a flintlock."[15]
