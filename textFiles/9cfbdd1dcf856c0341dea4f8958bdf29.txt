MeshLab, is a free 3D mesh processing software program; MeshLab, started in late 2005, is an open-source general-purpose system aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small unstructured 3D models that arise in the pipeline of processing of the data coming from 3D scanning. MeshLab is oriented to the management and processing of unstructured large meshes and provides a set of tools for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting these kinds of meshes.
The automatic mesh cleaning filters includes removal of duplicated, unreferenced vertices, non manifold edges and null faces. Remeshing tools support high quality simplification based on quadric error measure, various kinds of subdivision surfaces and two surface reconstruction algorithms from point clouds based on the ball pivoting technique and on the Poisson surface reconstruction approach. For the removal of noise, usually present in acquired surfaces, MeshLab supports various kinds of smoothing filters and tools for curvature analysis and visualization.
MeshLab also includes an interactive direct paint-on-mesh system that allows to interactively change the color of a mesh, to define selections and to directly smooth out noise and small features.
Version 1.1.0 also includes a tool for the registration of multiple range maps based on the Iterative Closest Point algorithm.
MeshLab is available for most platforms, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The system supports input/output in the following formats: PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS and COLLADA.
