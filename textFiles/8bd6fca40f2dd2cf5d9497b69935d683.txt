Nodame Cantabile (のだめカンタービレ ,Nodame Kantābire?) is an ongoing manga by Tomoko Ninomiya. It has been serialized in Japan by Kodansha in the magazine Kiss since 2001 and collected in 21 tankōbon volumes as of August 2008. It is licensed in North America by Del Rey Manga. The series depicts the relationship between two aspiring classical musicians, Megumi "Nodame" Noda and Shinichi Chiaki, as university students and after graduation. It received the 2004 Kodansha Manga Award for best shōjo manga.
The series has been adapted a two different television series: as an award-winning live-action drama that aired in 2006 followed by a sequel television special that aired in January 2008, and as an anime series with a first season broadcast in 2007 and a second season that aired in 2008. A third anime season has been announced for the fall of 2009,[1][2] and two live-action movie sequels to the television drama, with the same actors, have been announced with an anticipated release in 2010.[3] In addition, several soundtrack albums of classical music have been released, as well as three video games.
The manga went on hiatus in Japan in 2008 due to Ninomiya's carpal tunnel syndrome, but returned to irregular serialization starting on 10 March 2009.[4]

[edit] Plot
See also: List of Nodame Cantabile characters
Megumi Noda, or “Nodame” is a piano student at Momogaoka College of Music. An extremely talented pianist who wants to be a kindergarten teacher, she prefers playing by ear rather than reading the music score. She is messy and disorganized, takes baths several days apart and loves to eat, sometimes stealing her friend’s lunchbox when it is filled with delicacies.
Shinichi Chiaki, is Momogaoka’s top student. Born into a musical family, he is talented in piano and violin and has secret ambitions to become a conductor. An arrogant multi-lingual perfectionist who once lived abroad in the music capitals of the world as a young boy (namely Prague), he is trapped in Japan because of his childhood phobia.
They meet by accident. Nodame quickly falls in love, but it takes much longer for Chiaki to even begin to appreciate Nodame’s unusual qualities. Their relationship causes them both to develop and grow. Along the way, they meet some crazy people (like Masumi, Mine, and Stresemann) and make lasting friendships. Because of Nodame, Chiaki gets the opportunity to lead a student orchestra and begins to have a broader appreciation of people's musical abilities. Because of Chiaki, Nodame faces her fears and enters a piano competition. Opportunities open up as both begin taking risks, stretching themselves far more than they ever thought possible.
After graduation, Nodame succeeds in curing Chiaki from his phobia and they both move to Paris where Nodame continues her piano studies at a conservatory while Chiaki starts a professional career as a conductor. In Europe, they encounter new friends and rivals, as well as keep in touch with their friends from Japan.

[edit] Development
Tomoko Ninomiya based the character of Megumi Noda on a real-life counterpart with same name. Ninomiya first learned about the real Noda when the latter, a music college student at the time, posted a photograph of her messy room on a website Ninomiya managed. This inspired her to start a comedy series about a sloppy music student. Ninomiya consults with Noda about musical details, claiming to receive inspiration from her, and thanks Noda in the acknowledgments of every tankōbon volume of Nodame Cantabile.[5][6] Noda, currently a piano teacher in Fukuoka (the home-town of her fictional counterpart), composed the music and co-wrote (with Ninomiya) the lyrics for the "Fart Song" Nodame plays in the first episode of the anime series,[5] and visited Ninomiya upon the birth of her son.[7]
Ninomiya also based the character of James DePriest, the musical director of the fictional Roux-Marlet Orchestra in Paris, on a real-life counterpart with the same name. James DePriest is currently Permanent Conductor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, and conducted the Nodame Orchestra, which provided the music for both the live-action drama and the anime adaptations.

[edit] Media

[edit] Manga
The Nodame Cantabile manga is written and illustrated by Tomoko Ninomiya. It has been serialized by Kodansha in the biweekly josei (aimed at younger adult women) manga magazine Kiss since January 2001, with publication ongoing. The untitled chapters have been collected in 21 tankōbon volumes as of August 2008.[8] It is licensed in North America by Del Rey Manga,[9] in France by Pika Édition,[10] in South Korea by Daiwon C.I.,[11] in Thailand by NED Comics,[12] in Indonesia by Elex Media Komputindo, and in Taiwan by Tong Li Comics. All volume covers feature Nodame with a musical instrument.
Starting in May 2008, Japanese serialization changed from biweekly to monthly because of Ninomiya's pregnancy. Serialization went on hiatus starting October 2008 following the birth of her son and Ninomiya's subsequent diagnosis of having carpal tunnel syndrome, but resumed again with the 10 March 2009 issue of Kiss on a irregular schedule depending on her continued recovery.[4]

[edit] Live-action drama
Nodame Cantabile has been adapted as a live-action television drama broadcast in 11 episodes from 16 October to 25 December 2006 on Fuji TV,[49] covering events up to volume 9 of the manga. This was followed by a four-hour sequel television special, Nodame Cantabile New Year's Special in Europe, adapting further events in the manga after Chiaki and Nodame move to Paris, broadcast on Fuji TV on 4 and 5 January 2008.[50] These were directed by Hideki Takeuchi from scripts by Rin Etou, and starred Hiroshi Tamaki as Shinichi Chiaki and Juri Ueno as Megumi "Nodame" Noda.[49][50]
Music direction was by Daisuke Mogi with original music by Takayuki Hattori, with several works of classical music featured in each episode.[51] The orchestral music was performed by Nodame Orchestra, which consisted of members specially selected for the live-action drama with professional support from the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra. The Orchestra was conducted by James DePriest, Permanent Conductor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Orchestra, who would later have his name and likeness used in the Nodame storyline as the musical director of the fictional Roux-Marlet Orchestra. The opening theme for both the drama series and special was the First movement ("Andante Cantabile") from Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, and the ending theme was Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, both performed by the Nodame Orchestra conducted by Toshiaki Umeda.[49][50]
An episode of PuriGorota: Uchū no Yūjō Daibōken (プリごろ太 宇宙の友情大冒険 ?), the fictional anime series that Nodame watches, was created by J.C.Staff for the drama. The anime was written and directed by Ken'ichi Kasai, the director of the first season of the Nodame Cantabile anime. Segments of the PuriGorota anime were shown during episode 4 of the Nodame Cantabile drama, with the complete anime released as a DVD extra with the Nodame Cantabile anime series.[52]
Two live-action movie sequels to the television drama, with the same actors, have been announced with an anticipated release in 2010.[3] Filming is set to start in May 2009.[53]
The drama is licensed for broadcast in the Philippines on GMA 7.

[edit] Anime
Main article: List of Nodame Cantabile episodes
Nodame Cantabile was also adapted as an anime television series. The anime was produced by J.C.Staff and broadcast on Fuji TV and associated stations in the Noitamina time slot. The first season, called just Nodame Cantabile, was broadcast in 23 episodes from 11 January to 28 June 2007, and the second season, called Nodame Cantabile: Paris Chapter, was broadcast in 11 episodes from 8 October to 18 December 2008. Both seasons were also later aired in Japan on the satellite television network Animax. The first season was directed by Ken'ichi Kasai (the director of the Honey and Clover anime) and the second season by Chiaki Kon, and starred Ayako Kawasumi as Megumi "Nodame" Noda and Tomokazu Seki as Shinichi Chiaki.[54][55] A third anime season has been announced for the fall of 2009.[1][2]
On February 6, 2009, the series received its English language television premiere on Animax Asia across its networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia, airing the series with its original Japanese audio and English subtitles.[56][54]
Music director for both seasons was Suguru Matsutani.[54][55] As with the live-action drama, several works of classical music were featured in each episode,[57] performed by the Nodame Orchestra. The opening theme of season one was "Allegro Cantabile" by Suemitsu & The Suemith, and the ending themes were "Konna ni Chikaku de..." by Crystal Kay (episodes 1–12), "Sagittarius" by Suemitsu & the Nodame Orchestra (episodes 13–22), and "Allegro Cantabile" by Suemitsu & The Suemith (episode 23).[54] The opening theme for the second season was "Sky High" by The Gospellers (with melody taken from the Third movement ("Allegro Scherzando") of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2), and the ending theme was "Tokyo et Paris" (東京 et Paris ?, lit. "Tokyo and Paris") by Emiri Miyamoto x solita (with variations on the theme from Ravel's Boléro).[55]
The first season was released on 8 DVDs between April and November 2008.[58] A box set was released in February 2008 with an additional 15-minute original video animation (OVA), taking place between episodes 8 and 9. The series has been licensed in Russia[citation needed] and South Korea. The first DVD of the second season was released on 24 December 2008, with additional DVDs scheduled to be released monthly.

[edit] Games
Three Nodame Cantabile games have been released in Japan:

Nodame Cantabile for Nintendo DS, released 19 April 2007 by Namco Bandai Games.[60][61]
Nodame Cantabile for PlayStation 2, released 19 July 2007 by Banpresto.[62]
Nodame Cantabile: Dream Orchestra (のだめカンタービレ ドリーム☆オーケストラ ?) for Wii console, released 27 December 2007 by Namco Bandai Games.[63]


[edit] Reception
The manga of Nodame Cantabile received the 2004 Kodansha Manga Award for shōjo manga,[64] and was a jury recommendation at both the 2005 and 2008 Japan Media Arts Festivals.[65][66] It was a finalist for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2005 and 2006,[67][68] but did not win. In 2006, the English translation was named by the New York Public Library as one of the Books for the Teen Age.[69] The series is a perennial best-seller in Japan: the first 16 volumes sold over 19 million copies as of January 2007,[70][71] and the series sold 2.8 million copies in 2008, making it the 8th best-selling manga series in Japan that year.[72] Volume 17 was the third best-selling manga on the Oricon charts for 2007,[73] and volumes 20 and 21 were the 6th and 7th best-selling manga on the Oricon charts for 2008, respectively, selling 1.2 million copies each.[74] According to an Oricon survey men and women aged 10–40, Nodame Cantabile was the second "most interesting" manga series published during 2008.[75][76] The series and its associated music albums are credited with increasing sales of classical music in Japan.[77]
The English translation of Nodame Cantabile has been praised for its quirky, interesting characters,[78] sense of humor,[79][80] and clean art.[81][82] Dirk Deppey in The Comics Journal praised Ninomiya's storytelling, saying she "has a solid sense of when to accentuate the highs and lows with just the right note, and understands that one can only do this by not hitting such notes very often", resulting in "an understated soap opera" that is "a seamless and enjoyable storytelling experience."[83] Reviewers have called Ninomiya's character development subtle,[81] while noting it is the character interactions that drive the story,[84][85] and that "each character has a real and lasting effect on others."[81] Reviewers also cite Ninomiya's ability to depict "scenes of people playing music that no one can hear" and her sense of humor as factors in the series' appeal.[86][78][87][79] Ninomiya has been criticized for not handling transitions between storylines well,[78][88] for sometimes letting the characters derail the story,[87] and for art and backgrounds that are sometimes too plain.[81][89][90]
The live-action drama received the 2007 Japanese Drama Academy Awards for Best Drama, Best Lead Actress (Juri Ueno), Best Direction (Hideki Takeuchi), Best Music (Takayuki Hattori), and Best Title Song;[71] the show was also recognized overseas as Best Miniseries at the 2nd Seoul Drama Festival.[citation needed] Juri Ueno also was named Best Newcomer at the Élan d'or Awards for her performance,[citation needed] and the next year was named Best Actress at the International Drama Festival in Tokyo Awards for reprising her role as Nodame in the television special.[91] The first soundtrack album for the drama, Nodame Orchestra LIVE!, reached number seven on the Oricon album chart, breaking the record for highest ranked classical music album.[59]
The drama has been praised by reviewers for, especially, the acting.[92]
The opening episode of the anime series broke the record for audience share for its time-slot.[93][94] The first DVD volume debuted at number 3 on the Oricon chart for anime the week it went on sale.[95]
Although the anime has not been licensed in English, it has still received notice from English reviewers, who praised the character development and chemistry, the balance between drama and comedy, voice acting, and especially the music—both the performances and how it was presented.[96][97] Reviewers did complain that the visual design of some secondary characters were too similar.[96]
In 2006, a cafe based on Nodame Cantabile opened in Harajuku, Tokyo, including live music from the live-action drama and sets from the show.[98]
