From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Drunken Sailor is a famous traditional sea shanty also known as What Shall We Do with a Drunken Sailor?. It is now rarely called by its other name Sailor’s Holiday.[citation needed]
The theme of the song is quite self-explanatory. It begins with the question, "What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?" (Or sometimes "What do you do," etc.) Each verse thereafter suggests a method of sobering—or castigating, or simply abusing—the sailor.

[edit] History
Drunken Sailor was a work song often sung when raising a sail or raising the anchor, which is the reference for “Up She Rises” in the song’s chorus. Such songs were the only ones allowed in the Royal Navy. Most often, only two or three verses were sung but verses were often added until the task was completed.

[edit] Origins
The air was taken from a traditional Irish dance and march tune, "Oró Sé do Bheatha 'Bhaile" (Translated as "Óró, you are welcome home") originally in dorian mode. The same tune has also been used for other songs, possibly Ten Little Injuns, according to William E. Studwell in the "Americana Song Reader" (1997, p. 74)
The music was first reproduced in printed form in 1824–25 in Cole’s Selection of Favourite Cotillions published in Baltimore. However, the lyrics were first published in 1891 under the title "What to do with a Drunken Sailor?". Another version appears in The Shanty Book, Part I, Sailor Shanties, by Richard Runciman Terry, categorised as a "Windlass and Capstan" shanty. He says of it: "Although mostly used for windlass or capstan, Sir Walter Runciman tells me that he frequently sang to it for 'hand-over-hand' hauling. Whall gives it on page 107 under the title 'Early in the morning.' It is one of the few shanties that were sung in quick time."

[edit] Lyrics
There are many different versions of the lyrics, and possibly thousands of individual verses.
Note that "early" is generally pronounced as "earl-eye."
