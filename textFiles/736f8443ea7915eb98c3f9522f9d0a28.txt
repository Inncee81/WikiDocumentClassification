It has been suggested that Precarity (Euromayday) and Precarity (Social Christianity) be merged into this article or section. (Discuss)


The word precarity literally meant "precariousness", but is now used to mean existence without predictability or security, affecting material or psychological welfare. It has been specifically applied to intermittent employment, sometimes plus a precarious existence.

For a sociological view of labor conditions, see Precarious work.
For a social Christianity view, see Precarity (Social Christianity)
For the Eurocentric syndicalist view see Precarity (Euromayday)
