Apache Portable Runtime

Developed by
Apache Software Foundation


Latest release
1.3.3 / 2008-08-16; 233 days ago


Written in
C/C++


Operating system
Cross-platform


Type
Development Library

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is a supporting library for the Apache web server. It provides a set of APIs that map to the underlying operating system. Where the OS doesn't support a particular function, APR will provide a replacement. Thus, the APR can be used to make a program truly portable across platforms.
APR was originally a part of Apache, but has now been spun off into a separate project of the Apache Software Foundation, and is used by other applications to achieve platform independence.
The range of platform-independent functionality provided by APR includes:

Memory allocation and memory pool functionality
Atomic operations
Dynamic library handling
File I/O
Command argument parsing
Locking
Hash tables and arrays
Mmap functionality
Network sockets and protocols
Thread, process and mutex functionality
Shared memory functionality
Time routines
User and group ID services

[edit] Installation
A very simple tutorial that explains how to compile and install Apache Portable Runtime (apr) on Linux can be found here.

[edit] Similar projects

Glib provides similar functionality. It supports many more data structures and OS-independent functions, but fewer IPC-related functions (local and global locking, dynamic loading, or shared memory management are not provided).
NSPR is a cross-platform abstraction library used by the Mozilla project. It is used by another subproject of Mozilla XPFE to provide cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) functionality.
Adaptive Communication Environment (ACE) is an object-oriented library written in C++ similar in functionality to APR. It is widely deployed in commercial products[1].
commonc++ is a cross-platform C++ class library for systems programming, with much of the same functionality as APR.
WxWidgets is an object-oriented cross-platform GUI library that also provides abstraction classes for database communication, IPC and networking functionality.
Qt is a cross-platform application development framework with similar features and can also be used for GUI development.
