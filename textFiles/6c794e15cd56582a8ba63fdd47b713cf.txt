David "Elsewhere" Bernal


Born
August 2, 1979 (1979-08-02) (age 29)


Occupation
Liquid Dancer


David "Elsewhere" Bernal (born August 2, 1979) is an illusionary dancer from Santa Ana, California. He became known through a viral video clip (Often titled Kolla2001) of himself dancing to Kraftwerk's song Expo 2000[1] recorded at the Asian Pacific Islander talent show Kollaboration in 2001.
The clip showcased Bernal's characteristic take on the contemporary dance styles of popping[citation needed] and abstract waving. Performances of these dances were rare at the time, and the clip became very popular when it circulated on the internet — so popular that in November 2006, The Viral Factory, a viral marketing company, collated page-impression figures from websites such as YouTube and Google Videos. They determined that, as of November 2006, this video had been viewed over 200 million times, making it the 8th most viewed video.[2]
Bernal was later hired to participate in advertisements for Heineken (dancing to "Cobrastyle" by the Teddybears), Volkswagen, iPod, 7-Eleven Slurpee, Pepsi and Doritos. He also made a cameo appearance in the movie You Got Served and TV performances including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.[3]
Computer graphics technology were used in several of the commercials Bernal took part in, superimposing others' faces (old, young, male, female) onto his body so that they appeared to dance like him. In one of the most popular, in Jan 2005 for the Volkswagen Golf GTI, Gene Kelly's head was superimposed onto Bernal's body in a re-enactment of "Singin' in the Rain" remixed by Manchester group Mint Royale.[4]
Bernal also filmed and edited a large amount of the documentary video titled Detours. The video featured experimental dance styles focused primarily on four dancers, Midus, Kujo, Rawbzilla, and Elsewhere. While focusing much of the video on the four primary dancers, dozens of others were also featured in the video. The project has since ended and videos can be bought through various websites.
On August 8, 2007, Bernal and his dancing were featured in a segment of the inaugural episode of ABC's new video-clip program, i-Caught.
