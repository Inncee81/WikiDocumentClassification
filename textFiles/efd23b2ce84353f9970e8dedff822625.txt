From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Christianity portal



List of Christian denominations (or Denominations self-identified as Christian) ordered by historical and doctrinal relationships. (See also: Christianity; Christian denominations).
Some groups are large (e.g. Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans or Baptists), while others are just a few small churches, and in most cases the relative size is not evident in this list. Also, modern movements such as Fundamentalist Christianity, Pietism, Evangelicalism, Pentecostalism and the Holiness movement sometimes cross denominational lines, or in some cases create new denominations out of two or more continuing groups, (as is the case for many United and uniting churches, for example). Such subtleties and complexities are not clearly depicted here. Additionally, some groups viewed by non-adherents as denominational actively resist being called a "denomination" and do not have any formal denominational structure, authority, or record-keeping beyond the local congregation; several groups within Restorationism fall into this category.

Note: This is not a complete list, but aims to provide a comprehensible overview of the diversity among denominations of Christianity. As there are reported to be over 38,000 Christian denominations, [1] many of which cannot be verified to be significant, only those denominations with Wikipedia articles will be listed in order to ensure that all entries on this list are notable and verifiable.


Note: Between denominations, theologians, and comparative religionists there are considerable disagreements about which groups can be properly called Christian, disagreements arising primarily from doctrinal differences between groups. For the purpose of simplicity, this list is intended to reflect the self-understanding of each denomination. Explanations of different opinions concerning their status as Christian denominations can be found at their respective articles.






Major divisions within Christianity. The different width of the lines (thickest for "Protestantism" and thinnest for "Oriental Orthodox" and "Nestorians") is without objective significance.

[edit] Catholicism
Main article: Catholicism
These are the churches which claim continuity (based upon Apostolic Succession) with the church before separation into Greek or Eastern and Latin or Western. (Lutheran churches have also identified themselves as catholic on the basis of continuity in doctrine with the Early Church.)

[edit] Roman Catholic Church
Main article: Roman Catholic Church

[edit] Latin Rite
The Latin Rite or Church[2] is the largest and most widely known of the 22 Rites of the Catholic Church. In the past, Catholics in France and Germany have claimed a measure of ecclesial independence from Rome (see Febronianism, Gallicanism), but not to the extent of forming Churches distinct from the Roman Catholic Church as a whole (as happened with the Church of England) or even from the Latin Church.

[edit] Eastern Catholic Churches
Main article: Eastern Catholic Churches
All of the following are particular churches of the Catholic Church. They are all in communion with the Bishop of Rome and acknowledge his claim of universal jurisdiction and authority.

[edit] Oriental Orthodox Church
Main article: Oriental Orthodox Church
Oriental Orthodoxy comprises those Christians who did not accept the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451). Other denominations often erroneously label these churches "Monophysite", however, as the Oriental Orthodox do not adhere to the teachings of Eutyches, they themselves reject this label, preferring the term Miaphysite.

[edit] Assyrian Church of the East
Main article: Assyrian Church of the East
The Assyrian Church of the East is said to have been formed by St Thomas. The Church did not attend the Council of Ephesus (AD 431). It is incorrectly referred to as Nestorianism; Assyrian Christians do not consider themselves Nestorians, and recent Christological agreements with the Catholic and some of the Orthodox churches have resolved this debate permanently, clearing the way for union.

[edit] Latter Day Saints
Main articles: Latter Day Saint movement and Mormonism
Most Latter Day Saint denominations are derived from the Church of Christ established by Joseph Smith, Jr. in 1830. The majority of "Prairie Saint" denominations were established after the death of Smith by the remnants of the saints who did not go west with Brigham Young. The Rocky Mountain denominations are various sects who broke from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after its abandonment of polygamy in 1890. Other denominations are defined by either a belief in Joseph Smith as a prophet, or acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. Mormonism is generally considered part of restorationism, believing that Smith restored the original Church of Christ to the Earth. Some Latter Day Saint denominations are regarded by other Christians as being nontrinitarian, but generally do not accept that label themselves, in contrast to the groups labelled "nontrinitarian" below.
