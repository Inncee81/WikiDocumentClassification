Project Management Professional is properly expressed as the credential PMP. The credentialing agency is the Project Management Institute ([1] PMI). This credential is obtained by gaining a certification in project management through the completion of PMI-certified solid project management working experience and examination. PMP training and examination material comes from the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (or PMBOK), the Fourth Edition of which was published in December 2008. Most exam questions relate to PMI's project quality standards, which are documented in the PMBOK. The PMP credential undergoes rigorous validation by ISO, and the PMBOK guide is widely regarded as the industry standard for Project Management. It has been adopted as the single standard for project management by agencies such as NASA.

1. CAPM Certified Associate in Project Management: This certification is obtained after passing the CAPM Exam
2. PMP Project Management Professional: This certification is obtained after passing the PMP Exam

4. PMI RMP PMI Risk Management Professional: This certification is obtained after passing the PMI-RMP Exam
