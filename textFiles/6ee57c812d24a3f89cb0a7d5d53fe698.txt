[edit] Early life
Greenfield graduated from New York University in 1989, earning a degree in Cultural Studies. In 1995, he enlisted in the United States Army's reserve component Special Operations Command as a Psychological operations specialist, holding MOS 37F and eventually achieving the grade of Sergeant.

[edit] Career
After leaving the Army, Greenfield took up work in the then-nascent field of information architecture for the World Wide Web, holding a succession of prominent positions culminating in employment at the Tokyo office of Razorfish, where he was head of the information architecture department. He is currently best known for his 2006 book Everyware: The dawning age of ubiquitous computing (ISBN 0-321-38401-6), which has been called "groundbreaking" by Bruce Sterling: "One puts it down with a strange conviction that web-designers have transcended geekdom and achieved Zen soulfulness."
He currently co-teaches a class called Urban Computing at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program with Kevin Slavin of New York design practice area/code.
Greenfield had earlier proposed an "open-source constitution for post-national states" called the Minimal Compact, although he appears to have done little work on this project in recent years. He is also credited with having coined the word "moblog" to describe the practice of publishing to the World Wide Web from mobile devices, and having organised a conference devoted to discussing this practice in Tokyo in mid-2003.
He is generally considered to be a thought leader in the information architecture and user experience professions. Greenfield maintains a personal Web site called Speedbird.

[edit] Personal life
He lives in Helsinki, Finland, with his wife, artist Nurri Kim where he aspires to curate vintage and antique bollards.
