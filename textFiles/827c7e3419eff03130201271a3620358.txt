User experience design is a subset of the field of experience design which pertains to the creation of the architecture and interaction models which impact a user's perception of a device or system. The scope of the field is directed at affecting "all aspects of the user’s interaction with the product: how it is perceived, learned, and used." [1]

[edit] The user experience
User experience design, most often abbreviated UX, but sometimes UE, is a term used to describe the overarching experience a person has as a result of their interactions with a particular product or service, its delivery, and related artifacts, according to their design. As with its related term, User Interface Design, prefixing "User" associates it primarily (though not exclusively) with digital media, especially interactive software.

[edit] The designers
This field has its roots in human factors and ergonomics, a field that since the late 1940s has been focusing on the interaction between human users, machines and the contextual environments to design systems that address the user's experience.

[edit] The design
User experience design incorporates most or all of the above disciplines to positively impact the overall user experience a person has with a particular interactive system, and its provider. User experience design most frequently defines a sequence of interactions between a user (individual person) and a system, designed to meet or support user needs and goals, primarily, while also satisfying systems requirements and organizational objectives.

[edit] Benefits
User experience design is integrated into software development and other forms of application development in order to inform feature requirements and interaction plans based upon the user's goals.
