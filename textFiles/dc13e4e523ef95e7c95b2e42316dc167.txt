Jajah is a VoIP (Voice over IP) provider, founded by Austrians Roman Scharf and Daniel Mattes in 2005. The Jajah headquarters are located in Mountain View, CA, USA, and Luxembourg. Jajah maintains a development centre in Israel.
Jajah's primary service, Jajah Web, takes an approach called web-activated telephony, using VoIP to connect traditional phones (landline or mobile). Calls are made without download or user-installed software, and in most cases at rates lower than those of traditional phone companies or even free of charge.[citation needed]

[edit] History

Jajah was founded in 2005 by Roman Scharf and Daniel Mattes.


The first beta version of the Jajah Webphone, a proprietary peer-to-peer internet telephony (VoIP) softphone, was released in July 2005.


February 8, 2006 Jajah Web version 1.0 (build 1708) released.


September 12, 2006 Jajah Web version 1.1 (build 1714) including conference calls


September 27, 2007 Jajah launches a solution named "Jajah Buttons" which enables small businesses or individuals to embed buttons on their Web sites to allow others to contact them by phone using the company's Internet telephony platform. Jajah Buttons caused a notable controversy when eBay removed and banned such buttons from auction listings in eBay's site, presumably to protect revenues from its own VOIP solution provided by Skype. [1][2]


November 19, 2007 Jajah launches the Jajah Direct service, which enables users to make phone calls without having to be next to a computer. Jajah Direct is a phone service that allows you to make long-distance or international calls by calling a local number, it works with every phone. There are no free calls using this service.[citation needed]


April 28, 2008 Jajah provides its proprietary telephony infrastructure, payment processing, and customer care to Yahoo! Messenger users using the platform for receiving calls from the PSTN network, or for making calls to land lines and mobile phones.[citation needed]


[edit] Jajah Web
Jajah Web connects existing traditional landline or mobile phones with calls that are set up via Jajah's Web site. Jajah claims that their service works with any standard web browser.[citation needed]

[edit] Jajah Direct
Jajah Direct assigns local numbers to international contacts.

[edit] Jajah Free Global Calling
Jajah launched a service offering free calls globally on June 28, 2006.[citation needed] The service is limited to specified geographic areas, and Jajah has also adopted a fair use policy which limits the amount of free Jajah calls.
Calls between registered Jajah users are free of charge for landline and mobile calls within the USA, Canada, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and apply also for landline calls to and within most European countries as well as Argentina, Australia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico City, New Zealand, Venezuela and Zambia.
A limitation is that scheduled calls and conference calls cannot be free. In addition, Jajah's FAQ pages says that Jajah asks its customers to pay from time to time (every six weeks).[3] If you choose not to pay, Jajah will start charging as it would for a normal call. It should also be noted that the lowest amount that can be credited to your account (every six weeks, if you want to retain the free minutes) is $10.
