Cause of death

John S. Kanzius (March 1, 1944 – February 18, 2009), was an American inventor, radio and TV engineer, one-time station owner and ham radio operator (Call Sign K3TUP) from Erie, Pennsylvania. He invented a method that has the potential to treat cancer, inspired by his own battle with the deadly disease. [1] [2] He also demonstrated a device that can "burn salt water". Both effects involve the use of his radio frequency transmitter.
Kanzius, an autodidact, stated that he was motivated to research the subject of cancer treatment by his own experiences undergoing chemotherapy for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[3][4]

[edit] Cancer therapy
Kanzius RF Therapy is an experimental cancer treatment that employs a combination of either gold or carbon nanoparticles and radio waves to heat and destroy cancer cells without damaging healthy cells.[5][6][7]
The specific absorption rate for radio waves by living tissue in the proposed wavelengths and intensity levels is very low. Metals absorb this energy much more efficiently than tissue through dielectric heating; Richard Smalley has suggested that carbon nanotubes could be used to similar purpose.[8] If nanoparticles were to be preferentially bound to cancer sites, cancer cells could be destroyed or induced into apoptosis while leaving healthy tissue relatively unharmed.[9] This preferential targeting represents a major technical challenge. According to a presentation by Steven Curley, the types of cancer potentially treatable using Kanzius RF therapy include essentially all forms of cancer.[10]
Kanzius built a prototype Kanzius RF device in his home, and formed Therm Med., LLC to test and market his inventions.[11][12] The device was successfully tested at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 2005.[2] As of 2007-04-23, preliminary research using the device at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston[13][14][15] and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center[11] has shown early promise. If federal approval is granted, testing on human patients may follow.[9][16][4]

[edit] Water-related discovery
Later in 2007, Kanzius announced that the same radio frequency transmitter can also be used to burn hydrogen electrolyzed from salt water.[14] [17] The discovery was made accidentally while he was researching the use of radio waves for desalination. Kanzius said that "In this case we weren't looking for energy, we were looking for something that might do desalinization. The more we tried desalinization, the more heat we produced, until we got fire".[17] Kanzius admitted that this process could not be considered an energy source, as more energy is used to produce the RF signal than can be obtained from the burning gas and stated in July 2007 that he never claimed his discovery would replace oil, asserting only that his discovery was "thought provoking."[18] The details of the process are still unreleased pending the issuance of a patent.[18]
Kanzius proposed that the flame is produced by burning of hydrogen and oxygen, released from the water by radio waves "forcing together" the "normally separated" hydrogen and oxygen in the water, a process he calls "reunification". [18] In water (H2O), hydrogen is covalently bonded to oxygen, and thus the process must "reunite" pairs of hydrogen atoms and pairs of oxygen atoms, releasing dihydrogen (H2) and dioxygen (O2). The energy from the radio waves is absorbed by the water and splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen which then react together to reform the water and re-release the energy and form a flame. In other words, the process turns radio energy into chemical energy, which then turns to heat and light energy, but does not "take energy from water". Rather, energy is put into the water in order to break it up into its components, which now may combust. The water torch, a form of oxyhydrogen torch, is an earlier example of the process of breaking down water and then recombining oxygen and hydrogen to release heat and light energy.
The red flame and non explosive form of burning[19] suggest that other chemicals are involved in the fire, and if the claims are true, may be the chlorine released from the melted salt (NaCl).
Nevertheless, this discovery may be a clean way to break down water into its elements and perhaps a cheaper way than electrolysis which in most forms produces toxic output from chemical reactions with the electrodes, or otherwise is produced with platinum electrodes, which are very expensive. It is difficult to compare the processes, when no chemical, physical or numeric details are actually known, except the claims that RF heats up the water, breaks it down into its elements and that it then combusts.
Kanzius' experiment has been confirmed by Rustum Roy, a materials scientist at Pennsylvania State University, in a demonstration before the Material Science faculty, using Kanzius' RF transceiver[20], which Kanzius had brought to the lab for the day.[14] On his website, Roy writes: "It is clear that Mr. Kanzius has demonstrated the ability to dissociate aqueous solutions of sodium chloride at normal sea water concentrations into hydrogen and oxygen."[20][14][17]
According to Roy, "The salt water isn't burning per se, despite appearances. The radio frequencies act to weaken the bonds between the elements that make up salt water, releasing the hydrogen. Once ignited, the hydrogen will burn as long as it is exposed to the frequencies."[21] The temperature and flame color varies with water solutions and concentrations.[21]
Hydrogen gas burns with oxygen, while releasing heat, and turning into water - which has a lower energy content than the original two elements. In order to reproduce hydrogen and oxygen gas, external energy must be introduced into the low-energy water (compound). Philip Ball, a consulting editor at Nature and author of "H2O: A Biography of Water", is highly critical of any theory of water as a fuel, both in general, and specifically as an alternative to traditional fuel sources. Although he says that Kanzius' discovery itself needs to be verified through careful experiments, he states that "water is not a fuel" and "[w]ater does not burn". Ball also states that according to the laws of thermodynamics, it is "impossible to extract energy by producing hydrogen from water and then burning it, as this would be a basis for a perpetual motion machine." He is critical of lack of inquiry in the media reports about bogus science.[22] Ball writes "Here, however (for what it is worth) is the definitive verdict of thermodynamics: water is not a fuel."

[edit] Death
John Kanzius died from pneumonia on February 18, 2009, at a hospital near his winter home near Sanibel, Florida. The pneumonia developed as complication after two recent rounds of chemotherapy.[23][24]
