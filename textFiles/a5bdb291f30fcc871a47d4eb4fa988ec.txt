A paternoster or paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like.

[edit] History
First built in 1884 by Londoner J. E. Hall as the Cyclic Elevator, the name paternoster ("Our Father", the first two words of the Lord's Prayer in Latin) was originally applied to the device because the elevator is in the form of a loop and is thus similar to rosary beads used as an aid in reciting the Lord's prayer.
Paternosters were popular throughout the first half of the 20th century as they could carry more passengers than ordinary elevators. They were more common in continental Europe, especially in public buildings, than in the United Kingdom. However, a number of United Kingdom, multi-storey, university buildings were built in the early 1960s with paternoster lifts: they included buildings at Aston University; Birmingham University's Gisbert Kapp building (the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering), the Muirhead Tower, and the University Library); Leicester University's Attenborough Building; Leeds University's Roger Stevens building, now closed, Salford University's tower block, now demolished; Sheffield University's Arts Tower, De Montfort University's Fletcher Building (now replaced with high speed lifts,) and James Went Building (now demolished) Oxford University's Psychology/Zoology building and Thom Building, and Newcastle University. Until the late 1980's St. Thomas' Hospital, Westminster had a paternoster for staff use, while one administrative building at AEE Winfrith had one until the late 1990s.
Today, in many countries the construction of new paternosters is no longer allowed because of the high danger of accidents (people tripping or falling over when trying to enter or alight). In 1989, the paternoster in Newcastle University's Claremont Tower was taken out of service after a passenger undertaking an up-and-over journey became caught in the drive chain, necessitating a rescue by the Fire Service. A conventional elevator was subsequently installed in its place. This accident led to an 18-month close-down of all UK paternosters for a safety review, during which additional safety devices were fitted.
In April 2006, Hitachi announced plans for a modern paternoster-style elevator with computer-controlled cars and normal elevator doors to alleviate safety concerns.[1][2] [3]

[edit] In Popular Culture

David Lodge's comic novel, Changing Places, includes a chase scene involving a paternoster.
In one of the hospital scenes from the movie The Omen, the nun conversing with Robert Thorn leaves by way of a paternoster.
In the novelization of Metropolis, worker 11811 operates the machine controlling a paternoster in the New Tower of Babel; inspired by the machine's name, he continusously mutters a disturbed version of the Lord's Prayer.

Munich - Kaufhof am Marienplatz had a paternoster working for the staff. The building was erected in 1972, so it is one of the last ones ever in Germany, and there is no reason it should not be in operation anymore.

Paternoster at the Albert Sloman library at the University of Essex



Paternoster lifts continue to operate in the Albert Sloman library at the University of Essex.
The Arts Tower at the University of Sheffield contains a 38-car paternoster.[4] The building is a teaching block and not specifically open to the public, but the paternoster can be seen from the front door. It is the tallest in the UK.
Attenborough Tower at the University of Leicester.
A seven floor Paternoster survives in E block at the Ericsson (formerly Marconi) site in Beeston, Nottinghamshire. Employees were banned from going around the bottom or over the top following an incident a few years ago, when abuse caused by a group of visitors shaking the car had caused the car to get stuck at the bottom. The lift has been out of action since November 2007, and is unlikely to be put back into service.
Rolls-Royce's seven storey tower block on Victory Road in Derby.
Staff in the main ward building of Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, Middlesex, have access to a paternoster in the main ward block. This is regularly maintained and is frequently used by staff instead of the nearby conventional lifts due to its speed in transferring between adjacent floors.
The Dental Hospital in Birmingham has one which used to be for staff use, until maintenance costs forced its closure in 2007.
In Scotland, a working paternoster serves seven floors of the Pontecorvo Building (former Department of Genetics) at the University of Glasgow. The building is not open to the public. A paternoster was installed there on construction, in 1966–67 (by architects Basil Spence & Partners) because each floor has a small area and it was anticipated that staff and students would make many short journeys. This expectation has been fulfilled, and the paternoster is considered to have been a very valuable device. Occupants of the Pontecorvo Building are currently being relocated to allow its demolition.
There is a paternoster at Technology House, the headquarters of Boxclever, in Bedford, which was switched off on February 11, 2008 for health and safety reasons
There is a paternoster at Thomson House, an office building at Birchwood Park near Warrington. Although covered over during re-refurbishments in 2005 due to maintenance costs, the paternoster is still operable if uncovered.
There is a disused paternoster at Marks & Spencer in Liverpool. The lift was used until the late 1990s and was covered up due to health and safety concerns and rising maintenance costs. It is still fully in place behind access panels.
There is also a disused paternoster in Marks & Spencer Pantheon, London, which is also covered up.
