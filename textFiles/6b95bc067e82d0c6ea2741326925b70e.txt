Sark (French: Sercq; Sercquiais: Sèr) is a small island in the southwestern English Channel. It is one of the Channel Islands, is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and as such is a British crown dependency. It has a population of about 600. Sark's main industries are tourism, crafts and finance. Sark has an area of two square miles (5.45 km²), and was the last European territory to abolish what some called classic feudalism, in 2008.

[edit] Geography
Sark consists of two main parts, Greater Sark, located at about 49° 25' N x 2° 22' W, and Little Sark to the south. They are connected by a narrow isthmus called La Coupée which is just nine feet (3 m) wide with a drop of 300 feet (91 m) on each side. Protective railings were erected in 1900; before then, children would crawl across on their hands and knees to avoid being blown over the edge. There is a narrow concrete road covering the entirety of the isthmus, built in 1945 by German prisoners of war under the direction of the Royal Engineers. Due to isolation, the inhabitants of Little Sark had their own distinct form of Sercquiais, the native Norman dialect of the island.[citation needed]




La Coupée is the narrow isthmus which links Greater and Little Sark 49°25.25′N 2°21.97′W﻿ / ﻿49.42083°N 2.36617°W﻿ / 49.42083; -2.36617


The highest point on Sark is 374 feet (114 m) above sea-level. A windmill, dated 1571, is found there, the sails of which were removed during World War I. The location is also the highest point in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. Little Sark had a number of mines accessing a source of galena.[1] At Port Gorey, the ruins of silver mines[2] may be seen. Off the south end of Little Sark are the Venus Pool and the Adonis Pool, both natural swimming pools whose waters are refreshed at high tide.
The whole island is extensively penetrated at sea level by natural cave formations, some of which are only safely accessible at low tide.
Sark also claims jurisdiction over the island of Brecqhou, only a few hundred feet west of Greater Sark. It is a private island that is not open to visitors. Since 1993 Brecqhou has been owned by David Barclay, one of the Barclay brothers, co-owners of The Daily Telegraph. They contest Sark's control over the island.

[edit] History

Sark in relation to the other islands of Bailiwick of Guernsey


The Veneti tribe almost certainly possessed the island in ancient times. These people were subdued by the Roman Empire in around 56 BC and the island would have been annexed to the empire. Following the end of the Roman Empire and before the middle of the tenth century Sark had probably been an appendage of one of the Breton speaking kingdoms. After around 933 it became a part of the Duchy of Normandy which became united with the Crown of England after 1066. In the thirteenth century, Sark was used as a base of operations by the French pirate Eustace the Monk after he served King John of England. Although populated by monastic communities in the medieval period, Sark was uninhabited in the 16th century and used as a refuge and raiding base by Channel pirates. Helier de Carteret, Seigneur of St. Ouen in Jersey, received a charter from Queen Elizabeth I to colonise Sark with 40 families from St. Ouen on condition that he maintained the island free of pirates.
An attempt by the newly settled families to endow themselves with a constitution under a bailiff, as in Jersey, was put down by the authorities of Guernsey who resented any attempt to wrest Sark from their bailiwick.[citation needed]
In 1849, the incumbent Seigneur, Pierre Carey le Pelley was forced to sell the seigneurie of Sark to Marie Collings, daughter and heiress of local privateer John Allaire, for £6,000. In 1844, desperate for funds to continue the operation of the silver mine on the island, le Pelley's father Ernest le Pelley had obtained crown permission to mortgage the Fief of Sark to Allaire; but the mine company went bankrupt, and Pierre was unable to keep up the mortgage payments.[3]
During World War II, the island was occupied by German forces from 1940–1945, as were the other Channel Islands, and was the site of a British raid called Operation Basalt.

[edit] Recent history

[edit] One-person invasion attempt
In August 1990 an unemployed French nuclear physicist named André Gardes attempted a singlehanded invasion of Sark, armed with a semi-automatic weapon. The night Gardes arrived he put up signs declaring his intention to take over the island the following day at noon. He was arrested while sitting on a bench, changing the gun's magazine and waiting for noon to arrive, by the island's volunteer Constable.[4][5]

[edit] Transition to elected government
Main article: Sark general election, 2008
On 4 July 2007 Sark began to dismantle its feudal system on the premise that this was necessary to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. The majority of the island's legislature could be elected by 2009.[6] On 16 January 2008 and 21 February 2008, the Chief Pleas approved a law which introduces a 30-member chamber, with 28 elected members and retaining only two unelected members. On 9 April 2008, the Privy Council approved the Sark law reforms,[7] and the first elections under the new law were held in December 2008 and the new chamber will first convene in January 2009.[8][9][10]

[edit] Politics
Sark was considered the last feudal state in Europe. Formally, the Seigneur holds it as a fiefdom from the Queen, reenfeoffing the landowners on the island with their respective parcels. The political consequences of this construction were abolished in recent years, particularly in the reform of the legislative body, Chief Pleas, which took place in 2008.

[edit] Seigneur
Main article: List of Seigneurs of Sark
John Michael Beaumont is the current and twenty-second Seigneur of Sark, inheriting the position in 1974. He lives at La Seigneurie.
The Seigneur of Sark was, prior to the constitutional reforms of 2008, the head of the feudal government of the Isle of Sark (in the case of a woman, the title was Dame). Many of the laws, particularly those related to inheritance and the rule of the Seigneur, had changed little since they were enacted in 1565 under Queen Elizabeth I. The Seigneur retained the sole right on the island to keep pigeons and was the only person allowed to keep an unspayed bitch.[11][4]

[edit] Tenants




The Seigneurie 49°26.4′N 2°21.7′W﻿ / ﻿49.44°N 2.3617°W﻿ / 49.44; -2.3617


Pursuant to the royal letters patent, the Seigneur was to keep the island inhabited by at least 40 armed men. Therefore, from his lands, 39 parcels, each sufficient for one family, were subdivided and granted to settlers, the Tenants. Later, some of these parcels were dismembered, and parts of the Seigneurial land were sold, creating more parcels.
Originally each head of a parcel-holding family had the right to vote in Chief Pleas, but in 1604 this right was restricted to the 39 original tenements required by the Letters Patent, the so-called Quarantaine Tenements (quarantaine: French for a group of forty). The newer parcels mostly did not have the obligation to bear arms. In 1611 the dismemberment of tenements was forbidden, but the order was not immediately followed.
In Sark, the word tenant is used (and often pronounced as in French) in the sense of feudal landholder rather than the common English meaning of lessee. Originally, the word referred to any landowner, but today it is mostly used for a holder of one of the Quarantaine Tenements.

[edit] Chief Pleas
Chief Pleas (French: Chefs Plaids; Sercquiais: Cheurs Pliaids) is the parliament of Sark. Until this decade, it consisted of the Tenants, and 12 Deputies of the people as the only representation of the majority, an office introduced in 1922. The Seigneur and the Seneschal (who presides) are also members of Chief Pleas. The Prévôt, the Greffier, and the Treasurer also attend but are not members; the Treasurer may address Chief Pleas on matters of taxation and finance.
The executive officers on the island are:

The Seneschal (President of Chief Pleas and Chief Judge) and the Deputy Seneschal
The Prevôt (Sheriff of the Court and of Chief Pleas) and the Deputy Prevôt
The Greffier (Clerk) and the Deputy Greffier
The Treasurer (Finances)
The Constable (the senior policeman and administration) and the Vingtenier (the junior policeman)

Seneschal, Prevôt, Greffier and Treasurer are chosen by the Seigneur; Constable and Vingtenier are elected by Chief Pleas.
Since 2000, Chief Pleas has been working on its own reform, responding to internal and international pressures. On 8 March 2006 by a vote of 25–15 Chief Pleas voted for a new legislature of the Seigneur, the Seneschal, 14 elected landowners and 14 elected non-landowners.[12] But it was made plain that this option was not on the table. Offered two options for reform involving an elected legislature, one fully elected, one with a number of seats reserved for elected Tenants, 56% of the inhabitants expressed a preference in a totally elected legislature. [13] Following the poll, Chief Pleas voted on 4 October 2006 to replace the 12 Deputies and 40 Tenants in Chief Pleas by 28 Conseillers elected by universal adult suffrage.[14] This decision was suspended in January 2007 when it was pointed out to Chief Pleas that the 56% versus 44% majority achieved in the opinion poll did not achieve the 80% majority required for the constitutional change. The decision was replaced by the proposal that Chief Pleas should consist of 16 Tenants and 12 Conseillers both elected by universal adult suffrage from 2008-2012 and that a binding referendum should then decide whether this composition should be kept or replaced by 28 Conseillers.[15] This proposal was rejected by the Privy Council and the 28 Conseiller option was reinstated in February 2008 and accepted by Privy Council in April 2008. [16]
In 2003, Chief Pleas voted to vary the longstanding ban on divorce in the island by extending to the Royal Court of Guernsey power to grant divorces.[citation needed]
The list of current Officers of the Island of Sark:

Seneschal - Lieutenant Colonel Reginald John Guille
Deputy Seneschal - Jeremy La Trobe-Bateman
Prevôt - Alfred William John Adams
Deputy Prevôt - Kevin Neil Adams (son of Alfred William John Adams)
Greffier - Trevor John Hamon
Deputy Greffier - John Hamon (father of Trevor John Hamon)
Treasurer - Mrs Wendy Kiernan
Constable - Alan Leslie George Blythe
Vingtenier - Caragh Couldridge


[edit] Clameur de Haro
Among the old laws of the Channel Islands is the old Norman custom of the Clameur de Haro. Using this legal device, a person can obtain immediate cessation of any action he considers to be an infringement of his rights. At the scene, he must, in front of witnesses, recite the Lord's Prayer in French and cry out "Haro, Haro, Haro! À mon aide mon Prince, on me fait tort!"[11] ("Haro, Haro, Haro! To my aid, my Prince! I am being wronged!") It should then be registered with the Greffe Office within 24 hours. All actions against the person must then cease until the matter is heard by the Court. The last Clameur recorded on Sark was raised in June 1970 to prevent the construction of a garden wall.[4]

[edit] Sercquiais
Main article: Sercquiais
Sercquiais (Sarkese, or sometimes called Sark-French) is a dialect of the Norman language still spoken by older inhabitants of the island.[17] Its use has declined in recent years due to a large influx of people who have moved to Sark.[18]

[edit] Education
Sark generally follows the education system of England and Wales.
Sark has one school, the Sark School, which takes residents from the ages of 5 to 15.[19] Pupils wishing to obtain a GCSE or A-level qualification usually finish their education in Guernsey or Jersey.

[edit] Transportation
The island is a car-free zone where the only vehicles allowed are horse-drawn vehicles, bicycles, tractors, and battery-powered buggies or motorised bicycles for elderly or disabled people. Passengers and goods arriving by ferry from Guernsey are transported from the wharf by tractor-pulled vehicles.
There is no airport on Sark and overflight of Sark is prohibited by the Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Guernsey) Regulations 1985 (Guernsey 1985/21). The closest airports are the Guernsey Airport and the Jersey Airport.

[edit] Religion




St. Peter's Anglican church


In common with the other Channel Islands, Sark lies in the Anglican diocese of Winchester.
Sark has an Anglican church (St. Peter's, built 1820) and a Methodist[20] church. John Wesley first proposed a mission to Sark in 1787. Jean de Quetteville of Jersey subsequently began preaching there, initially in a cottage at Le Clos à Geon and then at various houses around Sark. Preachers from Guernsey visited regularly, and in 1796, land was donated by Jean Vaudin, leader of the Methodist community in Sark, for the construction of a chapel, which Jean de Quetteville dedicated in 1797.[21] In the mid-1800s there was a small Plymouth Brethren assembly. Its most notable member was the classicist William Kelly (1821–1906). Kelly was then the tutor to the Seigneur's children.
Supported by the evidence of the names of the tenements of La Moinerie and La Moinerie de Haut, it is believed[22] that the Seigneurie was constructed on the site of the monastery of Saint Magloire. Magloire had been Samson of Dol's successor as bishop of Dol, but retired and founded a monastery in Sark where he died in the late 6th century. According to the vita of Magloire, the monastery housed 62 monks and a school for the instruction of the sons of noble families from the Cotentin. Magloire's relics were venerated at the monastery until the mid-9th century when Viking raids rendered Sark unsafe and the monks departed for Jersey, taking the relics with them.

[edit] Sport
Participation in sport tends towards individual sports rather than team sports, but the population supports a cricket team, a rugby team and a football team.[23] Sark competes in the biannual Island Games in which the Sark national football team has participated. The annual Sark to Jersey Rowing Race is contested by teams from both bailiwicks.[24]

[edit] Literature
There are many examples of literature taking Sark as an inspiration or setting.

[edit] Norman literature
Although there is no record of literature about Sark in Sercquiais, Guernésiais and Jèrriais literature has included writing about Sark; for example by such authors as Edwin John Luce[25], Thomas Grut[26], George F. Le Feuvre[27], and Denys Corbet.[28]

[edit] English literature

Swinburne wrote a poem, In Sark, which appears in the collection A Century of Roundels.
John Oxenham wrote Carette Of Sark (1907) and his 1910 novel A Maid Of The Silver Sea uses the mines of Little Sark as its setting.
The novel Mr Pye by Mervyn Peake, best known for the Gormenghast series, has been adapted for radio and television, the latter (starring Derek Jacobi and Judy Parfitt, and featuring a number of islanders) being filmed in Sark.
Dame of Sark, the memoirs of the 21st Seigneur Sibyl Mary Hathaway, who was present during the German occupation, were made into a play and television drama of the same name.[29]
The novel Appointment with Venus by Jerrard Tickell is set on the fictional island of Armorel, which is presumed to be based on Sark. The 1951 film of the book used Sark as a principal location.
Sarah Caudwell's The Sirens Sang of Murder (1989) is partly set in Sark.


[edit] French literature
Maurice Leblanc's novel L'Île aux Trente Cercueils (translated in English as The Secret of Sarek) features an island called Sarek, off the coast of Brittany, and bears obvious similarities to Sark. In the story, gentleman-thief Arsène Lupin rescues Véronique d'Hergemont from a local superstition requiring the death of thirty women to appease vengeful spirits.

[edit] Television
Sark featured in the 6th episode of the fourth series of The New Statesman, The Irresistible Rise of Alan B'Stard and also in the Jersey-based television detective series Bergerac.
Part of the seventh episode of the second series of World War II television drama Enemy at the Door takes place in Sark. La Coupée features in a number of scenes.
Sark, and in particular the Gouliot Caves, features in episode 8 of series 3 of the BBC television series Coast.
