The following is a list of films and television series often described as film noirs.
Film noir is a loosely defined category that refers primarily to stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize moral ambiguity and sexual motivations. The original attempt at a definition—by French cineastes Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton in 1955—described film noir as "oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel." In 2005, American author Charles Pappas declared film noir to be "the language of losers...always about the same things: Sex. Violence. Money." Decades of debate over what constitutes film noir have resulted in no critical consensus. Thus, the applicability of the term film noir to characterize any given movie is subjective. The term was used neither in the American movie industry nor in American film criticism during most of the 1940s and 1950s, the period now regarded as the classic era of film noir. There is often a substantial difference of opinion concerning whether specific films should be categorized as noir or not; notable films from noir's classic period for which this is the case include Casablanca (1942) and the Alfred Hitchcock films Rebecca (1940), Suspicion (1941), and Spellbound (1945).
The relevance of the term to any movies (and television programs) made before or after the classic period of the 1940s and 1950s is debated as well. The terms used here to describe various periods and variations of film noir are not definitive. They are used as an aid to navigating the list rather than as a critical argument.
As befits the above description, the following list is composed largely of U.S. productions. Movies described as noir made outside the United States are also listed, without any pretense to comprehensiveness. Multinational productions are identified only by the lead country, determined first by the primary language of the film, next by the nationality of the director.
