From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

An Ahnentafel (or Ahnenreihe) is a genealogical numbering system that allows one to list a person's ancestors in a particular order. It is also known as: the Eytzinger Method, for Michael Eytzinger, the German historian who first published the principles of the system in 1590[1]; the Sosa Method, named for Jerónimo (Jérôme) de Sosa, the Spanish genealogist who popularized the numbering system in his work Noticia de la gran casa de los marqueses de Villafranca in 1676[2]; and the Sosa-Stradonitz Method, for Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz, the genealogist and son of Friedrich August Kekulé, who published his interpretation of Sosa's method in his Ahnentafel-atlas in 1898.[3]
Ahnentafel is a construct used in genealogy to display a person's ancestry compactly, without the need for a diagram such as a family tree, which is particularly useful in situations where one may be restricted to using plain text, for example in e-mails or newsgroup articles. The term Ahnentafel is a loan word from the German language, however its German equivalent is Ahnenliste. In German Ahnentafel means a genealogical chart showing the ancestors of one person in the form of a binary tree. An Ahnentafel chart may also be called a Kekulé after Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz.
An Ahnentafel is effectively a method for storing a binary tree in an array by listing the nodes in level-order. The subject of the Ahnentafel is listed as #1, their father as #2 and their mother as #3, then their grandparents as #4 to #7, and so on back through the generations. In this scheme, any person's father has double that person's number, and a person's mother has double the person's number plus one. Apart from #1, who can be male or female, all even-numbered persons are male, and all odd-numbered persons are female. Using this knowledge, you can find out some things without having to compile a list.

[edit] How to find the Ahnentafel number, knowing the relation





This article contains instructions, advice, or how-to content. The purpose of Wikipedia is to present facts, not to train. Please help improve this article either by rewriting the how-to content or by moving it to Wikiversity or Wikibooks.


To find out what someone's number would be without compiling a list, you must first trace how they relate back to the person of interest, meaning you must record that they are their father's mother's mother's father's father's... Once you have done that, you can use two methods.

[edit] First method
Use the knowledge that a father's number will be twice the subject's number, or a mother's will be twice plus one, and just multiply and add to 1 accordingly. For instance, we can find out what number Electress Sophia of Hanover would be on an Ahnentafel of Peter Mark Andrew Phillips. Sophia is Peter's mother's mother's father's father's father's mother's father's father's father's father's father's mother. So, we multiply and add.

1*2+1=3

3*2+1=7

7*2=14

14*2=28

28*2=56

56*2+1=113

113*2=226

226*2=452

452*2=904

904*2=1808

1808*2=3616

3616*2+1=7233























So, if we were to make a list of ancestry for Peter Phillips, Electress Sophia would be #7233.

[edit] Second method (binary representation)
This is an elegant and concise way to visualize the genealogical chain between the subject and the ancestor.

1. Write down the digit "1", which represents the subject, and, writing from left to right, write "0" for each "father" and "1" for each "mother" in the relation, ending with the ancestor of interest. The result will be the binary representation of the ancestor's Ahnentafel number. Let's try with the Sophia example, translating the chain of relations into a chain of digits.






Sophia = "Peter's mother's mother's father's father's father's mother's father's father's father's father's father's mother"
Sophia = 1110001000001






2. If needed, convert the Ahnentafel number from its binary to its decimal form. A conversion tool might prove handy.






Sophia = 1110001000001 (binary)
Sophia = 7233 (decimal)






[edit] How to find the relation, knowing the Ahnentafel number
We can also work backwards and find what the relation is from the number.

[edit] First method

1. You start out by seeing if the number is odd or even.
2. If it is odd, the last part of the relation is "mother," and you subtract 1 and divide by 2.
3. If it is even, the last part is "father," and you divide by 2.
4. Repeat steps 2-3, and build back from the last word.
5. Once you get to 1, you are done.

So, let's see an example. On an Ahnentafel of HRH Prince William of Wales, Mr John Wark is number 116. We follow the steps:


116/2=58
58/2=29
29-1=28/2=14
14/2=7
7-1=6/2=3
3-1=2/2=1


father
father
mother
father
mother
mother


We reverse that, and we get that #116, Mr John Wark, is Prince William's mother's mother's father's mother's father's father.

[edit] Second method (binary representation)

1. Convert the Ahnentafel number from decimal to binary.






Mr John Wark = 116 (decimal)
Mr John Wark = 1110100 (binary)






2. Replace the leftmost "1" with the subject's name and replace each following "0" and "1" with "father" and "mother" respectively.






Mr John Wark = 1110100
Mr John Wark = "Prince William's mother's mother's father's mother's father's father"

[edit] Documents called "Ahnentafel"




Ahnentafel of Sigmund Christoph von Waldburg-Zeil-Trauchburg






Ahnentafel to be used as an Ariernachweis


European nobility took pride in displaying their descent. In the German language, the term "Ahnentafel" may refer to a list of coats of arms and names of one's ancestors, even when it does not follow the numbered tabular representation given above. In this case the German "Tafel" is taken literally to be a physical "display board" instead of an abstract scheme.
In Nazi Germany the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service required to prove non-Jewish ancestry in the terms of an Ariernachweis (Aryan certificate). This certificate could take the form of entries in the permanent Ahnenpass (that was sorted according to the Ahnentafel numbering system) or entries in a singular Arierschein (Aryan attestation) that was titled "Ahnentafel".
