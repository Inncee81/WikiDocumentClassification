Main article: ISO 3166-1
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are two-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166-1, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), to represent countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest. They are the most widely used of the country codes published by ISO, and are used most prominently for the Internet's country code top-level domains (with a few exceptions).[1] They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.

[edit] Uses and applications
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used in different environments and are also part of other standards. In some cases they are not perfectly implemented.

[edit] Perfect implementations
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are used in the following standards:

ISO 3166-2 — Country subdivision code[2]
ISO 3901 — International Standard Recording Code (ISRC)[3]
ISO 4217 — Currency code[4]
ISO 6166 — International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN)[5]
ISO 9362 — Bank Identifier Codes (BIC), or also known as SWIFT codes[6]
ISO 13616 — International Bank Account Number (IBAN)[7]
UN/LOCODE — United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations, implemented by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe[8]


[edit] Imperfect implementations
Starting in 1985, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes have been used in the Domain Name System as country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority currently assigns the ccTLDs mostly following the alpha-2 codes, but with a few exceptions.[9] For example, the United Kingdom, whose alpha-2 code is GB, uses .uk instead of .gb as its ccTLD (UK is currently exceptionally reserved on the request of the United Kingdom).
The WIPO coding standard ST.3 is based on ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, but includes a number of additional codes for international intellectual property organizations.[10] For these additional codes, see the section Codes currently agreed not to use.
The European Commission uses ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes with two exceptions: EL (not GR) is used to represent Greece, and UK (not GB) is used to represent the United Kingdom.[11] This notwithstanding, the Official Journal of the European Communities specified that GB and GR be used to represent the United Kingdom and Greece respectively.[12]
The United Nations uses a combination of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, along with codes that pre-date the creation of ISO 3166, for international vehicle registration codes, the codes on the oval stickers used to identify foreign road vehicles.[13] For some of these additional codes, see the section Indeterminate reservations.
IETF language tags are also partially derived from ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.[14]

[edit] User-assigned code elements
User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use them in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-2 codes can be user-assigned: AA, QM to QZ, XA to XZ, and ZZ. For example:

UN/LOCODE assigns XZ to represent Installations in International Waters.[8]
ISO 4217 uses codes starting with X for non-country-specific currencies, such as XCD for the East Caribbean dollar.[4]


[edit] Reserved code elements
Reserved code elements are codes which have recently become obsolete, or are in use for some applications in conjunction with the official ISO 3166-1 codes. The ISO 3166/MA therefore reserves them, so that they are not used for new official codes during a limited or indeterminate period of time, thereby avoiding any transitional problems or conflicts between the ISO 3166-1 standard and those applications. The list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 reserved code elements is divided into the following four categories.

[edit] Exceptional reservations
Exceptionally reserved code elements are codes reserved permanently at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and international organizations because they are needed for particular purposes. The ISO 3166/MA only authorizes their use for the particular purpose for which they were established. The following alpha-2 codes are currently exceptionally reserved:


Alpha-2

[edit] Transitional reservations
Transitional reserved code elements are codes which were withdrawn from ISO 3166-1, but maintained during a transitional period of at least five years, for the sake of users who still need to refer to the former entity or whose systems have not yet been updated to refer to the new codes that may have replaced them. The following alpha-2 codes are currently transitionally reserved:


Alpha-2
Formerly used country name
Date of reservation

[edit] Indeterminate reservations
Indeterminately reserved code elements are codes used to identify vehicles under the 1949 and 1968 United Nations Road Traffic Conventions. These codes differ from those used in ISO 3166-1. The ISO 3166/MA hopes that these codes will eventually be phased out and that ISO 3166-1 codes will be used instead; but in the meantime they are reserved, to avoid conflicts between ISO 3166-1 and the Conventions, and to facilitate any transition from the Convention codes to ISO 3166-1 codes. However, they can be reassigned at any time by the ISO 3166/MA. The following alpha-2 codes are currently indeterminately reserved:

[edit] Codes currently agreed not to use
In addition, the ISO 3166/MA has undertaken, for the time being, not to use the following alpha-2 codes from WIPO Standard ST.3; however, these codes are not classified as either exceptional, transitional, or indeterminate reservations, since they represent international intellectual property organizations, instead of the names of countries, territories, or areas of geographical interest:


Alpha-2
Organization name


AP
African Regional Intellectual Property Organization


BX
Benelux Trademarks and Design Offices


EF
Union of Countries under the European Community Patent Convention


EM
European Trademark Office


EP
European Patent Organization


EV
Eurasian Patent Organization


GC
Patent Office of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)


IB
International Bureau of WIPO


OA
African Intellectual Property Organization


WO
World Intellectual Property Organization


WIPO Standard ST.3 actually uses EA to represent the Eurasian Patent Organization. However, The ISO 3166/MA has stated it cannot guarantee to reserve EA from use, since it is already used to represent Ceuta and Melilla for customs purposes (EA is currently exceptionally reserved). The ISO 3166/MA proposed in 1995 that EV be used by WIPO to represent the Eurasian Patent Organization; however, this request was not honoured by WIPO.

[edit] Withdrawn codes
Besides the codes currently transitionally reserved, and FX and SU (currently exceptionally reserved), the following alpha-2 codes have also been withdrawn from ISO 3166-1:
