A circle is a simple shape of Euclidean geometry consisting of those points in a plane which are the same distance from a given point called the centre. The common distance of the points of a circle from its center is called its radius. A diameter is a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and which passes through the centre of the circle. The length of a diameter is twice the length of the radius. A circle is never a polygon because it has no sides or vertices
Circles are simple closed curves which divide the plane into two regions, an interior and an exterior. In everyday use the term "circle" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure (known as the perimeter) or to the whole figure including its interior, but in strict technical usage "circle" refers to the perimeter while the interior of the circle is called a disk. The circumference of a circle is the perimeter of the circle (especially when referring to its length).
A circle is a special ellipse in which the two foci are coincident. Circles are conic sections attained when a right circular cone is intersected with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone.

[edit] Further terminology







Chord, secant, tangent, and diameter.








Arc, sector, and segment





A chord of a circle is a line segment whose two endpoints lie on the circle. The diameter, passing through the circle's centre, is the largest chord in a circle. A tangent to a circle is a straight line that touches the circle at a single point. A secant is an extended chord: a straight line cutting the circle at two points.
An arc of a circle is any connected part of the circle's circumference. A sector is a region bounded by two radii and an arc lying between the radii, and a segment is a region bounded by a chord and an arc lying between the chord's endpoints.

[edit] History




The compass in this 13th century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of Creation. Notice also the circular shape of the halo


The circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. It is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern civilization possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry and calculus.
Early science, particularly geometry and Astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles.
Some highlights in the history of the circle are:

1700 BC – The Rhind papyrus gives a method to find the area of a circular field. The result corresponds to 256/81 as an approximate value of π.[1]
300 BC – Book 3 of Euclid's Elements deals with the properties of circles.
1880 – Lindemann proves that π is transcendental, effectively settling the millennia-old problem of squaring the circle.[2]


[edit] Analytic results

[edit] Length of circumference
For more details on this topic, see Pi.
The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is π (pi), a constant that takes the same value (approximately 3.1416) for all circles. Thus the length of the circumference (c) is related to the radius (r) by



or equivalently to the diameter (d) by




[edit] Area enclosed




Area of the circle = π × area of the shaded square


Main article: Area of a disk
The area enclosed by a circle is π multiplied by the radius squared:



Equivalently, denoting diameter by d,



that is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length d).
The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.

[edit] Equation




Circle of radius r = 1, center (a, b) = (1.2, -0.5)


In an x-y Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with center (a, b) and radius r is the set of all points (x, y) such that



This equation of the circle follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the diagram to the right, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length x − a and y − b. If the circle is centered at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to



The equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as




where t is a parametric variable, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from the origin to (x, y) makes with the x-axis. Alternatively, in stereographic coordinates, the circle has a parametrization




In homogeneous coordinates each conic section with equation of a circle is of the form



It can be proven that a conic section is a circle if and only if the point I(1: i: 0) and J(1: −i: 0) lie on the conic section. These points are called the circular points at infinity.
In polar coordinates the equation of a circle is



where a is the radius of the circle, r0 is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and φ is the anticlockwise angle from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle. For a circle centred at the origin, this reduces to simply r = a.
In the complex plane, a circle with a center at c and radius (r) has the equation . Since , the slightly generalized equation  for real p, q and complex g is sometimes called a generalised circle. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalized circle is either a (true) circle or a line.

[edit] Tangent lines
Main article: Tangent lines to circles
The tangent line through a point P on a circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through P. The equation of the tangent line to a circle of radius r centered at the origin at the point (x1, y1) is



Hence, the slope of a circle at (x1, y1) is given by:



More generally, the slope at a point (x, y) on the circle (x − a)2 + (y − b)2 = r2, i.e., the circle centered at (a, b) with radius r units, is given by



provided that .

[edit] Properties

The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See Isoperimetric inequality.)
The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the center forms a line of reflection symmetry and it has rotational symmetry around the center for every angle. Its symmetry group is the orthogonal group O(2,R). The group of rotations alone is the circle group T.
All circles are similar.

A circle's circumference and radius are proportional.
The area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional.

The constants of proportionality are 2π and π, respectively.




The circle centered at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle.

Thought of as a great circle of the unit sphere, it becomes the Riemannian circle.


Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the center of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See circumcircle.


[edit] Chord properties

Chords are equidistant from the center of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.
The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector:

A perpendicular line from the center of a circle bisects the chord.
The line segment (circular segment) through the center bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.


If a central angle and an inscribed angle of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.
If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.
If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplemental.

For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.


An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle.
The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.


[edit] Sagitta properties

The sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the circumference of the circle.
Given the length y of a chord, and the length x of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle which will fit around the two lines:








Another proof of this result which relies only on two chord properties given above is as follows. Given a chord of length y and with sagitta of length x, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the “missing” part of the diameter is (2r − x) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that (2r − x)x = (y/2)². Solving for r, we find the required result.

[edit] Tangent properties

The line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius is a tangent to the circle.
A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the center of the circle.
Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.


[edit] Theorems




Secant-secant theorem


See also: Power of a point

The chord theorem states that if two chords, CD and EB, intersect at A, then CA×DA = EA×BA.
If a tangent from an external point D meets the circle at C and a secant from the external point D meets the circle at G and E respectively, then DC2 = DG×DE. (Tangent-secant theorem.)
If two secants, DG and DE, also cut the circle at H and F respectively, then DH×DG = DF×DE. (Corollary of the tangent-secant theorem.)
The angle between a tangent and chord is equal to the subtended angle on the opposite side of the chord. (Tangent chord property.)
If the angle subtended by the chord at the center is 90 degrees then l = √2 × r, where l is the length of the chord and r is the radius of the circle.
If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle A is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (DE and BC). This is the secant-secant theorem.


[edit] Inscribed angles




Inscribed angle theorem


An inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180 degrees).


[edit] Apollonius circle




Apollonius' definition of a circle: d1/d2 = constant.


Apollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in plane having a constant ratio of distances to two fixed foci, A and B. That circle is sometimes said to be drawn about two points[3].
The proof is as follows. A line segment PC bisects the interior angle APB, since the segments are similar:



Analogously, a line segment PD bisects the corresponding exterior angle. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to , the angle CPD is exactly , i.e., a right angle. The set of points P that form a right angle with a given line segment CD form a circle, of which CD is the diameter.

[edit] Cross-ratios
A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If A, B, and C are as above, then the Apollonius circle for these three points is the collection of points P for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:

| [A,B;C,P] | = 1.

Stated another way, P is a point on the Apollonius circle if and only if the cross-ratio [A,B;C,P] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.

[edit] Generalized circles
See also: Generalized circle
If C is the midpoint of the segment AB, then the collection of points P satisfying the Apollonius condition

   (1)

is not a circle, but rather a line.
Thus, if A, B, and C are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points P satisfying (1) is called a generalized circle. It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is generalized circle of infinite radius.
