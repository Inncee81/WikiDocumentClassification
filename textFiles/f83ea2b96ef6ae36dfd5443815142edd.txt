[edit] Background



This section requires expansion.


Laporte studied Chinese History at Yale University before dropping out in his junior year to pursue his career in radio broadcasting,[3] where his early radio names were Dave Allen and Dan Hayes[4]. He began his association with computers with his first home PC, an Atari 400.[5] He operated one of the first Macintosh-only bulletin board systems, MacQueue, from 1985 to 1988.[6] Leo also helped out with the starting of CNET Networks.[citation needed]

[edit] Television and radio


New Media Expo 2008


Justine Ezarik, Sarah Austin, Amber MacArthur, and Laporte (2008-08-15)



Gary Vaynerchuk, Ezarik and Laporte



Laporte has created, hosted, and contributed to a number of technology-related broadcasting projects. He created and co-hosted Dvorak On Computers in January 1991 (co-hosted with computer pundit John Dvorak), and hosted Laporte On Computers on KGO Radio and KSFO in San Francisco. In addition, Laporte also hosted Internet! on PBS, and The Personal Computing Show on CNBC. In 1997 he earned an Emmy Award for his work on MSNBC's The Site, a daily Monday through Saturday hour-long newsmagazine he helped create and appeared on in the role of a computer-generated character named Dev Null.
In 1998, he created and co-hosted The Screen Savers and the original version of Call for Help on the cable and satellite network ZDTV (later TechTV). Laporte left The Screen Savers in 2004 due to a dispute with TechTV's then-outgoing owner, Vulcan Ventures, over stock ownership. His contract ended on March 31, and his absence from The Screen Savers on April 1 was originally believed to be an April Fool's Day joke. Laporte has also pursued acting, playing Uncle Charlie in the movie Phoenix Rising.[7]
Laporte was the host of the daily television show The Lab with Leo Laporte, recorded in Vancouver, Canada. On March 6, 2008, Laporte confirmed on net@Nite #46 that The Lab with Leo Laporte had been canceled by Rogers Communications. The HOW TO Channel refused to air the remaining episodes after it was announced the show had been canceled.[8][9]
The program was formerly known as Call for Help when it was recorded in Toronto and, prior to that, in the U.S. The series aired on G4techTV Canada, in Australia on the HOW TO Channel, on several of Canada's Citytv affiliates, and on Google Video some weeks after initial broadcast.
He also hosts a weekend technology-oriented talk radio program show titled Leo Laporte: The Tech Guy. The show, once an exclusive to KFI AM 640 (Los Angeles), is now syndicated on more than 60 North American radio stations through Premiere Radio Networks, and on XM Satellite Radio. Laporte appears semi-regularly on Showbiz Tonight,[10] Live with Regis and Kelly,[11] World News Now, and briefly with Bill Handel on Friday mornings on KFI. He has also been a guest technology expert on numerous talk radio programs in local markets across the U.S. and Canada.

[edit] Books
Laporte has authored a number of technology-oriented books such as 101 Computer Answers You Need to Know, Leo Laporte's 2005 Gadget Guide, Leo Laporte's Guide to TiVo, Leo Laporte's Guide to Mac OS X Tiger and Leo Laporte's PC Help Desk. Laporte has also published a yearly series of technology almanacs: Leo Laporte's Technology Almanac and Poor Leo's Computer Almanac. Laporte's latest and last book is Leo Laporte's 2006 Technology Almanac.
Throughout his career, he has contributed to a number of periodicals such as BYTE, InfoWorld, and MacUser. Laporte announced in October, 2006 that he will not renew his contract with Que Publishing and has retired from publishing his long series of books. He said, "Writing books is hard work and, love-starved groupies aside, the compensations are scant. I’ll put my energies into something I love to do, talking for a living."[12]
In 2008, Laporte did the voice narration for the fable The True History of Little Golden-hood by Andrew Lang which was made available through Audible.

[edit] Netcasting




Amber MacArthur and Leo Laporte


Laporte currently owns and operates a netcast network, TWiT.tv. The name is derived from the network's award winning, flagship podcast This WEEK in TECH, or TWiT, which is hosted by Laporte along with a rotating panel of guests usually made up of several other former TechTV employees. This show remains one of the most popular podcasts on iTunes and other podcast subscription services, as evidenced by winning an award at the November 2005 Podcasting Expo in California for the year's best podcast and by its over 280,000 weekly downloads.
Laporte prefers to call his shows "netcasts," saying "I've never liked the word podcast. It causes confusion … people have told me that they can't listen to my shows because they 'don't own an iPod' … I propose the word 'netcast.' It's a little clearer that these are broadcasts over the Internet. It's catchy and even kind of a pun."[13] With the addition of TWiT.tv's live video feed, the shows are no longer audio-only.
Some of his other "netcasts" include Security Now! with Steve Gibson, MacBreak and MacBreak Weekly, both hosted in a fashion similar to TWiT, The Daily Giz Wiz with Dick DeBartolo, Munchcast with Cammy Blackstone, Windows Weekly with Paul Thurrott, FLOSS Weekly, net@nite with Amber MacArthur, and Roz Rows The Pacific (launched June 3, 2008).

[edit] TWiT Live
Leo now hosts an online tech-oriented videostream TWiT Live.[14] It is currently broadcast through Stickam, Ustream, as well as an audio only stream, and a BitGravity stream beginning April 1 2009, and is live every day from about 2-7 EST, excluding Monday and Friday. A complete, official programming schedule can be found on Google Calendar.
On July 11, 2008 he did a special 24 hour show about the release of the iPhone 3G. It received 271,733 views, with a peak of 10,001 viewers.[15]
