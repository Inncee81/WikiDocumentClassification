Metadesign (or meta-design) is an emerging conceptual framework aimed at defining and creating social, economic and technical infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative design can take place. As a methodology, its aim is to nurture emergence of the previously unthinkable as possibilities or prospects through the collaboration of designers within interdisciplinarity 'metadesign' teams.

[edit] Background
The Greek word ‘meta’ originally meant ‘beside’ or ‘after’ but is now also used to imply the possibility of change or transformation, including self-transformation. Metadesign can therefore allude to a possible design practice that (re)designs itself (see Maturana and Varela's term autopoiesis). The idea of Metadesign acknowledges that future uses and problems cannot be completely anticipated at design time. Aristotle's influential theory of design defined it by saying that the 'cause' of design was its final state. This teleological perspective is similar to the orthodox idea of an economic payback at the point of sale, rather than successive stages when the product could be seen to achieve high levels of perceived value, throughout the whole design cycle. Some supporters of metadesign hope that it will to extend the traditional notion of system design beyond the original development of a system by allowing users to become co-designers.
Motivated by the environmentalist and ethical concerns described above, some researchers are working towards the establishment of a metadesign profession. For one thing, most designers are trained - and then paid - to work as specialists with a specific focus. The problem with specialism is that it makes it more difficult for individuals to think 'outside their box'. The current professions of design are unable to re-design (consciously) their working practices. This is because, at the professional level, they are currently unable to attain a high level of strategic power. For example, whereas many designers may be personally conscious of the ecological context, the divisive pressures of the prevailing economic system have proved almost insuperable. Metadesign emphasizes certain explicit relations that are designed to operate at the level of living-style. This is why an effective metadesign profession, or practice needs to be a consensual co-design practice that is entrepreneurial and entredonneurial on many levels. It suggests that metadesign would offer a manifold ethical space. In this respect, related approaches include what Koestler (1967) called holarchy, or what John Chris Jones called 'creative democracy'.

[edit] Ten Attributes of Metadesign
1 - Auspicious (focuses on the affirmative, optimistic and serendipitous)
2 - Indescribable (seeks to make the unthinkable possible)
3 - Self-steering (adapts by re-languaging its own working language)
4 - Fractal (making complex systems navigable through pattern-familiarity)
5 - Holistic (delivers complex, comprehensive and self-aware outcomes)
6 - Synergistic (cultivates and harnesses team complementarities)
7 - Synergy-seeking (aspires to a beneficial ‘synergies-of-synergies’)
8 - Opportunity-Making (uncovers unexpected potential for other systems)
9 - Integrated innovations (creates whole systems by interdependent parts)
10 - Paradigm-shifting (seeks to make human culture more ecological)
