Justin Hall, 2008


Justin Hall (born December 16, 1974 in Chicago, Illinois), is an American freelance journalist who is best known as a pioneer blogger (internet-based diarist), and for writing reviews from game conferences such as E3 as well as the Tokyo Game Show.
He graduated in Chicago's Francis W. Parker High School in 1993, and in 1994, while a student at Swarthmore College, started his web-based diary Justin's Links from the Underground, which offered one of the earliest guided tours of the web.[1] Over time, the site came to focus on Hall's life in intimate detail. In December, 2004, New York Times Magazine referred to him as "the founding father of personal blogging."[2] Presently, Hall lives in San Francisco, California, where he recently moved from Los Angeles, California. He graduated from the USC Interactive Media Division. He is also a regular attendee of the Indie Game Jam. Hall's current project PMOG can be found at www.gamelayers.com
