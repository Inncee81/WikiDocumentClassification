ScummVM 0.13.0's graphical user interface with the "modern" skin

ScummVM Team


Latest release
0.13.0 / 2009-02-28; 40 days ago


Operating system
Cross-platform


Type

ScummVM is a collection of game engine recreations. Originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the SCUMM system (the VM in the name stands for virtual machine), it now also supports a variety of non-SCUMM games by companies like Revolution Software and Adventure Soft.
ScummVM is a reimplementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting languages such games used to describe the game world rather than emulating the hardware the games ran on; as such, ScummVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released.
ScummVM was originally written by Ludvig Strigeus.[1] Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, ScummVM is free software.

It has also been ported to console systems. Less mainstream personal computer ports include those to AmigaOS, Atari/FreeMiNT, Haiku/BeOS/ZETA, MorphOS and OS/2.

[edit] Official
A variety of game consoles have official ports; ScummVM has been ported to gaming machines such as the PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, Wii and GameCube[3], and to handheld consoles including the GP2X, Nintendo DS and the PlayStation Portable. Handheld computer platforms supported include Palm OS/Tapwave Zodiac, Symbian OS (UIQ platform, Nokia 60, 80 and Nokia 7710/90 phone series), Nokia's Internet Tablet OS (used by the Nokia 770, N800 and N810), Apple's iPhone[4] and Windows Mobile.

[edit] Development
ScummVM was a participant in the Google Summer of Code 2007 and 2008.[6]
The following games have been added to ScummVM's Subversion tree. The engines may be in various states of operation.


The Big Red Adventure
Cruise for a Corpse
Discworld
Igor: Objective Uikokahonia
Operation Stealth
Orion Burger
Return to Zork
The Manhole
Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2
Rodney's Funscreen


Another World was integrated for a short period of time causing a brief but heated discussion, ranging from emotional to purely technical aspects. Some felt it was more of an action game than an adventure game, others worried that ScummVM, being geared towards bitmapped graphics, really was not the ideal platform for a polygon-based game. The discussion was rendered moot when the raw project was officially closed by its author, at the request of Eric Chahi, the original developer of Another World, who was developing his own Windows-based update.[citation needed]
Operation Stealth and Future Wars support was added by integrating another stand-alone recreation of their engine: cinE.[7]

[edit] AGI engine addition
In 2006 the Adventure Game Interpreter engine was added. It is based on Sarien code, an AGI interpreter that was outdated and buggy in some ways, which has been solved in the new ScummVM engine. The Sarien project stopped its development, continuing the development into ScummVM's AGI engine.[8]
TrollVM has also been integrated into ScummVM adding support for three pre-AGI games: Mickey's Space Adventure, Troll's Tale, and Winnie the Pooh and the Hundred Acre Wood. [9].

[edit] Game releases
During the development cycle leading up to the 0.5.0 release on August 2 2003, game manufacturer Revolution Software not only helped ScummVM developers add support for their adventure Beneath a Steel Sky by supplying them with the original source code, but also decided to release both the CD and the floppy version of the game as freeware[10], available for download on the ScummVM website.[11] A few months later, the developers of Flight of the Amazon Queen made it freely available in much the same way.
The cut scenes from the supported Broken Sword games were encoded in the Smacker video format when originally released, which requires specialised software to be decoded. RAD Game Tools is unwilling to release the specifications of the older versions of the Smacker format and has asked the ScummVM team to not reverse engineer it. Revolution Software therefore allowed re-encoded versions of these cut scenes to be downloaded for free from the ScummVM website.[citation needed]
