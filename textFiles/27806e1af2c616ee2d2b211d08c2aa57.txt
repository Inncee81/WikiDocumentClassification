[edit] Biography

[edit] Early life
Gaiman's family is of Polish Jewish origins; his great-grandfather emigrated from Antwerp before 1914[9] and his grandfather eventually settled in the Hampshire city of Portsmouth and established a chain of grocery stores.[10] His father, David Bernard Gaiman,[11][12] worked in the same chain of stores;[10] his mother, Sheila Gaiman (née Goldman), was a pharmacist. He has two younger sisters.[6] After living for a period in the nearby town of Portchester, where Neil was born in 1960, the family settled in 1965 in the West Sussex town of East Grinstead . Gaiman lived there for many years, from 1965-1980 and again from 1984-1987.[13] Gaiman was educated at several Church of England schools, including Fonthill School (East Grinstead),[13] Ardingly College (1970-74), and Whitgift School (Croydon) (1974-77).[14]

[edit] Journalism, early writings, and literary influences
As a child and a teenager, Gaiman grew up reading the works of C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Ursula K. Le Guin, Lord Dunsany and G. K. Chesterton. He later became a fan of science fiction, reading the works of authors as diverse as Samuel R. Delany, Roger Zelazny, Robert A. Heinlein, Harlan Ellison, H. P. Lovecraft, Thorne Smith, Alan Moore, and Gene Wolfe.
In the early 1980s, Gaiman pursued journalism, conducting interviews and writing book reviews, as a means to learn about the world and to make connections that he hoped would later assist him in getting published. He wrote and reviewed extensively for the British Fantasy Society. [15] His first professional short story publication was "Featherquest", a fantasy story, in Imagine Magazine in May 1984, when he was 23.[16]
In 1984, he wrote his first book, a biography of the band Duran Duran, as well as Ghastly Beyond Belief, a book of quotations, with Kim Newman. He also wrote interviews and articles for many British magazines, including Knave. As he was writing for different magazines, some of them competing, and "wrote too many articles", he sometimes went by a number of pseudonyms: Gerry Musgrave, Richard Grey, "along with a couple of house names".[17]
In the late 1980s, he wrote Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion in what he calls a "classic English humour" style. Following on from that he wrote the opening of what would become his collaboration with Terry Pratchett on the comic novel Good Omens, about the impending apocalypse.[18]

[edit] Comics
After forming a friendship with comic book writer Alan Moore, Gaiman started writing comics, picking up Miracleman after Moore finished his run on the series. Gaiman and artist Mark Buckingham collaborated on several issues of the series before its publisher, Eclipse Comics, collapsed, leaving the series unfinished. His first published comic strips were four short Future Shocks for 2000 AD in 1986-7. He wrote three graphic novels with his favorite collaborator and long-time friend Dave McKean: Violent Cases, Signal to Noise, and The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch. In between, he landed a job with DC Comics, his first work being the limited series Black Orchid.[19]
Gaiman has written numerous comics for several publishers. His award-winning series The Sandman tells the tale of Morpheus, the anthropomorphic personification of Dream. The series began in 1989 and concluded in 1996: the 75 issues of the regular series, along with an illustrated prose text and a special containing seven short stories, have been collected into 11 volumes that remain in print.
In 1989, Gaiman published The Books of Magic (collected in 1991), a four-part mini-series that provided a tour of the mythological and magical parts of the DC Universe through a frame story about an English teenager who discovers that he is destined to be the world's greatest wizard. The miniseries was popular, and sired an ongoing series written by John Ney Rieber.
In the mid-90s, he also created a number of new characters and a setting that was to be featured in a title published by Tekno Comix. The concepts were then altered and split between three titles set in the same continuity: Lady Justice, Mr. Hero the Newmatic Man, and Teknophage.[20] They were later featured in Phage: Shadow Death and Wheel of Worlds. Although Neil Gaiman's name appeared prominently on all titles, he was not involved in writing of any of the above-mentioned books (though he helped plot the zero issue of Wheel of Worlds).
Gaiman wrote a semi-autobiographical story about a boy's fascination with Michael Moorcock's anti-hero Elric for Ed Kramer's anthology Tales of the White Wolf. In 1996, Gaiman and Ed Kramer co-edited The Sandman: Book of Dreams. Nominated for the British Fantasy Award, the original fiction anthology featured stories and contributions by Tori Amos, Clive Barker, Gene Wolfe, Tad Williams, and others.
Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling Gaiman said “One of the joys of comics has always been the knowledge that it was, in many ways, untouched ground. It was virgin territory. When I was working on Sandman, I felt a lot of the time that I was actually picking up a machete and heading out into the jungle. I got to write in places and do things that nobody had ever done before. When I’m writing novels I’m painfully aware that I’m working in a medium that people have been writing absolutely jaw-droppingly brilliant things for, you know, three-four thousand years now. You know, you can go back. We have things like The Golden Compass. And you go, well, I don’t know that I’m as good as that and that’s two and a half thousand years old. But with comics I felt like — I can do stuff nobody has ever done. I can do stuff nobody has ever thought of. And I could and it was enormously fun.”[21]
In 2009, Gaiman will write a two-part Batman story for DC Comics to follow Batman R.I.P. It will be called "Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?" a play off of the classic Superman story "Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?" by Alan Moore.[22][23][24] He will also be contributing a twelve-page Metamorpho story for a project Mike Allred is putting together.[25]

[edit] Novels
See also: Neil Gaiman bibliography
In a collaboration with author Terry Pratchett (best known for his series of Discworld novels), Neil Gaiman's first novel Good Omens was published in 1990. In recent years Pratchett has said that while the entire novel was a collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them, Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaiman's scheduled involvement with Sandman.[26]
The 1996 novelization of Neil Gaiman's teleplay for the BBC mini-series Neverwhere was his first solo novel. The novel was released in tandem with the television series though it presents some notable differences from the television series. In 1999 first printings of his fantasy novel Stardust were released. The novel has been released both as a standard novel and in an illustrated text edition.
American Gods became one of Gaiman's best-selling and multi-award winning novels upon its release in 2001[27]
In 2005, his novel Anansi Boys was released worldwide. The book deals with Anansi ('Mr. Nancy'), a supporting character in American Gods. Specifically it traces the relationship of his two sons, one semi-divine and the other an unaware Englishman of American origin, as they explore their common heritage. It hit the New York Times bestseller list at number one.[28]
In late 2008, Gaiman released a new children's book, The Graveyard Book. It follows the adventures of a boy named Bod after his family is murdered and he is left to be brought up by a graveyard. It is heavily influenced by Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. As of late January 2009, it has been on the New York Times Bestseller children's list for 15 weeks.[29]
As of 2008, Gaiman has several books planned. After a tour of China, he decided to write a non-fiction book about his travels and the general mythos of China. Following that, will be a new 'adult' novel (his first since 2005's Anansi Boys). After that, another 'all-ages' book (in the same vein as Coraline and The Graveyard Book). Following that, Gaiman says that he will release another non-fiction book called, The Dream Catchers.[30]

[edit] Film and screenwriting
See also: Neil_Gaiman_bibliography#Film_and_television
Gaiman wrote the 1996 BBC dark fantasy television series Neverwhere. He cowrote the screenplay for the movie MirrorMask with his old friend Dave McKean for McKean to direct. In addition, he wrote the localized English language script to the anime movie Princess Mononoke, based on a translation of the Japanese script.
He cowrote the script for Robert Zemeckis's Beowulf with Roger Avary, a collaboration that has proved productive for both writers.[31] Gaiman has expressed interest in collaborating on a film adaptation of the Epic of Gilgamesh.[32]
He was the only person other than J. Michael Straczynski to write a Babylon 5 script in the last 3 seasons, contributing the season 5 episode "Day of the Dead".
Gaiman has also written at least three drafts of a screenplay adaptation of Nicholson Baker's novel The Fermata for director Robert Zemeckis,[citation needed] although the project was stalled while Zemeckis made The Polar Express and the Gaiman-Roger Avary written Beowulf film.
Several of Gaiman's original works have been optioned or greenlighted for film adaptation, most notably Stardust, which premiered in August 2007 and stars Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Claire Danes, directed by Matthew Vaughn. A stop-motion version of Coraline was released on 6 February 2009, with Henry Selick directing and Dakota Fanning and Teri Hatcher in the leading voice-actor roles.[33]
In 2007 Gaiman announced that after ten years in development the feature film of Death: The High Cost of Living would finally begin production with a screenplay by Gaiman that he would direct for Warner Independent. Don Murphy and Susan Montford are the producers, and Guillermo del Toro is the film's executive producer.[34][35]
Seeing Ear Theatre performed an audio play of "Snow, Glass, Apples," Gaiman's retelling of Snow White, which was published in the collection Smoke and Mirrors in 1998.
Neil's 2009 Newbery-Medal winning book 'The Graveyard Book' will be made into a movie, with Neil Jordan being announced as the director during Gaiman's appearance on The Today Show, 27 January 2009.

[edit] Blog
In February 2001, when Gaiman had completed writing American Gods, his publishers set up a promotional web site featuring a weblog in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of revising, publishing, and promoting the novel. After the novel was published, the web site evolved into a more general Official Neil Gaiman Website.[36]
Gaiman generally posts to the blog several times a week, describing the day-to-day process of being Neil Gaiman and writing, revising, publishing, or promoting whatever the current project is. He also posts reader emails and answers questions, which gives him unusually direct and immediate interaction with fans. One of his answers on why he writes the blog is "because writing is, like death, a lonely business."[37]
The original American Gods blog was extracted for publication in the NESFA Press collection of Gaiman miscellany, Adventures in the Dream Trade.
To celebrate the 7th anniversary of the blog, the novel American Gods was provided free of charge online for a month.

[edit] Friendships
Gaiman maintains friendships with several celebrities outside the comic book and science fiction fields, including:

comedic fantasy author Terry Pratchett, with whom he collaborated on the novel Good Omens (it is not uncommon to see Terry Pratchett in the acknowledgements in Gaiman's books, and Gaiman in Pratchett's).
singer/songwriter/performer Stephin Merritt, who has written music and lyrics for a stage musical of Coraline and with whom he is collaborating on a "mystery project".[citation needed]
singer/songwriter/performer Amanda Palmer, with whom he is collaborating on an art book to be released as a companion piece to her debut solo album, Who Killed Amanda Palmer.[citation needed]
singer/songwriter Jonathan Coulton, whom he has joined in performances on stage on several occasions.[citation needed]
singer Thea Gilmore.[38]
actor/comedian Lenny Henry, a fan of Black Orchid who pitched the idea that eventually became Neverwhere to Gaiman[39].
Jonathan Ross and his wife Jane Goldman, who appear as 'themselves' in Gaiman's short story "The Mysterious Disappearance of Miss Finch" which was included in his Fragile Things collection, having initially appeared in the English/UK edition of Smoke and Mirrors. Ross plays himself in Gaiman's short film A Short Film About John Bolton, and Gaiman appears in Ross's documentary In Search of Steve Ditko.
illusionist Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller, who has mentioned Gaiman on his Free FM radio show,[citation needed] and appeared in the Gaiman-written "Day of the Dead" episode of Babylon 5.
director Terry Gilliam, whom Pratchett and Gaiman teased by agreeing to sell him a film option for Good Omens for one groat.[40]
writer and director Roger Avary, whom has worked with Neil on both Beowulf and Black Hole. The two met while Avary was developing the Sandman film at Warner Brothers.[41]
author Kim Newman, helping develop the outline for (and originally planning to coauthor) his Anno Dracula series. Gaiman was also thanked in the back of the first novel in the series.[42]
author Diana Wynne Jones, whom he met at a conference. They have been friends and fans of each others' work since then. Wynne Jones dedicated her YA sci-fi/fantasy novel Hexwood to Gaiman. Gaiman has acknowledged that the premise of American Gods was inspired in part by Wynne Jones's children's book Eight Days of Luke.[citation needed]
author Douglas Adams, whose book The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's introduction was written by Gaiman.[citation needed]


[edit] Friendship with Tori Amos
One of Gaiman's most commented-upon friendships is his friendship with the musician Tori Amos, a Sandman fan who became fast friends with Gaiman after making reference to "Neil and the Dream King" on her 1991 demo tape, and whom he included as a character (a talking tree) in Stardust.[43] Amos also mentions Gaiman in her songs, "Tear in Your Hand" ("If you need me, me and Neil'll be hangin' out with the dream king. Neil says hi by the way")[44], "Space Dog" ("Where's Neil when you need him?")[45], "Horses" ("But will you find me if Neil makes me a tree?")[46], and "Carbon" ("Get me Neil on the line, no I can't hold. Have him read, 'Snow, Glass, Apples' where nothing is what it seems")[47]. He also wrote stories for the tour book of Boys for Pele and Scarlet's Walk, a letter for the tour book of American Doll Posse, and the stories behind each girl in her album Strange Little Girls. Amos penned the introduction for his novel Death: the High Cost of Living, and posed for the cover. She also wrote a song called "Sister Named Desire" based on his Sandman character, which was included on his anthology, Where's Neil When You Need Him?.
Neil Gaiman is godfather to Tori Amos's daughter Tash,[48] and wrote a poem called Blueberry Girl for Tori and Tash.[49] The poem has been turned into a book by the illustrator Charles Vess.[50] He read the poem aloud to an audience in San Francisco on 5 October 2008 during his book reading tour for The Graveyard Book.[51] It will be published in March 2009 with the title, Blueberry Girl.
S. Alexander Reed has written about the intertextual relationships between Gaiman's and Amos's respective work. Reed does close readings of several of Gaiman's allusions to Amos, arguing that the reference to Amos happens as the texts expand and broaden their focus, and that Amos serves to disrupt the linear flow of the narrative. He reads this disruption in terms of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's idea of the mirror stage, arguing that the mutual referentiality serves to create an ideal vision of the reader-as-fan that the actual reader encounters and misrecognizes as themselves, thus drawing the reader into the role of the devoted (and paying) fan. The essay also contains a fairly thorough list of known references in both Gaiman's and Amos's work.[52]

[edit] Litigations
In 1993, Gaiman was contracted by Todd McFarlane to write a single issue of Spawn, a popular title at the newly created Image Comics company. McFarlane was promoting his new title by having guest authors Gaiman, Alan Moore, Frank Miller, and Dave Sim each write a single issue.
In issue #9 of the series, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, Cogliostro, and Medieval Spawn. Prior to this issue, Spawn was an assassin who worked for the government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no direction. In Angela, a cruel and malicious angel, Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn's existence, as well as providing a moral opposite. Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction, providing guidance. Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self-serving or evil, giving additional character development to Malebolgia, the demon that creates Hellspawn.
As intended (and legally allowed)[53], all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe. In papers filed by Neil Gaiman in early 2002, however, he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter (himself) and artist (McFarlane), not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series.[54][55] Ironically, disagreement over who owned the rights to a character was the primary motivation for McFarlane and other artists to form Image Comics (although that argument related more towards disagreements between writers and artists as character creators).[56] As McFarlane used the characters without Gaiman's permission or royalty payments, Gaiman believed his copyrighted work was being infringed upon, which violated their original, oral, agreement.[citation needed] McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters, and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively 'swap' McFarlane's interest in the character Miracleman[57] (McFarlane believes he purchased interest in the character when Eclipse Comics was liquidated; Gaiman is interested in being able to continue his aborted run on that title) but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's creations entirely.[citation needed] The presiding Judge, however, ruled against their agreement being work for hire, based in large part on the legal ruling that "copyright assignments must be in writing."[58]
The 24 February 2004 ruling ultimately upheld a district court ruling in October 2002[59] granting joint ownership of the characters to Gaiman and McFarlane. On the specific issue of Cogliostro, presiding Judge John Shabaz proclaimed "The expressive work that is the comic-book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane—their contributions strike us as quite equal—and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright".[60]
This legal battle was brought by Gaiman and the specifically-formed Marvels and Miracles, LLC, which Gaiman created in order to help sort out the legal rights surrounding Miracleman (see the ownership of Miracleman sub-section of the Miracleman article). Gaiman wrote Marvel 1602 in 2003 to help fund this project.[61] All of Marvel Comics' profits for the original issues of the series went to Marvels and Miracles.[61]
Gaiman is a major supporter and board member of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.[62]

[edit] Awards




Neil Gaiman in 2004.



Gaiman received a World Fantasy Award for short fiction in 1991 for the Sandman issue, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (see Dream Country). (Due to a subsequent rules change disqualifying comics for that category, Gaiman is the only writer to win that award for a comics script.)[citation needed]
He has won the Comics Buyer's Guide Award for Favorite Writer for the years 1991-1993, and received nominations from 1997-2000. His work on The Sandman was awarded the Favourite Comic Book Story for 1991 and 1994.[citation needed]
Gaiman was awarded the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund Defender of Liberty award in 1997.[63]
The illustrated version of Stardust won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature 1999.[64]
In 2000, The Sandman: The Dream Hunters was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Related Book and won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Illustrated Narrative.[citation needed]
American Gods won the Hugo Award for Best Novel 2002, the Nebula Award for Best Novel 2002, the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel 2002[65] and the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel 2001. It is among the most-honored works of fiction in recent history.[66]
Coraline won the Hugo Award for Best Novella 2003, the Nebula Award for Best Novella 2003, the Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book 2003[67] and the Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers 2002.[citation needed]
In 2004, his short story "A Study in Emerald" won another Hugo (in a ceremony the author presided over himself, having volunteered for the job before his story was nominated). Also in 2004, The Sandman: Endless Nights won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Illustrated Narrative and The Sandman: Season of Mists won the Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario.[citation needed]
In 2005, Marvel 1602 won the Quill Book Award for Graphic Novels.[68]
Anansi Boys won him a second Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature in 2006. The book was also nominated for a Hugo Award, but Gaiman asked for it to be withdrawn from the list of nominations, stating that he wanted to give other writers a chance, and it was really more fantasy than science fiction.[69]
Gaiman has won 19 Eisner Awards for his comics work.[citation needed]
From the comics fans in the rec.arts.comics* newsgroups, Gaiman won the Squiddy Award for Best Writer five years in a row from 1990 to 1994. He was also named Best Writer of the 1990s in the Squiddy Awards for the decade.[citation needed]
In 2007 he was awarded the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award.[70]
In 2007 Gaiman was presented with the Comic-Con Icon award at the Scream Awards.[citation needed]
In January 2009, Gaiman's The Graveyard Book was awarded the Newbery Medal.[71] In March 2009, it was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel.[72]


[edit] References in popular culture

In SimCity 2000, if you query a library and click "Ruminate" an article about cities' personalities appears which was written by Gaiman. The article is also available on the official Gaiman website[citation needed].


In the science-fiction television series Babylon 5, one of the races (The Gaim) is named in homage to Gaiman[citation needed].


[edit] Literary allusions
Gaiman's work is known for a high degree of allusiveness.[73] Meredith Collins, for instance, has commented upon the degree to which his novel Stardust depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture.[74] Particularly in The Sandman, literary figures and characters appear often; the character of Fiddler's Green is modelled visually on G.K. Chesterton, both William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer appear as characters, as do several characters from within A Midsummer Night's Dream. The comic also draws from numerous mythologies and historical periods. Such allusions are not unique to Sandman.
Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works, often to the exclusion of his collaborators.[75] However, Smith's viewpoint is in the minority: to many, if there is a problem with Gaiman scholarship and intertextuality it is that "... his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work." [76]
David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel Coraline, where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on Sigmund Freud's notion of the Uncanny, or the Unheimlich.[77]
Though Gaiman's work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure laid out in Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces,[78] Gaiman says that he started The Hero with a Thousand Faces but refused to finish it: "I think I got about half way through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking if this is true — I don’t want to know. I really would rather not know this stuff. I’d rather do it because it’s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is."[79]
