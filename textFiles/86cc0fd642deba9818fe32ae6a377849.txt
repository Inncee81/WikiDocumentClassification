[edit] Structure
SystemRescueCD is capable of graphics using the Linux framebuffer option for tools such as GParted. It uses Linux 2.6.27.14 and has options such as connecting to the Internet through an ADSL modem or Ethernet and graphical web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox.

[edit] Features
SystemRescueCD has several features, some of them include:

GNU Parted and GParted to partition disks and re-size partitions, including FAT32 and NTFS
Ranish Partition Manager
fdisk to edit the disk partition table
PartImage, disk imaging software which copies only used sectors
TestDisk to recover lost partition and PhotoRec to recover lost data
A CD and DVD burner
Two bootloaders
Web browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Lynx, Links, Dillo
Midnight Commander
Archiving and unarchiving abilities
File system tools: file system create, delete, resize, move
Support for many file systems, including full NTFS read/write access (via NTFS-3G) as well as FAT32 and Mac OS HFS
Support for Intel x86 and PowerPC systems, including Macs
Ability to create boot disk for operating systems
Support for Windows registry editing and password changing from Linux
Can boot FreeDOS, memory testing, hardware diagnostics and other boot disks from a single CD


[edit] Burning DVDs and system backup
The CD can also boot from a customized DVD which has almost 4.6 GB of free space for backed-up files. This makes it good for storing all the information that is needed from a hard drive and then formatting it. To burn the DVD, one has to burn the image file first and then add all the separate files as well as folders. This should not affect the general way in which the DVD works. Then the DVD can be used to insert those files into the hard drive using Midnight Commander.
