Tsukumogami from Hyakki Yako Emaki


Tsukumogami (付喪神 ?, "ninety-nine of ago spirit") are a type of Japanese spirit. According to the Tsukumogami-emaki, tsukumogami originate from items or artifacts that have reached their 100th birthday and thus become alive and aware. Any object of this age, from swords to toys, can become a tsukumogami. Tsukumogami are considered spirits and supernatural beings, as opposed to enchanted items.

[edit] Description
Tsukumogami vary radically in appearance, depending on the type of item they originated from as well as the condition that item was in. Some, such as tsukumogami originating from paper lanterns or broken sandals, can have tears which become eyes and sharp teeth, thus giving a horrifying visage. Others, such as worn prayer beads or teacups, may merely manifest faces and appendages, giving a warm and friendly appearance.
Though by and large tsukumogami are harmless and at most tend to play occasional pranks on unsuspecting victims, as shown in the Otogizōshi they do have the capacity for anger and will band together to take revenge on those who are wasteful or throw them away thoughtlessly. To prevent this, to this day some Jinja ceremonies, such as the Hari Kuyou, are performed to console broken and unusable items.
It is said that modern items cannot become tsukumogami; the reason for this is that tsukumogami are said to be repelled by electricity.[1] Additionally, few modern items are used for the 100-year-span that it takes for an artifact to gain a soul.

[edit] Origins
Though they generally considered as mythical or legendary beings, almost all of tsukumogami with names are artistic production created in Edo period.[citation needed] The most popular artist is Toriyama Sekien, but other numerous artists added their own creatures to the list of tsukumogami. Folk narratives about tsukumogami are rare but exist in some folktales (e.g. Bakemono-dera).

[edit] Types of tsukumogami
Some of the better known tsukumogami include the following:

Bakezori: straw sandals
Karakasa (or Kasa Obake): umbrellas
Chochinobake: lanterns
Ittan-momen: roll of cotton
Biwa-yanagi: biwa
Furu-utsubo: old jars
Shirouneri: thrown away, useless mosquito netting; or dust cloths
Jotai: cloth draped from folding screens
Morinji-no-okama: tea kettle
Kyourinrin: scrolls and paper
Zorigami: clocks
Ichiren-Bozu: the heroic prayer-bead tsukumogami from the Otogizōshi
Yamaoroshi:grater; or porcupine
