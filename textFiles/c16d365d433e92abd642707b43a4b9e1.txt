The Hatfield clan in 1897.






A section of the floodwall along the Tug Fork in Matewan, West Virginia, constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, depicts the Hatfield-McCoy feud.


The Hatfield-McCoy feud (1878 – 1891) is an account of American lore that has become a metaphor for bitterly feuding rival parties in general. It involved two warring families of the West Virginia-Kentucky backcountry along the Tug Fork River, off the Big Sandy River. The Hatfields involved in the feud descended from Ephraim (born c. 1765), and the McCoys from William (born c. 1750). Partial family trees for both clans are shown at the end of this article.

[edit] Family origins
The McCoys, led by Randolph "Ole Ran’l" McCoy (grandson of William), lived mostly on the Kentucky side of Tug Fork (a tributary of the Big Sandy River), and the Hatfields, led by William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield (great-grandson of Ephraim), lived mostly on the West Virginia side. Both families were part of the first wave of pioneers to settle the Tug Valley. The majority of the Hatfields living in Mingo County (in what would eventually become West Virginia), fought for the Confederacy in the American Civil War. The majority of the McCoys living in Pike County Kentucky fought for the Union army. The first real violence in the feud was the murder of a returning Union soldier, Asa Harman McCoy. Harman was killed by a group of ex-Confederate Homeguard called the "Logan Wildcats". Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first but later confirmed to have been at home, sick at the time of the murder.[1]
The Hatfields were more affluent than the McCoys and were well-connected politically. "Devil Anse" Hatfield's timbering operation was a source of wealth for his family, but he employed many non-Hatfields, and even hired Albert McCoy, Lorenzo Dow McCoy, and Selkirk McCoy.

[edit] The major players

[edit] Hatfield clan

Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield, the younger, more militant brother of eldest Hatfield, Valentine, led the clan in most of their combative endeavors.


Valentine "Uncle Wall" Hatfield, the elder brother of "Devil Anse" was overshadowed by Anderson's ambitions but was one of the eight convicted to end the feud. He died in prison of unknown causes. He had petitioned his brothers to assist in his emancipation from jail, but none came for fear of being captured and brought to trial. He was buried in the prison cemetery which has since been paved over.


Doc D Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine and brother of Pliant, was one of the eight convicted to end the feud. He served 14 years in prison before returning home to live with his son Melvin.


Pliant Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine, brother of Doc, was one of the eight convicted to end the feud. He served 14 years in prison before returning home to rejoin his ex-wife who had remarried (she left her second husband to be with Pliant again).


[edit] The feud

[edit] Beginning
"Most people believe that the Hatfield-McCoy feud began with the death of Asa Harman McCoy (Randall McCoy's brother) on January 7, 1863." The uncle of Devil Anse, Jim Vance, and his "Logan Wildcats" despised Asa Harmon McCoy because he had joined the Union army during the American Civil War. Harman had been discharged from the army early because of a broken leg; several nights after he returned home, he was murdered in a nearby cave.
The second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred after an 1878 dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield had it and Randolph McCoy said it was his.[2] The pig was only in the fight because some of the Hatfields believed that since the pig was on their land, that meant it was theirs; some of the McCoys objected saying the "notches" or "marks' on the pigs ears were McCoy marks, and not Hatfield marks. The matter was taken to the local Justice of the Peace, and the McCoys lost because of the testimony of Bill Staton, a relative of both families. The individual presiding over the case was Anderson "Preacher Anse" Hatfield. In June 1880, Staton Hatfield was killed by two McCoy brothers, Sam and Paris, who were later acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.

[edit] Escalation
The feud escalated after Roseanna McCoy began an affair with Johnse Hatfield (Devil Anse's son), leaving her family to live with the Hatfields in West Virginia. Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse Hatfield was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky bootlegging warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Devil Anse Hatfield, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported to the county seat, Pikeville Kentucky for justice the next day.
Despite what was seen as a betrayal of her family on his behalf, Johnse thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna, marrying instead her cousin Nancy McCoy in 1881.
The escalation continued in 1882 when Ellison Hatfield, brother of "Devil Anse" Hatfield, was killed by three of Roseanna McCoy's young brothers: Tolbert, Pharmer, and Bud. Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a shot during an election day fight that took place in Kentucky. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield constables and were being taken to Pikeville for trial. Devil Anse Hatfield organized a large group of followers and cut off the constables with McCoy prisoners in toll before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia to await the fate of mortally wounded Ellison Hatfield. When Ellison finnally died from his injuries the McCoy brothers were themselves murdered in turn as the vendetta escalated. They were tied to pawpaw bushes, where each was shot numerous times. Their bodies were described as "bullet-riddled".[citation needed]
The escalation reach its peak during the 1888 New Years Night Massacre. Several of the Hatfield gang surrounded the McCoy cabin and opened fire on the sleeping family. The cabin was set on fire in an effort to drive Randal McCoy into the open. He escaped by making a break but two of his children were murdered and his wife was beaten and left for dead. The remaining McCoy family moved to Pikeville to escape the West Virginia raiding parties.
Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families, becoming headline news around the country, and compelling the governors of both Kentucky and West Virginia to call up their state militias to restore order[citation needed] The Governer of West Virginia once even threatened to have his militia invade Kentucky. Kentucky Governer S.B. Buckner in response sent his Adjutant General to Pike County to investigate the situation. Newspapers from around the country awaited word from Adjutant General Sam Hill to find out "what in the Sam Hill was going on up there".
In 1888, Wall Hatfield and eight others were arrested by a posse led by Frank Phillips, and brought to Kentucky to stand trial for the murder of Alifair McCoy who was killed during the New Years Massacre.[3] She had been shot after exiting the burning house. Because of issues of due process and illegal extradition, the United States Supreme Court became involved (Mahon v. Justice, 127 U.S. 700 (1888)). The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kentucky. Eventually the men were tried in Kentucky and all were found guilty. Seven received life imprisonment, while the eighth, Ellison "Cottontop" Mounts, was executed by hanging.[4] Thousands attended the hanging in Pikeville, Kentucky.

[edit] The feud ends
The families finally agreed to stop the fighting in 1891. The trial of Johnse Hatfield was the last of the feud trials. It took place in 1901.
In 1979, the two families united for a special week's taping of the popular game show Family Feud, in which they played for a cash prize and a pig which was kept on stage during the games.[5]
On June 14, 2003, on the initiative of Reo Hatfield, an actual peace treaty was drawn up and signed in Pikeville by representatives of the two families, even though the feud had ended over a century before. The idea was symbolic: to show that Americans could bury their differences and unite in times of crisis, most notably following the September 11 attacks.[6]

[edit] Descendants
Assassinated police chief Sid Hatfield and singer-songwriter Juliana Hatfield[7] are descendants of the Hatfield family.
Bobaflex, a rock band formed in the 1990s, has two frontmen, brothers Shaun and Marty McCoy, who have ancestral ties to the McCoys.

[edit] Tourism
Many tourists each year travel to parts of West Virginia and Kentucky to see the areas and historic relics which remain from the days of the feud. In 2004 a large project known as the "Hatfield and McCoy historic site restoration" was completed. This project was funded by a federal grant from the SBA. Many improvements to various feud sites were completed. A committee of local historians spent months researching reams of information to find the factual history of the events surrounding the feud. This research was compiled in a audio CD called the "Hatfield - McCoy Feud Driving Tour". The CD is a self guided driving tour of the restored feud sites. It includes maps and pictures as well as the audio CD. (see external link below)
Bo McCoy, a college student, organized a joint reunion of the Hatfield and McCoy gangs in 2000 which attained national attention; more than 5000 persons attended the reunion dubbed "The Reunion of the Millennium".[8]
Additionally, an entire recreation area, the 500 mile (800 km) Hatfield-McCoy Trails system, has been created around the theme of the Hatfield-McCoy Feud.[9]

[edit] Films and Television
In 1949, the feature film Roseanna McCoy tells the story of the romance between the title character, played by Joan Evans, and Johnse Hatfield, played by Farley Granger.[19] In 1975, a television movie titled The Hatfields and the McCoys retells the feud.[20]
The two feuding families on Pumpkinhead: Blood feud are called Hatfield and McCoy. [21]

As Bugs claims (unintentionally) that he belongs to the opposing family (by saying his friends say he's very "coy"), the Martins attempt to seek vengeance. Needless to say, Bugs triumphs as usual in the end. [3]
