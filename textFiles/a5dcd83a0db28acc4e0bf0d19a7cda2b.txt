Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a Linux kernel virtualization infrastructure. KVM currently supports native virtualization using Intel VT or AMD-V. Limited support for paravirtualization is also available for Linux guests and Windows in the form of a paravirtual network driver,[1] a balloon driver to affect operation of the guest virtual memory manager,[2] and CPU optimization for Linux guests. KVM is currently implemented as a loadable kernel module although future versions will likely use a system call interface and be integrated directly into the kernel.[3]
Architecture ports are currently being developed for s390,[4] PowerPC,[5] and IA64. The first version of KVM was included in Linux 2.6.20 (February 2007).[6] KVM has also been ported to FreeBSD as a loadable kernel module.[7]
A wide variety of guest operating systems work with KVM, including many flavours of Linux, BSD, Solaris, Windows, Haiku, ReactOS and AROS Research Operating System[8] and a patched version of kvm is able to run Mac OS X[9]
By itself, KVM does not perform any emulation. Instead, a user-space program uses the /dev/kvm interface to set up the guest VM's address space, feed it simulated I/O and map its video display back onto the host's. At least three programs exploit this feature: a modified version of Qemu, Qemu itself since version 0.10.0 and, optionally, Virtualbox.
KVM's parts are licensed under various GNU licenses:[10]

KVM kernel module: GPL v2
KVM user module: LGPL v2
QEMU virtual CPU core library (libqemu.a) and QEMU PC system emulator: LGPL
Linux user mode QEMU emulator: GPL
BIOS files (bios.bin, vgabios.bin and vgabios-cirrus.bin): LGPL v2 or later

KVM is maintained by Avi Kivity and is funded primarily by Qumranet, a technology start up,[11] now owned by Red Hat.[12]
