[edit] Stats
Among the over 300 films on the original ballot:

Tom Hanks and Henry Fonda are the two most represented actors, in eight nominated films each. Gary Cooper and Sidney Poitier each star in seven nominated films.
James Stewart played the main role in two out of the top five films (It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). He also starred in The Spirit of St. Louis (#69).
Jean Arthur, with four nominated films, is the most represented actress.
Frank Capra and Steven Spielberg each have directed six nominees.
Over one-third of the films are biographical in nature.
Twelve of the films were released in 1939, more than any other year; five of the 100 eventually selected were from that year.
