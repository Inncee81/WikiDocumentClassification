A comma splice is a sentence in which two independent clauses are joined by a comma without a coordinating conjunction. For example:

It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.[1]

Comma splices are generally considered errors in both British and American English although they are acceptable in some languages, including French and German.

[edit] The prescriptive view
Comma splices are condemned in The Elements of Style, a popular American English style guide by E.B. White and William Strunk, Jr.[2]
According to Joanne Buckley,[3] writers often use conjunctive adverbs to separate two independent clauses instead of using a coordinating conjunction and, in doing so, create comma splices. A coordinating conjunction is one of the following seven words: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. A conjunctive adverb, on the other hand, is a word like furthermore, however, moreover. However, a conjunctive adverb and a comma or a conjunctive adverb between two commas is not strong enough to separate two independent clauses and creates a comma splice. Only semicolons and periods are strong enough to separate two independent clauses without a conjunction.
Grammarians disagree as to whether a comma splice also constitutes a run-on sentence. Some define run-on sentences to include comma splices,[4] but others limit the term to strictly mean those in which independent clauses are joined without any punctuation, thereby excluding comma splices.[5][6]

[edit] Acceptable uses
Strunk & White note that splices are sometimes acceptable when the clauses are short and alike in form, such as:

The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn up.

Fowler[7] (third edition, 1996) notes a number of examples by reputable authors:


“
We are all accustomed to the ... conjoined sentences that turn up from children or from our less literate friends... Curiously, this habit of writing comma-joined sentences is not uncommon in both older and present-day fiction. Modern examples: I have the bed still, it is in every way suitable for the old house where I live now (E. Jolley); Marcus ... was of course already quite a famous man, Ludens had even heard of him from friends at Cambridge (I. Murdoch).
”


The comma splice is often considered acceptable in poetic writing. The editors of the Jerusalem Bible translate Isaiah 11:4 as:

His word is a rock that strikes the ruthless, his sentences bring death to the wicked.[8]

Lynne Truss[9] observes: "so many highly respected writers observe the splice comma that a rather unfair rule emerges on this one: only do it if you're famous." She cites Samuel Beckett, E. M. Forster, and Somerset Maugham. "Done knowingly by an established writer, the comma splice is effective, poetic, dashing. Done equally knowingly by people who are not published writers, it can look weak or presumptuous. Done ignorantly by ignorant people, it is awful."

[edit] Correction
Simply removing the comma does not correct the error, but results in a run-on sentence. There are several ways to correct this:

Change the comma to a semicolon:


It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.


Write the two clauses as two separate sentences:


It is nearly half past five. We cannot reach town before dark.


Insert a coordinating conjunction following the comma:


It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark.
It is nearly half past five, so we cannot reach town before dark.


Make one clause dependent on the other:


As it is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.
It is nearly half past five, therefore we cannot reach town before dark.
