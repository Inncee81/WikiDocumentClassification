[edit] Characters

Hiram Patterson is the father of Bobby Patterson and David Curzon, and the founder and CEO of the fictional company OurWorld. His first name in Hebrew means "high-bred" which depicts his high status. The success of the WormCam and the SmartShroud (which makes objects invisible, thus undetectable by the WormCam) is only the tip of the iceberg for him; he plans to use wormholes to extract energy from the Earth and the stars themselves in order to monopolize the energy industry. As the main antagonist, Hiram seems to be the personification of a misanthropic view of humanity — greedy, Machiavellian, and entirely self-serving. He manipulates the main characters starting in the first chapter; Bobby is given a brain implant so he can be controlled, David receives a superb education so that he may be useful in the future, while Kate is framed for helping a competing company (also allowing him to assert his control over Bobby). His supposed love for Bobby is in fact just a ploy to mold him into the perfect heir.


David Curzon is Hiram Patterson's son from his first marriage and Bobby Patterson's half-brother. His first name is derived from the biblical character, David, who was once the king of Israel.


Bobby Patterson is Hiram Patterson's cloned son and heir apparent, and the half-brother of David Curzon.


[edit] Plot summary
The wormhole technology is first used to send pure information via gamma rays, then developed further to transmit light waves. The media corporation who develops this advance can spy on anyone anywhere it chooses. A logical development from the laws of space-time allows light waves to be detected from the past. This enhances the wormhole technology into a "time viewer" where anyone opening a wormhole can view people and events from any point throughout time and space.
When the technology is released to the general public, it effectively destroys all secrecy and privacy. The novel examines the philosophical issues that arise from the world's population (increasingly suffering from ecological and political disturbances) being aware that they could be under constant observation by anyone, or that they could observe anyone without their knowledge. Anyone is able to observe the true past events of their families and their heroes. An underground forms which attempts to escape this observation; corruption and crime are drastically reduced; nations discover the true causes and outcomes of international conflicts; and religions worldwide are forced to reevaluate their divine histories. As the underground movement grows, it utilizes a direct neural interface coupled with the unlimited communication provided by the wormhole technology to develop a group mind.
One of the central themes of the novel is that history is biased towards viewpoints of the person who wrote it. Hence many great "historical" events often did not occur as they now are collectively remembered. For example, during the book's progression; the time viewer technology shows that Jesus was the illegitimate son of a Roman centurion and that Moses was based on a collection of stories rather than the actions of a real person.
In a climactic time-viewing experiment at the end of the novel, a time hole is opened to the beginning of life on Earth and it is discovered that all existing life is descended from a biological sample placed by intelligent beings (labeled Sisyphans) who inhabited the Earth over three billion years ago, trying to preserve genetic samples when geological and climatic changes and a large Bolide threatened an extinction level event.

[edit] Trivia

A time viewer is also used in Clarke's Childhood's End, although it plays a minor role in the plot. Clarke discusses this device and its use in other science fiction in the afterword to the novel.


The 1956 Isaac Asimov short story "The Dead Past" also deals with the construction of a time viewer. The revelation of its impact on privacy comprises part of its twist ending.


O.B.I.T. is an episode of the original Outer Limits TV show (aired 4 November 1963) which included a device that allowed viewing of recent past events.
