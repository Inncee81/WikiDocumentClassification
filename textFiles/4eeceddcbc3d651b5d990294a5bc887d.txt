A linkback is a method for Web authors to obtain notifications when other authors link to one of their documents. This enables authors to keep track of who is linking to, or referring to their articles. The three methods (Refback, Trackback, and Pingback) differ in how they accomplish this task.
Any of the four terms -- Linkback, Trackback, Pingback, or (rarely) Refback -- might also refer colloquially to items within a section upon the linked page that display the received notifications, usually along with a reciprocal link; Trackback is used most often for this purpose. Also, the word Trackback is often used colloquially to mean any kind of Linkback.
Linkback is also the name of an OLE-like open source framework for Mac OS X.



Refback
Trackback
Pingback


Trigger mechanism
Visitor to linking site clicks on the link, and his browser takes him to the linked site
Code on linking server examines added or updated documents, extracts links, and sends notification to linked server for each link found
Code on linking server examines added or updated documents, extracts links, and sends notification to linked server for each link found


Notification medium
HTTP referer value
HTTP POST
XML-RPC call


Capture mechanism
Examination of incoming HTTP referer values
Trackback capture script
XML-RPC function


Information sent by linking server
None


Linking site name (Optional)
Linking post title (Optional)
Linking post excerpt (Optional)
Linking post URL




Linked post URL
Linking post URL




Additional information presented to linked server
HTTP referer sent by a visitor's browser upon clicking the link
IP address of linking server
IP address of linking server


Autodiscovery mechanism (how the linking server finds out how and where to send the notification)
None
Specially-formatted information within the body of the linked page
Special HTTP header or LINK tag on the linked page


Action required when notification is received


Extract referer value from incoming HTTP headers
Retrieve referring page
Parse retrieved page for desired information




Gather desired information from

Given parameters
or retrieving and parsing the given URL






Retrieve page at "linking post URL"
Parse retrieved page for desired information




Advantages
Requires no special code on linking server (the link itself becomes the notification when someone clicks on it)
All the information desired by the linked server (Linking site name, post title, excerpt) is present in the notification itself


Notification mechanism has a complete technical specification
Less susceptible to spamming




Disadvantages


No notification unless someone actually clicks on the link
Relies upon visitors' browsers sending proper HTTP referer information
Linked site must retrieve and parse linking site's page to extract the information it wants




Notification requires positive action by linking server
Notification mechanism has only a partial technical specification
Autodiscovery information may prevent XHTML validation




Notification requires positive action by linking server
Linked site must retrieve and parse linking site's page to extract the information it wants
