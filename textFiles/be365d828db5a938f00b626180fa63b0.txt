Traditional chartreuse (#DFFF00)



Web color chartreuse (#7FFF00)

Chartreuse (pronounced /ʃɑrˈtruːz/, /ʃɑrˈtruːs/, /ʃɑrˈtrɝːz/;[1] French pronunciation: [ʃaʁtʁøz]) (the web color) is a color halfway between yellow and green that was named because of its resemblance to the green color of one of the French liqueurs called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764; whereas chartreuse (the traditional color) is a yellow color mixed with a small amount of green that was named because of its resemblance to the yellow color of one of the French liqueurs called yellow chartreuse, introduced in 1838.[2]
The web color chartreuse is the color precisely halfway between green and yellow, so it is 50% green and 50% yellow. It is one of the tertiary colors of the HSV color wheel.
The complementary (opposite) color of (the web color) chartreuse on the HSV color wheel is violet. Chartreuse is the most visible color to the human eye because it sits directly in the middle of the frequencies of visible light (assuming a linear scale).[3][unreliable source?]

Olive is a dark shade of yellow typically seen on green olives. It can be formed by adding a little black to yellow dye or paint. As a color word in the English language, it is unexpectedly old, appearing in late Middle English. Shaded green, it becomes olive drab. Olive can also be referred to as dark yellow. That the color olive is a shade of yellow can readily be ascertained by inspecting its hex code--the red and green values are equal, with no blue value, signifying a shade of yellow.
Sometimes people of what in the early 20th century was called the Mediterranean subrace of the Caucasian race are described as being "olive-skinned", to denote shades of medium toned white skin that is darker than the average color for Caucasians, such as many people from southern Italy. In religion, olive is sometimes used as a Church color during Ordinary Time. Shades of olive, such as Olive Drab, are frequently used for camouflage, or by the military in general. The complementary color of olive is lavender.

Olive drab is the color olive shaded toward a greener color.
The first recorded use of olive drab as a color name in English was in 1892. [11]
Olive drab was the color of the standard fighting uniform for U.S. GIs and military vehicles during World War II. U.S. soldiers often referred to their uniforms as "OD's" due to the color. The color used at the beginning of the war by the US Army was officially called Olive Drab #3, which was replaced by the darker Olive Drab #7 by 1944, and which was again replaced by Olive Green 107 or OG-107 sometime in the 1950s and continued as the official uniform color for combat fatigues through the Vietnam War, until replaced by ERDL camouflage uniforms. The ERDL uniforms were then replaced by M81 woodland camo fatigues as the primary US uniform scheme in the 1980s, and still retain olive drab as one of the color swatches in the pattern.
As a solid color, it is not as effective for camouflage as multiple-color camo schemes (i.e. US Army Combat Uniform, tigerstripe, MARPAT, Multicam, etc.), though it is still used by the U.S. military to color webbing and accessories. The military refers to the color as Olive Green 107, or more commonly OG 107.[12] There are very few countries still issuing uni-color Olive Drab uniforms, Israel, India and Austria being the exceptions.
The color is currently defined by the FS-595 paint standard.[13][14]

Lists of miscellaneous information should be avoided. Please relocate any relevant information into appropriate sections or articles. (April 2009)


Note: Any of these references to the color chartreuse made in artistic creations produced before the mid 1990s refer to the traditional color chartreuse (chartreuse yellow). Works produced since the mid 1990s may be referring to either the traditional color chartreuse (chartreuse yellow) or the web color chartreuse (chartreuse green), depending on the context.
Alcoholic beverages

Chartreuse (web color) (chartreuse green) represents green chartreuse liqueur; Chartreuse (traditional) (chartreuse yellow) represents yellow chartreuse liqueur.[2]

Art

Since the mid 1960s, water based fluorescent chartreuse (traditional) (chartreuse yellow) colored paint has been available to paint psychedelic black light paintings. (Fluorescent chartreuse yellow is one of the seven major colors used, in addition to fluorescent orange, fluorescent red, fluorescent cerise, fluorescent magenta, fluorescent "blue" (actually azure), and fluorescent green.)
In Modesto, California, there is a gallery and art school known as the Chartreuse Muse.

Automobiles

The Volkswagen Type 2 Transporter Westfalia model was well known for mostly being produced in the chartreuse color. The vehicle is referenced in the song "Convoy" (see below).

Electronics

It was announced over the radio in the early 1990's as part of a trivia clip that the third color that can be emitted by a red/green bi-color LED is officially known as chartreuse.[citation needed] The third color is now more correctly referred to as amber. This was a mistake most likely due to the fact that the Crayola crayon company incorrectly labeled an amber-like color in 1972 as being chartreuse; this color was in 1990 re-labeled Atomic Tangerine.
The early green LEDs are now sometimes called chartreuse to distinguish them from more-modern, deeper-green LEDs.[15]

Film

Chartreuse green is the color of the Autobot medic Ratchet in the live action 2007 Transformers film.[16]
The 1960 Universal film Chartroose Caboose featured a "bright green" colored train car.[17]

Firefighting

Since about 1973, a sort of fluorescent chartreuse (traditional) (chartreuse yellow) color has been adopted as the color of fire engines in parts of the United States and elsewhere. The reason behind this is that chartreuse fire engines are more visible on the streets than the traditional red fire engines, especially at night (the reason for this is the Purkinje Effect, i.e., the cones do not function as efficiently in dim light, so red objects appear to be black). In Australia and New Zealand this form of chartreuse yellow is also known as "ACT Yellow" as this is the color of the fire engines in the Australian Capital Territory.

Music

In "Convoy", a 1975 song by C.W. McCall, "11 long-haired friends of Jesus" were said to have taken part in the eponymous convoy in a "...chartreuse microbus".
In the song 50/50, on the album "Overnite Sensation" by Frank Zappa: "Well my teeth are all loose/and my breath is chartreuse".
In Kimya Dawson's song "Wandering Daughter", she says: "Go out for ceruleans, come home with chartreuses/Snip and cut bonsais, and turn them to spruces".
The song "You Dyed Your Hair Chartreuse," recorded by Louis Jordan and His Tympani Five, is directed at a girl who has "spent too much time in that beauty booth" and whose hair has turned chartreuse.

Religion

The Grande Chartreuse is a Catholic monastery in the Chartreuse mountains and the mother house of the Carthusian monks; it is the origin of Chartreuse liqueur, after which both yellow and green chartreuse colors are named.

Restaurants

The Chartroose Caboose is a restaurant in Kansas City, Missouri that specializes in Philadelphia steak sandwiches. [18]

Safety Clothing

Public utility workers in most cities wear clothing colored fluorescent traditional chartreuse (i.e., fluorescent chartreuse yellow) (officially called neon yellow) for safety purposes when working on the street. This color is also worn by bicyclists for safety purposes.

Sport

Fluorescent chartreuse (traditional) (chartreuse yellow) is sometimes used for tennis balls to make them easier to see when playing tennis.
Chartreuse (traditional) (chartreuse yellow) is one of the official colors of the Phoenix Mercury of the Women's National Basketball Association.
Chartreuse (both the traditional and web colors) is one of the most often used colors on fishing lures, especially for saltwater lures on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. In fishing the term chartreuse can vary between more yellowish and more green. Chartreuse is a popular color on lures for the inshore saltwater game fish speckled trout (aka spotted sea trout).

Television

In the television show The Angry Beavers, Norbert's girlfriend Treeflower fronts for a band called The Friendly Chartreuse Bubble Gum Machine.
In an episode of Goof Troop, Pete attempts to use Goofy's cat for his own purposes, and so tells Goofy that the cat is allergic to the paint on his house -- in fact, that the cat is allergic to every color but chartreuse, and "Who wants a chartreuse house?" Goofy immediately begins to paint his house the color.
In the television show Private Practice, Cooper Freedman admits that charteuse is his favorite color because he likes the sound of the word.
Make Mine Chartreuse, which appeared in 1987, was one of the Shades of Love made for TV movies that appeared on Canadian TV in the 1980s.

Traffic

Chartreuse (traditional) (sometimes fluorescent) has been used in several cities, including Spokane, Washington, for school zone signs.

Vexillology

When Bharatpur was a princely state, it was the only political entity ever to have a traditional chartreuse (chartreuse yellow) colored flag. [19]
