A kenning (Old Norse kenning [cʰɛnːiŋg], Modern Icelandic pronunciation [cʰɛnːiŋk]) is a circumlocution used instead of an ordinary noun in Old Norse, Old English and later Icelandic poetry.
This list does not pretend to be comprehensive. Kennings for a particular character are listed in that character's article. For example, the Odin article links to a list of names of Odin, which include kennings. Only a few examples of Odin's kennings are given here. For a scholarly list of kennings see Meissner's Die Kenningar der Skalden (1921) or a good edition of Snorri Sturluson Skáldskaparmál
