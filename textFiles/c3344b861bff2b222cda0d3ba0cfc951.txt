if (wgNotice != '') document.writeln(wgNotice); List of English words of Persian origin

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
As Indo-European languages, English and Persian have many words of common Proto-Indo-European origin, and many of these cognate words often have similar forms. Examples of these include: English (Mother) and Persian (Mādar), English (Father) and Persian (Pedar), English (Daughter) and Persian (Dokhtar), English (Sister) and Persian (Khwāhar) and English (Brother) and Persian (Barādar). However, this article will be concerned with loanwords, that is, words in English that derive from Persian, either directly, or more often, via one or more intermediary languages.
Many words of Persian origin have made their way into the English language through different, often circuitous, routes. Some of them, such as "paradise", date to cultural contacts between the Persians and the ancient Greeks or Romans and through Greek and Latin found their way to English. Persian as the second important language of Islam has influenced many languages in the Muslim world, and its words have found their way beyond the Muslim world.
Persia remained largely impenetrable to English-speaking travelers well into the 19th century. Persia was protected from Europe by overland trade routes that passed through territory inhospitable to foreigners, while trade at Persian ports in the Persian Gulf was in the hands of locals. In contrast, intrepid English traders operated in Mediterranean seaports of the Levant from the 1570s, and some vocabulary describing features of Ottoman culture found their way into the English language. Thus many words in the list below, though originally from Persian, arrived in English through the intermediary of Ottoman Turkish language.
Many words also came into English through Hindustani during the British Raj. Persian was the lingua franca of India before British rule.
Other words of Persian origin found their way into European languages— and eventually reached English at second-hand— through the Moorish-Christian cultural interface in the Iberian peninsula during the Middle Ages thus being transmitted through Arabic.

Kamboh
Etymology: Unabridged Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines Kamboh as "a member of a low caste in the Punjab engaged chiefly in agriculture".[208] This definition of Webster for Kamboh is based on a Persian proverb, reportedly of modern origin, according to which, the Afghans, the Kambohs and the Kashmiris are all rogues. This proverb, though very popular, also has several versions, across the length and breadth of the north-west region, some of which name the Sindis and/or the Jatts in place of Kambohs.[209] According to H. Blochman, this proverb is of recent origin since it was indeed a matter of honour to belong to the Kamboh lineage during the reigns of Mughal emperors like Akbar and Jahangir etc.[210][211][212] According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the Sayyids and the Kambohs, from among the Indians, were specially favored for high civil and military positions during muslim rule in India.[213]


The Kambohs are modern representatives of ancient Kambojas (q.v.),[214] a famous Kshatriya (warrior) clan of Indo-Iranian affinities[215] who find numerous references in ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts as well as in many ancient inscriptions, including those of king Ashoka.
Numerous Indologists have connected name Kamboja to royal name Cambyses or Kambujiya (q.v.) of the Old Persian Inscriptions.[216]


The Manusmriti,[217] and Indian epic Mahabharata[218] etc. attest that the Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas etc were originally noble Kshatriyas, but on account of their defiance of Brahmanical authority and their refusal to follow Hindu rituals & codes of conduct, these foreign conquerors were socially punished by the wrathful Brahmananical clergy who assigned them to a degenerate Kshatriya status (i.e. vrishaltam) in the Brahmanical caste system of India.[219][220] Brahmanical text Harivamsa[221] and numerous Puranas[222] also attest that the Kambojas, Yavanas, Sakas, Pahlavas etc were originally high-class Kshatriyas, but it was Vedic king Sagara, the ruler of Kosala, who had forbidden these invaders from performing "Svadhyayas" and "Vasatkaras" (Vedic rituals) and thereby, divested them off their noble Kshatriya status, because these Kshatriyas had wrested Kosala kingdom from his father, king Bahu.[223] Harivamsa rather, describes these Kshatriya invaders as Kshatriya pungavas i, e foremost among the Kshatriyas. Bhishama Parava of Mahabharata delineates the Kamboja lineage as a very high lineage.[224] Bombay Gazetteer maintains that the Kambojas etc lost their original high Kshatriya status because of their famed staunchness to Buddhism over Brahmanism.[225] Dr Romila Thapar maintains that the Kamboj etc clans lost their noble Kshatriya status because of their switching to republican constitution.[226]
A section of Kambojas or Kambohs ruled in Saurashtra, Bengal, and also colonised Sri Lanka & Cambodia. See: Kamboja Colonists of Sri Lanka & Kambojas and Kambodia.

Agar kahat ul rijal uftad, azeshan uns kamgiri
Eke Afghan, doyam Kamboh soyam badzat Kashmiri|
(Roebuck’s Oriental Proverbs, Part I. p. 99).

Trans: Of the Afghan, Kamboh and rascal Kashmiri, all three are rogues (degraded Kshatriyas). However, Richard F. Burton (Arabian Nights, Vol. 10, pp. 178-219) presents this proverb in the following form:

Agar kaht-i-mardurn uftad, az ín sih jins kam gírí;
Eki Afghán, dovvum Sindí,siyyum badjins-i-Kashmírí:

Trans: Of the Afghan, Sindi and rascal Kashmiri, all three are rogues (degraded kshatriyas).

{Note that for "Kamboh, Richard F. Burton presents Sindi. Others vary the saying ad libitum}

Yet, in another version of the same proverb, the three rogues stated are the Sindis, the Jats and the Kashmiris (See: Lady Burton, Arabian Nights, Vol IV, p 92; Also: Tribes and Castes of North-western Province and Oudh, p 120, William Crooke).
