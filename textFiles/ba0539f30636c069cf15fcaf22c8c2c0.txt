World Game, sometimes called the World Peace Game, is an alternative to war games. The playing of World Game was an idea proposed by Buckminster Fuller. The idea was to "make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone."
He publicly proposed the concept in 1961 as the core curriculum at the (then new) Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Fuller proposed it again in 1964 for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec.
In a preamble to World Game documents released in 1970, Fuller identified it very closely with his 'Guinea Pig 'B' experiment' and his 'Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science' lifework. He claimed intellectual property rights as well to control what he considered to be misapplication of his idea by others. He also claimed he had been playing it 'longhand' without the assistance of computers since 1927.
In 1972, the World Game Institute was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Fuller, Medard Gabel, Howard Brown and others.
In 2001, a for-profit educational company named 'O. S. Earth' purchased the principal assets of the World Game Institute and has been offering a Global Simulation Workshop that is claimed to be a 'direct descendant of Buckminster Fuller's famous World Game.' [1]
