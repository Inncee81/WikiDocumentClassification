Evernote is a software application that allows users to capture information of various types, including text notes, mobile phone snapshots, printed and handwritten text within images, web clips, and digital ink. All data added to Evernote are run through a series of recognizers that make any text within the various note formats searchable. The application uses a continuous "roll of paper" metaphor for its user interface. Additionally, users may create folders, categories and notebooks. Users can also tag notes.
For capturing content beyond direct text and digital ink input, Evernote uses a system of Clippers (Web, Mail, and Universal Clippers) and supports drag-and-drop, cut, copy, and paste, and import/auto-import capabilities.
AI technologies used in the Evernote application for recognition, indexing and search purpose include AIR (Advanced Image Recognition) for search of typed and handwritten text in images captured on camera phone or scanner; and ANR (Advanced Notes Recognition) for search in digital ink notes captured on pen-enabled devices like Pocket PC, Tablet PC, Ultra-Mobile PC, and digital paper, amongst others. AIR technology is optimized for recognition of low quality images. In contrast to AIR, ANR technology provides not only search capability, but also outputs handwriting recognition results for ink notes; ANR can also automatically smooth and align freehand shapes and charts.
Evernote categories include Automatic, Manual and Keyword (Saved Searches). Categories are automatically assigned to notes based on attributes such as content type, date range, etc.
Evernote's web-based version of the software was updated to version 3.0 in an open beta on June 24, 2008.[1]
Evernote is a competitor of Microsoft OneNote on Windows and Barebones Software's Yojimbo, Journler, and Circus Ponies NoteBook on Macintosh.
