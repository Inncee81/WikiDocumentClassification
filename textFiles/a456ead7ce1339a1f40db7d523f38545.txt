Windows Mobile


Windows Mobile is a compact operating system combined with a suite of basic applications for mobile devices based on the Microsoft Win32 API. Devices that run Windows Mobile include Pocket PCs, Smartphones, Portable Media Centers, and on-board computers for certain automobiles. It is designed to be somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows, feature-wise and aesthetically. Additionally, third-party software development is available for Windows Mobile. Originally appearing as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system, Windows Mobile has been updated several times, with the current version being Windows Mobile 6.1 and a future 6.5 release planned for release toward the end of 2009.
Microsoft projected in 2008 that shipments of devices with Windows Mobile will increase from 11 million to 20 million units, but it missed its initial goal in only selling 18 million licenses citing the delayed launch of certain smartphones.[citation needed] Windows Mobile's market share as an operating system for smartphones worldwide has fallen from 23% in 2004 down to 12% in 2008.[1] Windows Mobile now has a worldwide smartphone market share of 14%.[2] Microsoft licenses Windows Mobile to four out of the world's five largest mobile phone manufacturers, with Nokia being the other.[3]. Some current estimates suggest that 80% of the 50 million Windows Mobile devices made have been built by one contract manufacturing group, HTC, which makes handsets as for several major companies under their brands, as well as under its own brand. [4] However, in February 2009 Microsoft signed a deal with the third largest mobile phone maker, LG Electronics, to license Windows Mobile on 50 upcoming LG smartphone models.[5]

[edit] Hardware platforms
See also: List of Windows Mobile devices
Windows Mobile runs on multiple hardware platforms including Pocket PCs, smartphones, Portable Media Center, and automobiles. These hardware platforms did not always exist from the inception of Windows Mobile.




An O2 Pocket PC phone






A Smartphone (T-Mobile Dash)






A Portable Media Center



[edit] Pocket PC
Main article: Pocket PC
The Pocket PC was the original intended platform for the Windows Mobile operating system. These devices consisted of both standalone Pocket PC devices without mobile phone capabilities, and those that included mobile phone capabilities. The most current name of Windows Mobile intended for use on Pocket PCs is officially "Windows Mobile 6 Professional" for devices with mobile phone capabilities and "Windows Mobile 6 Classic" for devices without mobile phone capabilities.

[edit] Smartphone
Main article: Smartphone
The Smartphone became the next hardware platform after the Pocket PC to run Windows Mobile, and debuted with the release of Pocket PC 2002. Although in the broad sense of the term "Smartphone", both Pocket PC phones and Microsoft branded Smartphones each fit into this category, it should be noted that Microsoft's use of the term "Smartphone" includes only more specific hardware devices that differ from Pocket PC phones. Such Smartphones were originally designed without touchscreens, intended to be operated more efficiently with only one hand, and typically had lower resolution displays than Pocket PCs. Microsoft's focus for the Smartphone platform was to create a device that functioned well as a phone and data device in a more integrated manner.[6] The current name of Windows Mobile intended for use on Smartphones is officially "Windows Mobile 6 Standard".

[edit] Portable Media Center
Main article: Portable Media Center
The Portable Media Center was a device that focused on integration with Microsoft's Windows Media Center and Windows Media Player to allow users to carry their media libraries with them on the go. The Portable Media Center was officially introduced in 2004, and ran a modified version of Windows Mobile. These devices became the predecessor to Microsoft's Zune, and after 2006 Microsoft discontinued the project in favor of the latter.

[edit] Automobiles
See also: Ford SYNC
"Windows Mobile for Automotive" is the name for Microsoft's operating system that facilitates multiple functions in automobiles including communication, entertainment, information systems.[7] Windows Mobile for use in automobiles is the latest platform for the operating system, and was introduced by Microsoft in February 2006 at the Geneva International Motor Show.[8] Windows Mobile for Automotive comes in two different versions. The Basic version includes a Bluetooth connectivity and USB interface for music playback. The Standard version includes this also, but additionally it features a built-in GPS, GSM phone, and security features. These systems are more widely known as SYNC. The Windows Mobile for Automotive hardware1 specification includes a 300 MHz ARM processor, 32 MB of RAM, and a microphone.[7]

[edit] Versions

[edit] Pocket PC 2000




Typical Pocket PC 2000 Today Screen.


Pocket PC 2000, originally codenamed "Rapier",[9] was released on April 19, 2000, and was based on Windows CE 3.0. It was the debut of what was later dubbed the Windows Mobile operating system, and meant to be a successor to the operating system aboard Palm-Size PCs. Backwards compatibility was retained with such Palm-Size PC applications. Pocket PC 2000 was intended mainly for Pocket PC devices, however several Palm-Size PC devices had the ability to be updated as well. In addition, several Pocket PC 2000 phones were released, however the Smartphone hardware platform was not yet created. The only resolution supported by this release was 240 x 320 (QVGA). Removable storage card formats that were supported were CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard. At this time Pocket PC devices had not been standardized with a specific CPU architecture. As a result, Pocket PC 2000 was released on multiple CPU architectures; SH-3, MIPS, and ARM.
Aesthetically, the original Pocket PC operating system was similar to Windows 98, Windows Me, and Windows 2000 operating systems.
Features/built-in applications for Pocket PC 2000 included the following:[10]

Pocket Office

Pocket Word
Pocket Excel
Pocket Outlook


Pocket Internet Explorer
Windows Media Player

[edit] Pocket PC 2002




Typical Pocket PC 2002 Today Screen.


Pocket PC 2002, originally codenamed "Merlin",[9] was released in October 2001. Like Pocket PC 2000, it was powered by Windows CE 3.0. Although targeted mainly for 240 × 320 (QVGA) Pocket PC devices, Pocket PC 2002 was also used for Pocket PC phones, and for the first time, Smartphones.[11] These Pocket PC 2002 Smartphones were mainly GSM devices. With future releases, the Pocket PC and Smartphone lines would increasingly collide as the licensing terms were relaxed allowing OEMs to take advantage of more innovative, individual design ideas. Aesthetically, Pocket PC 2002 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows XP.
New features/built-in applications included the following:[12][13][14][15]

Enhanced UI with theme support
Spell checker and Word count tool in Pocket Word
Savable downloads and WAP in Pocket Internet Explorer

[edit] Windows Mobile 2003




Typical Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Today Screen


Windows Mobile 2003, originally codenamed "Ozone",[9] was released on June 23, 2003, and was the first release under the Windows Mobile banner. It came in four editions: "Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Premium Edition", "Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Professional Edition", "Windows Mobile 2003 for Smartphone" and "Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition". The last was designed especially for Pocket PCs which include phone functionalities. The Professional Edition was used in Pocket PC budget models. It lacked a number of features that were in the Premium Edition, such as a client for L2TP/IPsec VPNs. Windows Mobile 2003 was powered by Windows CE 4.20.
New features/built-in applications included the following:[16]

Support for add-on keyboards

[edit] Windows Mobile 2003 SE
Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition, also known as "Windows Mobile 2003 SE", was released on March 24, 2004 and first offered on the Dell Axim x30. This was the last version which allowed users to backup and restore an entire device through ActiveSync.
New features/built-in applications included the following:

Portrait and Landscape switching for Pocket PCs
Single-Column layout in Pocket Internet Explorer
VGA (640×480), 176х220, 240x240, 480x480 Screen resolution

[edit] Windows Mobile 5




Typical Windows Mobile 5.0 for Pocket PC Today Screen


Windows Mobile 5.0, originally codenamed "Magneto",[9] was released at Microsoft's Mobile and Embedded Developers Conference 2005 in Las Vegas, May 9–May 12, 2005. Microsoft plans to offer mainstream support for Windows Mobile 5 through October 12, 2010, and extended support through October 13, 2015.[17] It was first offered on the Dell Axim x51. It used the .NET Compact Framework 1.0 SP3 — an environment for programs based on .NET.

Windows Mobile 5.0 included Microsoft Exchange Server "push" functionality improvements that worked with Exchange 2003 SP2.[18] The "push" functionality also required vendor/device support[19] With AKU2 software upgrades all WM 5.0 devices supported DirectPush.
WM 5.0 featured increased battery life due to Persistent storage capability. Previously up to 50% (enough for 72 hours of storage) of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile RAM. This continued the trend of Windows-based devices moving from using RAM as their primary storage medium to the use of a combination of RAM and flash memory (in use, there's no distinction between the two apparent to the user). Programs and frequently accessed data run in RAM, while most storage is in the flash memory. The OS seamlessly moves data between the two as needed. Everything is backed up in the flash memory, so unlike previous devices, WM5 devices don't lose any data if power is lost.
With Windows Mobile 5.0, OS updates were released as Adaptation kit upgrades.

AKU3.5 is the most current release. In performance, it was generally much slower and less stable than the previous WM2003SE, especially on older devices "upgraded" to WM5 but even on native WM5 devices.[citation needed]
Further new features and built-in applications included:

New version of Office called "Office Mobile"

PowerPoint Mobile
Graphing capability in Excel Mobile
Tables and graphics insertion in Word Mobile


Windows Media Player 10 Mobile
Photo Caller ID
DirectShow support
Picture and Video package, which converged the management of videos and pictures
Enhanced Bluetooth support
Global Positioning System (GPS) management interface
Default QWERTY keyboard-support
Error reporting facility similar to that present in desktop and server Windows systems
ActiveSync 4.2 with 15% increased synchronization speed


[edit] Windows Mobile 6




Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional Today Screen






Windows Mobile 6.1 Standard Today Screen


Windows Mobile 6, formerly codenamed "Crossbow",[9] was released on February 12, 2007[20] at the 3GSM World Congress 2007. It comes in three different versions: "Windows Mobile 6 Standard" for Smartphones (phones without touchscreens), "Windows Mobile 6 Professional" for Pocket PCs with phone functionality, and "Windows Mobile 6 Classic" for Pocket PCs without cellular radios.[21]
Windows Mobile 6 is powered by Windows CE 5.0 (version 5.2) and is strongly linked to Windows Live and Exchange 2007 products. Windows Mobile 6 Standard was first offered on the Orange's SPV E650,[22] while Windows Mobile 6 Professional was first offered on the O2's Xda Terra.[23] Aesthetically, Windows Mobile 6 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released Windows Vista. Functionally, it works much like Windows Mobile 5, but with much better stability.
New features/built-in applications include the following:[24]

320x320 and 800x480 (WVGA) screen resolution support
Office Mobile support for Smartphones
Operating System Live Update[25]
Improved Remote Desktop access[26](Available for only certain Pocket PCs)[27]
VoIP (Internet calling) support with AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancelling) and MSRT Audio Codec
Windows Live for Windows Mobile[28]
Customer Feedback option[29]
Enhanced Microsoft Bluetooth Stack
Storage Card Encryption (encryption keys are lost if device is cold-booted).
Smartfilter for searching within programs
Improved Internet Sharing
HTML email support in Outlook Mobile
Search ability for contacts in an Exchange Server Address Book
AJAX, JavaScript, and XMLDOM support on Internet Explorer Mobile
Out of Office Replies with Microsoft Exchange 2007
Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA) support for select operators
Server Search on Microsoft Exchange 2007
.NET Compact Framework v2 SP2 Preinstalled in ROM
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition Preinstalled in ROM
OneNote Mobile as a companion to Microsoft Office OneNote
Office Mobile 6.1 announced[30] with support for Office 2007 document formats (pptx, docx, xlsx).


[edit] Windows Mobile 6.1
Windows Mobile 6.1 was announced April 1, 2008. It is a minor upgrade to the existing Windows Mobile 6 platform which brings with it various performance enhancements, a redesigned Home screen featuring horizontal tiles that expand on clicking to display more information, although this new home screen is featured only on Windows Mobile Standard edition. This feature was inexplicably left out of the Professional edition.[31] Several other improvements such as threaded SMS, full page zooming in IE and 'Domain Enroll' have also been added, along with a "mobile" version of the Microsoft OneNote program and an interactive "Getting Started" wizard. Domain Enroll is functionality to connect the device to System Center Mobile Device Manager 2008, a product to manage mobile devices.[32] There are other differences as well. The most prominent difference for the user is that the Standard version (like earlier versions) still creates automatic links for telephone numbers in Tasks and Appointments, which allows for the easy (and safe while driving) click and dial of stored telephone numbers within these Outlook items. For some reason, the Professional version has eliminated this important feature. Windows Mobile 6.1 also featured improved bandwidth efficiency in its push-email protocol "Activesync" of "upto 40%"[33], this reduced data usage was the cause of considerably improved battery life in many devices.
Aside from the visual and feature distinctions, the underlying CE versions can be used to differentiate WM6.0 from WM 6.1. The version of Windows CE in WM 6.0 is 5.2.*, with the final number being a 4 digit build ID (eg. 5.2.1622 on HTC Wing). In WM 6.1, the CE version is 5.2.* with a 5 digit build number (eg. 5.2.19216 on Palm Treo 800w).

[edit] Windows Mobile 6.5




Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional build 6.5.21193


Initially confirmed by Steve Ballmer[34], version 6.5 will be a somewhat minor upgrade to the existing Windows Mobile platform that is expected to be released to manufacturers by April '09, and the first devices are expected by to debut later during September '09.[35] Despite being an incremental update however, it is said to include significant new added features.[36] It will also include the new Internet Explorer Mobile browser dubbed IE "6 On 6".[37] Microsoft unveiled this version at the 2009 Mobile World Congress in February[38], and Motorola expects to release a phone running Windows Mobile 6.5 in the second half of 2009.[36] Devices running this version onwards will be marketed as "Windows phones". Along with Windows mobile 6.5, Microsoft announced several Cloud computing services codenamed "SkyBox","SkyLine","SkyMarket".[39] "SkyBox" has been confirmed as My Phone[40], while "SkyMarket" has been confirmed as Windows Marketplace for Mobile.[41] The home screen has been redesigned to match that of version 6.1 standard, and this version will be designed mainly for easier finger usage.[42] Microsoft also plans to bring some form of Zune software or functionality to this version sometime later in 2009.[43]

[edit] Future versions





This article or section contains information about scheduled or expected future software.
The content may change as the software release approaches and more information becomes available.






[edit] Windows Mobile 7
Codenamed "Photon"[44], Windows Mobile 7 is a major upgrade planned for release in 2010[45][46], and a beta is planned to be released to testers during november 2009.[47][48] It was initially intended to be released during 2009, but several delays caused Microsoft to release 6.5 instead as a placeholder.[49] Not much else is known about the release, though leaked information suggests a revamped UI, multi-touch and motion-related features.[50] Companies such as MWg and HTC are expected to release Windows Mobile Professional devices supporting this version.[51][52] Features include redesigned interface, new Office Mobile version, next Internet Explorer Mobile, accelerometer functionality with interface (gestures), new media player version.[53] Microsoft has somewhat confirmed the leaks, showing the homescreen during a commercial of their Live Mesh software operating on what appears to be an HTC Touch Dual.[54] Windows Mobile 7 will incorporate elements of Windows Mobile 6.5 (Homescreen), and Zune.[55]

[edit] Software development
Third-party software development is available for the Windows Mobile operating system. There are several options for developers to use when deploying a mobile application. This includes writing native code with Visual C++, writing Managed code that works with the .NET Compact Framework, or Server-side code that can be deployed using Internet Explorer Mobile or a mobile client on the user's device. The .NET Compact Framework is actually a subset of the .NET Framework and hence shares many components with software development on desktop clients, application servers, and web servers which have the .NET Framework installed, thus integrating networked computing space (a.k.a. "The Cloud")[56].
Microsoft typically releases Windows Mobile Software development kits (SDKs) that work in conjunction with their Visual Studio development environment. These SDKs include emulator images for developers to test and debug their applications while writing them. Microsoft also distributes Visual Studio 2008 / 2005 Professional Editions, and server / database counterparts to students as downloads free of charge via its DreamSpark program.[57]
Developer communities have used the SDK to port later versions of Windows Mobile to older devices and making the OS images available for free, thus providing the devices with the current feature set. Microsoft has tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask developers to take their OS images off the net, which in turn raised discussions.[58] At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free. [59]
NS Basic provides an alternative development environment. It allows for development on the desktop, which is then downloaded to the device, as well as development on the actual device itself. Other 3rd party development tools such as Basic4ppc use the .NET Compact Framework. Basic4ppc applications can be developed on both the desktop and on the device itself.[60]
Prior to the release of Windows Mobile 2003, third-party software was developed using Microsoft's eMbedded Visual Tools, eMbedded Visual Basic (eVB) and eMbedded Visual C (eVC).[61] eVB programs can usually be converted fairly easily to NS Basic/CE.[62]
There is also a Python port named PythonCE.
Satellite Forms is a RAD tool that can produce Windows Mobile compatible applications that use an RDK runtime engine. Extension libraries extend the functionality for various hardware.
