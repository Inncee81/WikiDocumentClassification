The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pick-up Artists is a non-fiction book written by investigative reporter Neil Strauss as a chronicle of his journey in the seduction community as a pickup artist.
The book was featured on the New York Times Bestseller List for two months after its release in September 2005, reaching prominence again in 2007 during the broadcast of the hit series, VH1's The Pick-Up Artist. In its original published hardcover format, the book was covered in black leather and bookmarked with red satin, similar to some printings of the Christian Bible. Despite the reputation that The Game has received as an expose on the seduction community, it was primarily written as an autobiographical work.
