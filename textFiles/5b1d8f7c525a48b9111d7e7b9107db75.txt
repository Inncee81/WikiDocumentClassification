Alchemic symbols in Torbern Bergman's 1775 Dissertation on Elective Affinities.


Alchemic symbols, originally devised as part of the protoscience of alchemy, were used to denote some elements and some compounds until the 18th century. Note that while notation like this was mostly standardized, style and symbol varied between alchemists, so this page lists the most common.

[edit] Seven Planetary Metals
Main articles: Classical planets in Western alchemy and Planets in astrology




Astrological symbols/glyphs representing the Sun, Moon, Pluto and planets, along with the Earth, in Western astrology.


Planetary metals were "dominated" or "ruled" by one of the seven planets known by the ancients. Although they occasionally have a symbol of their own (denoted by also:), they were usually symbolized by the planet's symbol.

Gold dominated by Sol ☉ ☼ (  )
Silver dominated by Luna ☽ (  )
Copper dominated by Venus ♀ (also:  )
Iron dominated by Mars ♂ (  )
Tin dominated by Jupiter ♃ (  )
Mercury (quicksilver) dominated by Mercury ☿ (  )
Lead dominated by Saturn ♄ (  )

The planets Uranus and Neptune and the dwarf planet Pluto were discovered after the time alchemy had been largely replaced by chemistry, and are not part of traditional Alchemical symbols. Some modern alchemists consider the symbols for these planets to represent the radioactive metals uranium, neptunium and plutonium, respectively. Also, the Monas Hieroglyphica is an alchemical symbol devised by John Dee as a combination of the plantery metal glyphs.
