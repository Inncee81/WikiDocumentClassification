[edit] Synopsis
Eureka takes place in a high tech community of the same name, located somewhere in the Pacific Northwest (implied to be Oregon, due to the presence of Oregon maps and flags.) and inhabited entirely by brilliant scientists working on new scientific advancements for the United States government that frequently go disastrously awry. The town's existence and location are closely guarded secrets.
U.S. Marshal Jack Carter stumbles upon Eureka while transporting a fugitive prisoner — his own rebellious teenage daughter Zoe — back to her mother's home in Los Angeles, California. When a faulty experiment cripples the sheriff of Eureka, Carter finds himself quickly chosen to fill the vacancy. Despite not being a genius like most members of the town, Jack Carter's ability to connect to others repeatedly saves Eureka, and indeed the entire world, from one would-be disaster after another.

[edit] Characters

Colin Ferguson as Sheriff Jack Carter, a U.S. Marshal who reluctantly ends up as Sheriff of Eureka. Jack is consistently dumbfounded by the wonders Eureka produces, as well as their propensity to produce things that often threaten the entire town, if not the world. Despite being an average man in a town full of geniuses, Jack's admittedly simplistic ideas often save the day; he contrasts with the other residents of Eureka, who tend to over-complicate things. Jack is in love with Allison Blake, current director of Global Dynamics, and, as of the middle of season 3, is currently unemployed after being fired by General Mansfield.
Salli Richardson-Whitfield as Dr. Allison Blake, a Department of Defense agent who acts as the liaison between Eureka and the federal government, and later becomes the director of Global Dynamics. She is always at the forefront of any dilemma that might arise.
Jordan Hinson as Zoe Carter, Jack's rebellious teenage daughter. Unlike her father, she is intelligent enough to keep up with the town's residents (her IQ is 157), yet like her father, possesses the street smarts that most of the town's residents do not.
Joe Morton as Dr. Henry Deacon, the town jack-of-all-trades. Henry's assistance is often invaluable in defusing the situations the experiments in town create. So much so that in the middle of season 3, he was elected mayor as a write-in candidate.
Ed Quinn as Dr. Nathan Stark, one of Eureka's top scientists who is modeled after Tony Stark[1]. He and Jack are frequently at odds, though both respect the other. He was formerly married to Allison, and they rekindled their relationship in the second season. They were supposed to get remarried in the third season, but he died while saving the world from a time paradox on the day of their wedding.
Erica Cerra as Deputy Jo Lupo, another of the town's few nongenius residents. Jo is a tough, no-nonsense cop who loves her gun collection (maybe a little bit too much).
Neil Grayston as Dr. Douglas Fargo, an average scientist who more often than not ends up a victim of the disasters that befall the town.
Debrah Farentino as Dr. Beverly Barlowe, the town psychiatrist who secretly works for a conglomerate of business interests that wish to exploit Eureka's innovations.
Matt Frewer as Dr. Jim Taggart, a somewhat eccentric animal expert.
Chris Gauthier as Vincent, the owner of Cafe Diem. He prides himself on being able to make anything his customers ask for. It is implied in at least two episodes that Vincent is gay. [2]
Niall Matter as Zane Donovan, a rebellious genius recruited in the second season after being arrested for fraud. He is said to have caused the New York Stock Exchange to crash; he denies the allegations. He develops a relationship with Jo Lupo shortly after he arrives in town.
Frances Fisher as Eva Thorne, a corporate fixer hired to make Eureka more profitable, which she mainly accomplishes by downsizing. She seems to have an ulterior motive involving an underground military base built before Eureka was founded.
Barclay Hope as General Mansfield, an army general who frequently visits Eureka to check up on government projects, or to enforce martial law when experiments get out of control.
Jaime Ray Newman as Dr. Tess Fontana, a new employee at Global Dynamics coming in season 3. [3]


[edit] Episodes
Main article: List of Eureka episodes
The episodes of season one were not aired in the order intended by the show's creators. This is suggested by the episodes' production numbers which are displayed on the SCI FI's Eureka website next to episode titles quite often. There are some small inconsistencies when watched closely, but such inconsistencies are minimal and were intentionally controlled. In podcast commentaries with the show's creators and star Colin Ferguson, they confirm that the production order is in fact the order in which they intended the show to air, but the network executives changed the order to try and place stronger episodes earlier in the run to help attract viewers. The creators were able to make minor changes in editing and sometimes dubbed dialogue in later episodes (for instance, they removed the explicit mention of Zoe's first day at school) to try to eliminate audience confusion.
Eureka was originally planned as an animated series.[4]
The remaining episodes of season 3 will begin airing July 10, 2009.[5]

[edit] Ratings
The series premiere garnered high ratings, with 4.1 million people tuning in. Eureka was also the top rated cable program for that Tuesday night, and was the highest-rated series launch in SCI FI's fourteen-year history.[6] The season two premiere drew 2.5 million viewers, making it the top-rated cable program of the day.[7]
For calendar-year 2008 on a first-run basis, the series delivered 1.42 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic. [2]

[edit] Critical reaction
Critical Reaction was mixed, with general praise for the premise, but overall middling reaction to the writing of the pilot.
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer:

It's all very quirky. Too quirky, maybe, for an audience that is used to spaceships, robots, and explosions. Though every episode promises an "aha!" moment based in quantum physics and obscure scientific laws, this world is relatively flat, conceptually speaking, in comparison to the complexity woven into series such as Stargate SG-1 and Battlestar Galactica. This does not mean Eureka is a complete waste of time. Not at all. The characters are fun, Ferguson is believable and pleasant, the script is solidly constructed, and the visuals are slickly produced. All in all, it's a sweet series and probably not long for this world.[8]

The New York Daily News:

With its playful new series "Eureka," set in the Pacific Northwest and telling the story of an outsider who comes to explore, and settle in, a remote town full of eccentrics, Sci-Fi Channel isn't just inviting comparisons to "Twin Peaks" and "Northern Exposure." It's demanding them. But co-creators Andrew Cosby and Jaime Paglia hold up to them pretty well. "Eureka" has a premise, a cast and a plot that make it one of the TV treats of the summer. The folks at Sci-Fi Channel clearly intended to reinvent the summer TV series here, and come up with something breezy and fun. And "Eureka" - they've done it!


[edit] Awards
Eureka was nominated for a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. The other nominees were Battlestar Galactica (the winner), Grey's Anatomy, Heroes, and Rome.[9]
