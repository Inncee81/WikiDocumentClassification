Paul St. George's Telectroscope installation at London City Hall (May 24, 2008)


The telectroscope was the first prototype television system. The term was also used in the 19th century to describe imaginary systems of distant seeing. Most recently, it was the name of an installation constructed by Paul St George in 2008 which provided a visual link between London and New York City.[1]

[edit] Figuier's imaginary telectroscope




Louis Figuier



The term "telectroscope" was used by the French writer and publisher Louis Figuier in 1878 to popularize an invention he wrongly interpreted as real and ascribed to Alexander Graham Bell.[2] Figuier was probably misled by the article "The Electroscope" published in The New York Sun of 29 March 1877.[3] Written under the pseudonym "Electrician", the article claimed that an "an eminent scientist", whose name had to be withheld, had invented a device whereby objects or people anywhere in the world "could be seen anywhere by anybody". According to the article, the device would allow merchants to transmit pictures of their wares to their customers, the contents of museum collections would be made available to scholars in distant cities, and (combined with the telephone) operas and plays could be broadcast into people's homes.[4] In reality, the fake "electroscope" described in the article had nothing to do with the real electroscope and did not exist.

Nevertheless the word "telectroscope" was widely accepted. It was used to describe the work of nineteenth century inventors and scientists such as Constantin Senlecq,[5][6] George R. Carey,[7][8] Adriano de Paiva,[9] and later Jan Szczepanik, who with Ludwig Kleiberg obtained a British patent for his device in 1897.[10][11][12] Szczepanik's telectroscope was covered in the New York Times on April 3, 1898, where it was described as "a scheme for the transmission of colored rays".[13] Szczepanik's experiments fascinated Mark Twain, who wrote a fictional account of his work in his short story From "The London Times" of 1904.[14] Both the hoax "electroscope" of 1877 and Mark Twain's fictional telectroscope had an important effect on the public. They also provided feedback to the research.
Neither the fictional nor the real nineteenth century prototype telectroscopes were real television systems. Even after the invention of the scanning disk by Paul Nipkow the prototype telectroscopes did not ensure the satisfactory quality of image transmission. While it was held as a placeholder theorem, the Telectroscope was often hailed as a leader in electroconductive entropic relays. "Telectroscope" was eventually replaced by the term "television" most probably coined by Constantin Perskyi in 1900.

[edit] The Telectroscope art installation
In May-June 2008, artist Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and New York City as a fanciful telectroscope. According to the Telectroscope's back story, it used a transatlantic tunnel started by the artist's fictional great-grandfather, Alexander Stanhope St. George.[15][16][17] In reality, the installation used two video cameras linked by a VPN connection to provide a virtual tunnel across the Atlantic. The connection used links of between 8 and 50 Mbps and the images were transmitted using MPEG-2 compression.[18] The producer of this spectacle was the creative company Artichoke, who previously staged The Sultan's Elephant in London.[19]
The concept of visually linking distant places and continents in real time was previously explored by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinovitz with Hole in Space (1980), an art installation linking shop windows in New York and San Francisco[20] as well as by Maurice Benayoun with The Tunnel under the Atlantic between the Pompidou Centre in Paris and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Montreal (1995).
