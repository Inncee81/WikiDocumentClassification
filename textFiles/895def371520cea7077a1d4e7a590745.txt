The NUMB3RS intertitle and logo


Numb3rs (pronounced like the word "numbers") is an American television series produced by brothers Ridley and Tony Scott. It premiered on CBS on Friday, January 23, 2005 at 10:00 pm with its pilot episode. The series is set in Los Angeles, California, and follows the stories of an Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) team and a mathematics professor, focusing on relationships between FBI Special Agent In Charge Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), his brother Professor Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by Don's team and mathematically described by Charlie. The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics are almost always crucial to solving the crime.[1]
As of the current date, 5 seasons consisting of 102 episodes have been broadcast. The first season, a mid-season replacement for Dr. Vegas,[2] was the shortest of the five, and spanned 13 episodes from January to May 2005. Seasons two and three aired from September to May of the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons respectively, but season four was cut short by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Twelve episodes were originally produced and aired from September 2007 to January 2008. Six more episodes were aired in April and May 2008 after the strike ended. Season 5 began airing on October 3, 2008 and will continue through May. Season six is projected to begin in early September 2009.[3] In addition to being broadcast on television, Numb3rs is available on DVD. Seasons one, two, three, and four have been released for Region 1, and seasons one, two, and three have been released for Regions 2 and 4. Individual episodes of Numb3rs can also be purchased by registered members of the US iTunes Store[4] and as video on demand from Amazon Unbox.[5] CBS also streams recently broadcast episodes on its website.[6]
