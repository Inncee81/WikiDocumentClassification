[edit] Programme description
In Our Time is a discussion programme hosted since 1998 by Melvyn Bragg on BBC Radio 4 in the United Kingdom, described as a series investigating the "history of ideas". The series covers many different subjects from history, religion, philosophy, the arts or science, one of which is explored in each programme with the help of three experts on the subject. It has been produced by Charlie Taylor and James Cook.
It is normally broadcast on Thursday mornings at 9am with a shortened repeat at 9.30pm the same day; since 2005 the programme has also been made available as a podcast from the BBC website and iTunes for one week after broadcast. The series runs throughout the year except for a summer break of approximately six weeks between July and September.
The BBC website for the programme includes an archive of previous programmes, each available as streaming audio. The archive is divided into sections for the categories of science, religion, philosophy, history and culture, with another section for the programmes of the current series.

[edit] Format
The full programme lasts around 42 minutes. Melvyn Bragg starts with a summary, in about 200 words[citation needed], of the week's topic. He then introduces three specialists. Bragg appears familiar with their work - he may have read their books[original research?], and during the programme he will often refer to material which they have submitted in advance.
One of the specialists is invited to begin the proceedings, and then Bragg advances the discussion by inviting another of the guests to answer a question. This continues along a preplanned route until the forty-two minute mark is in sight. Bragg then either winds the programme up himself or allows a remark from one of the specialists to be the concluding statement.
Sometimes, in concluding, he mentions regretfully that there was no time for a particular aspect of the subject. The programme is usually live and unedited in the morning edition. This is demonstrated when one of the participants joins late but has been 'listening in the taxi on the way in'. To the listener at least, it is Bragg, as knowledgeable amateur, introducing and chairing a planned discussion about the topic. He usually succeeds in guiding it to a satisfactory conclusion. This simple structure and lack of editing allows every programme to develop in a unique way while the format remains the same.

[edit] Archive
Due to site reconstructions, the In Our Time archive is split into several sections. Programmes are arched in Realplayer or iPlayer format, but complete archives of the podcasts in the more convenient MP3 format can also be found online.
