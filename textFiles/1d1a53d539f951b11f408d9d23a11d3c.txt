Open Financial Exchange (OFX) arising from Microsoft's OFC and Intuit's Open Exchange is a data-stream format for exchanging financial information.
The OFX standard was announced on the 16 January 1997 by Microsoft, Intuit and CheckFree and was designed as a unified technical specification to converge their respective mechanisms. The specification allows for bank and application specific extensions, although only a subset is necessary to describe a financial transaction. Since the current version is a flavour of XML, it is simple to create well-formed OFX documents.
Versions 1.0–1.6 relied on SGML for data exchange whereas all versions since are XML based. According to the main OFX site: "The specification is freely licensed, allowing any software developer to design an interface that will be supported on the front-end."[1]
QFX is a proprietary variant of OFX used in Intuit's products. Confusingly, Intuit's documentation uses the term "OFX" when in reality the products only work with QFX. [2].
