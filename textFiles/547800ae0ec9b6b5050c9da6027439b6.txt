Selenium is a portable software testing framework for web applications. The tests can be written as HTML tables or coded in a number of popular programming languages and can be run directly in most modern web browsers. Selenium can be deployed on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh.
Selenium was developed by a team of programmers and testers at ThoughtWorks. It is open source software, released under the Apache 2.0 license and can be downloaded and used without charge. The latest side project is Selenium Grid, which provides a hub allowing the running of multiple Selenium tests concurrently on any number of local or remote systems, thus minimizing test execution time.

[edit] Selenium IDE
Selenium IDE is a complete Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Selenium tests (previously known as Selenium Recorder). It is implemented as a Firefox extension, and allows recording, editing, and debugging tests.
Scripts may be automatically recorded and edited manually providing autocompletion support and the ability to move commands around quickly.
Features:



Record and playback
Intelligent field selection will use IDs, names, or XPath as needed
Autocomplete for all common Selenium commands
Walk through tests
Debug and set breakpoints
Save tests as HTML, Ruby scripts, or other formats
Support for Selenium user-extensions.js file
Option to automatically assert the title of every page




[edit] Selenium Remote Control
Selenium Remote Control (RC) is a server, written in Java, that accepts commands for the browser via HTTP. RC makes it possible to write automated tests for a web application in any programming language, which allows for better integration of Selenium in existing unit test frameworks. To make writing tests easier, Selenium project currently provides client drivers for Python, Ruby, .NET, Perl, Java, and PHP. The Java driver can also be used with JavaScript (via the Rhino engine).
