From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
reStructuredText is a lightweight markup language intended to be highly readable in source format. Its formal name indicates that it is a "revised, reworked, and reinterpreted StructuredText."[1]
reStructuredText is sometimes abbreviated as RST; while sometimes abbreviated as ReST, this can create confusion with REST, an unrelated technology.
The reference parser is implemented as a component of the Docutils text processing framework in the Python programming language, but other parsers are available. It was a re-implementation and extension of the StructuredText and Setext lightweight markup systems,[2] and was meant in particular to address the Problems with StructuredText.
reStructuredText is commonly used for technical documentation, for example, in documentation of Python libraries. However, reStructuredText is suitable for a wide range of texts.
