A bildungsroman (IPA: [ˈbɪldʊŋs.roˌmaːn]; German: "novel of education") is a novelistic genre that arose during the German Enlightenment, in which the author presents the psychological, moral and social shaping of the personality of a (usually young) protagonist. An example of this would be James Joyce's Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. The term was coined by Johann Carl Simon Morgenstern.[1]

[edit] Features
The bildungsroman generally takes the following course[2]:

The protagonist grows from child to adult.
The protagonist must have a reason to embark upon his or her journey. A loss or discontent must, at an early stage, jar him or her away from their home or family setting.
The process of maturation is long, arduous and gradual, involving repeated clashes between the hero's needs and desires and the views and judgments enforced by an unbending social order. This bears some similarity to Sigmund Freud's concept of the pleasure principle versus the reality principle- a prominent example of this would be A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess
Eventually, the spirit and values of the social order become manifest in the protagonist, who is ultimately incorporated into the society. The novel ends with the protagonist's assessment of himself and his new place in that society.

Within the broader genre, an entwicklungsroman is a story of general growth rather than self-culture, an erziehungsroman focuses on training and formal education, and a künstlerroman is about the development of an artist and shows a growth of the self.
Many other genres, separate from the bildungsroman genre, can include elements of the bildungsroman as a prominent part of their story lines, while not in themselves fitting the criteria of the bildungsroman. A military story will frequently show a raw recruit receiving a baptism by fire and becoming a battle-hardened soldier, while a high-fantasy quest may show a transformation from an adolescent protagonist into an adult aware of his powers or lineage. Neither of those genres or stories, however, corresponds exactly to the bildungsroman.
