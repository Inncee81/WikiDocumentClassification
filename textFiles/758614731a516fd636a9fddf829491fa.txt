if (wgNotice != '') document.writeln(wgNotice); List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
According to Falconer, one of the essential features of a fractal is that its Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension.[1] Presented here is a list of fractals ordered by increasing Hausdorff dimension, with the purpose of visualizing what it means for a fractal to have a low or a high dimension.
