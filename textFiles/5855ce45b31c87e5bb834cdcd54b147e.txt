A Scientologist is a follower of the doctrines and beliefs of Scientology.[1] Eileen Barker writes in New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response that the Church of Scientology considers any individual who has taken at least one Scientology course to be a Scientologist.[2] Scientology president Heber Jentzsch stated in a videotaped court deposition that membership statistics are based on the sum of all individuals that have ever taken any Scientology course since the organization's foundation in 1954.[3] The following is an incomplete list of notable past and present Scientologists.
