1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die is a musical reference book edited by Robert Dimery, released in 2006.
It consists of a list of albums released between 1950 and 2005, part of a series from Quintessence Editions Ltd. The book is arranged chronologically, starting with Frank Sinatra's In the Wee Small Hours and concluding with Guero by Beck. Each entry in the list is accompanied by a short essay written by a noted music critic. The entries are accompanied by pictures, quotes, and additional information (such as the album's running time and producer). Film soundtracks were excluded unless they consisted fully of original material.

[edit] Genres
Although the vast majority of the book's recommendations are rock and/or pop albums from the Western world, 1001 Albums also features a healthy sample of world music, R&B, rap, blues, hip hop, country, electronica, and jazz. The rock and pop albums included are also quite diverse, featuring such subgenres as punk, grindcore, heavy metal, alternative rock, progressive rock, easy listening, and 1950s-style rock and roll.
