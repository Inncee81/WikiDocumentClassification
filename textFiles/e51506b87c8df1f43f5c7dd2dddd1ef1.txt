Former U.S. President Bill Clinton at TED in 2007


TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is an annual conference that defines its mission as "ideas worth spreading". The lectures, also called TED Talks, cover a broad set of topics including science, arts and design, politics, education, culture, business, global issues, technology and development, and entertainment. Speakers have included such people as former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Nobel laureates James D. Watson, Murray Gell-Mann, and Al Gore, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and Billy Graham.[1]
The TED staff is headquartered in New York City and Vancouver. The conference has been held in Monterey, California, since its founding, but as of 2009 is being held in Long Beach, California due to an increased number of attendees.[2] The TED conference also has a companion conference, TED Global, held in varying locations.
Approximately 370 TED talks are provided for free viewing online. As of January 2009, talks had been viewed over 90 million times by more than 15 million people.[3][4]

Chris Anderson addresses TED in 2007


TED was founded by Richard Saul Wurman and Harry Marks in 1984, and has been held annually since 1990. Wurman left after the 2002 conference; the event is now hosted by Chris Anderson and owned by his non-profit organization The Sapling Foundation,[5] devoted to "leveraging the power of ideas to change the world". In 2006, attendance cost $4,400 and was by invitation only.[6] The membership model was shifted in January of 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools and conference DVDs.
Since June 2006, TED Talks have been made available in an increasing number of locations including:[7]
