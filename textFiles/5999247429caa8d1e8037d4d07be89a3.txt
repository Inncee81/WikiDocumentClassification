Howard Bloom in January 2008.


Howard Bloom (born 1943 in Buffalo, New York) is an American author. In 1976, he co-founded The Howard Bloom Organization Ltd, and was in charge of public relations for artists such as Michael Jackson, Prince, KISS, Billy Joel, John Couger Mellencamp, Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Middler, Joan Jett, AC/DC, Talking Heads and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. He was also a central figure of the Music In Action coalition that fought Tipper Gore and the Parental Music Resource Center (PMRC) during the music censorship scandals.[1] He founded the International Paleopsychology Project; a group of scientists from various disciplines (including physics, microbiology, paleontology, endocrinology, neurobiology, anthropology, history and human ethology) whose goal is to study the development of the universe from its conception to the present.[2]

[edit] Writings
Bloom has written two books, The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition Into the Forces of History and Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century.
