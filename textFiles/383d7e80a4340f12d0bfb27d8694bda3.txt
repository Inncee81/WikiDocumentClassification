Orb is a freeware streaming software that enables users to remotely access all their personal digital media files including pictures, music, videos, webcams and television.[1] It can be used from any Internet-enabled device, including laptops, pocket PC,[2] smartphones, PS3[3], Xbox 360[4] and Wii[5] video game consoles.
It is edited by Orb Networks of Emeryville, California.
Orb recently released the beta of its 2.0 version (called Orb MyCasting) which is AJAX based.[6]

[edit] What it does
Orb is available for Windows or Media Center PCs. There is a need to create an account. With that account, it is possible to log into the PC remotely.

[edit] Access to videos, audio, images
All the music, pictures and video files stored on a home computer are made available for streaming, provided that the computer is connected to the internet. The media files are transcoded and streamed directly from that PC, or available for download with the use of a file explorer plug-in.
The current version of Orb can be used as a replacement for Microsoft's Windows Media Connect software for computers running the Windows operating system. This allows the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 consoles to access the videos, audios, and images on the computer with Orb installed, natively. This allows the user to also watch videos not in the Windows Media Video format without having previously re-transcoded their videos. Orb will transcode the video files from the computer on the fly as they are requested as long as the computer running Orb has the correct codec for doing so.[7]

[edit] Access to a Tuner Card or Webcam and Webbased DVR
If there is a tuner card installed on that PC, live TV is also available for streaming. Furthermore, Orb offers a DVR functionality, like a Tivo. One can schedule TV recordings and stream the recorded video files remotely via the Web-based interface.[8])
Same is true for a webcam (there's also a webcam surveillance feature) .

[edit] Sharing
Orb also allows the user to share photos and videos without having to upload them to an online service. To do that, one has to select the files one wants to share, and enter the email address of the person that should have access to that data. That person will receive an email with a link to view the files.

[edit] Mobile Phone Usage

[edit] Supported Mobile Phones
Orb supports streaming to Windows Media, Real Player, 3gp and Flash format, supporting a wide range of 3G cell phones.

[edit] Adaptive Streaming inside a LAN or to a mobile phone
Orb will detect the type of device you're using, and adapt the stream according to your player availability and the network quality.[9]
For example on the Nokia N80, Orb will use the native web browser and Real Player[10]
When the device used to connect is on the same local network as the PC where Orb is running, it will connect directly to the stream from the PC without going through the Internet (provided no firewall blocks the connection). This provides a much higher bit rate and quality when streaming inside a LAN.

[edit] New features in Orb 2.0
Orb 2.0 beta is Ajax-based and offers a home page similar to Google Personalized Homepage or netvibes. It is organized into tabs, with each tab containing user-defined modules, such as TV guide, personal media files, RSS/Atom feeds such as YouTube videos, the local weather forecast, etc...[11]

[edit] Similar Products
A similar solution is Slingbox, which does not require a PC, but comes with its own hardware. Unlike Orb, Slingbox is not free.
Another similar solution for remote access is ifunpix, which additionally includes tools to create and upload content to a personal mini-site support video as well as audio and music. Unlike Orb, iFunPix uses a proxy storage server between the user and the home computer which can help prevent attacks on the source computer. iFunPix is not able to stream live television.
There is also TVersity, another software completely free, much like orb. CyberLink Live is available in both free and subscription versions.

[edit] References

Digizonis another product similar to Slingbox. It comes with its own hardware with built-in H.264 video streamer with quality up to 704*576 pixcels.
