Render of two Drinking Birds.


Drinking birds are toy heat engines that mimic the motions of a bird drinking from a fountain or other water source. They are also known as bobble, happy, dippy, dipping, tippy, tipping, sippy, sipping, sippy-dip, dip-dip, dinking, dinky-dinky, or dunking birds.[citation needed] It is sometimes incorrectly considered a perpetual motion device.

[edit] Construction and materials
A drinking bird consists of two glass bulbs, joined by a tube (the bird's neck). The tube extends nearly all the way into the bottom bulb but does not extend into the top. The space inside is typically filled with colored dichloromethane (also known as methylene chloride).
Air is removed from the apparatus, so the space inside the body is filled by dichloromethane vapor. The upper bulb has a "beak" attached which, along with the head, is covered in a felt-like material. The bird is typically decorated with paper eyes, a blue top hat (plastic), and a single green tail feather. The whole setup is pivoted on a variable point on the neck.
Despite its classification and appearance as a toy, there are safety considerations. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances. New versions alleviate this concern by employing dichloromethane, which is nonflammable. However, it can irritate the skin and lungs and is a mutagen and teratogen and is potentially a carcinogen. This does not render the bird unsafe, but owners should exercise caution not to break the toy, especially when displaying it near children and animals.

[edit] Physical and chemical principles
The drinking bird is an interesting exhibition of several physical laws and is therefore a staple of basic chemistry and physics education. These include:

The combined gas law, which establishes a proportional relationship between temperature and pressure exerted by a gas in a constant volume.
The ideal gas law, which establishes a proportional relationship between number of gas particles and pressure in a constant volume.
The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, which establishes that molecules in a given space at a given temperature vary in energy level, and therefore can exist in multiple phases (solid/liquid/gas) at a single temperature.
Heat of vaporization (or condensation), which establishes that substances absorb (or give off) heat when changing state at a constant temperature.
Torque and center of mass
Capillary action of the wicking felt.


[edit] How it works
The drinking bird is a heat engine that exploits a temperature differential to convert heat energy to a pressure differential within the device, and perform mechanical work. The process is pseudoperiodic but does not constitute a true thermodynamic cycle, because the working fluid is necessarily lost to evaporation. The initial state of the system is a bird with a wet head oriented vertically with an initial oscillation on its pivot.
The process operates as follows:

The water evaporates from the felt on the head (Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution).
Evaporation lowers the temperature of the glass head (heat of vaporization).
The temperature's drop causes some of the dichloromethane vapor in the head to condense.
The lower temperature and condensation together cause the pressure to drop in the head (ideal gas law).
The pressure differential between the head and base causes the liquid to be pushed up from the base.
As liquid flows into the head, the bird becomes top heavy and tips over during its oscillations.
When the bird tips over, the bottom end of the neck tube rises above the surface of the liquid.
A bubble of vapor rises up the tube through this gap, displacing liquid as it goes.
Liquid flows back to the bottom bulb, and vapor pressure equalizes between the top and bottom bulbs
The weight of the liquid in the bottom bulb restores the bird to its vertical position
The liquid in the bottom bulb is heated by ambient air, which is at a temperature slightly higher than the temperature of the bird's head.

If a glass of water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will continue to absorb water and the cycle will continue as long as there is enough water in the glass to keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head -- for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine. The ultimate source of energy is the temperature gradient between the toy and the surrounding environment -- the toy is not a perpetual motion machine.
A recent analysis [1] showed that the evaporative heat flux driving a small bird was about 0.5 W, whereas the mechanical power expressed in its motion was about 50 microwatts, or a total system efficiency of about 0.01%. More practically, about 1 microwatt can be extracted from the bird, either with a coil/magnet or a ratchet used to winch paperclips.

[edit] History
The drinking bird was invented by Miles V. Sullivan in 1945 and patented in 1946. He was a Ph.D. inventor-scientist at Bell labs in Murray Hill, NJ, USA. US Patent number 2402463.

[edit] The drinking bird in popular culture
The bird was an instant hit upon its creation and achieved near iconic status. It has even appeared in the American TV show The Simpsons, in the episodes "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" "King-Size Homer", and "Das Bus". In the first, the drinking bird is displayed by Homer's half-brother Herb Powell as an example of a great invention. However, when Herb begins to talk about his own invention, Homer is still mesmerized by the bird and even offers to buy it from him. In "King-Size Homer", Homer uses the drinking bird to operate the Y key (for "yes") on his work-at-home computer that controlled the necessary venting of gas for the nuclear power plant. Unfortunately, Homer neglects to check on the bird and it falls over, creating a critical situation in the area under Homer's control. In "Das Bus", it is visible on Homer's desktop, and is snapped later in the episode.
A drinking bird also appears in the 1951 Merrie Melodies cartoon Putty Tat Trouble. Tweety Bird spies one "drinking" from a glass and, mistaking it for a real bird, asks if he can join it. Tweety mistakes the toy's bobbing motion for a nod of assent and joins it, imitating its back-and-forth movement exactly. Shortly, Sam, another cat who is fighting with Sylvester over Tweety, swallows the drinking bird by mistake, and his body then uncontrollably mimics the same bobbing motion.
A drinking bird appears in the Family Guy episode "8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter", when Peter has a flashback about a "breakfast machine" that he purchased. The drinking bird was used to press a button which inflated a balloon, subsequently pulling a trigger on a pistol and shooting Peter in the shoulder.
Two drinking birds can be seen on the communal table aboard the space freighter Nostromo during the opening scenes of the 1979 science fiction film "Alien", directed by Ridley Scott.
In the 1990 film Darkman, drinking birds are used to set off explosions - one in Westlake's lab, and the other in a warehouse.
In the 2008 film "Max Payne" a drinking bird can be seen on inspector Jim Bravura's desk and represents a minor timeline inconsistency as during the conversation it does not observe it's normal cycle.
The drinking bird (under the name "water bird") is a furniture item in the Animal Crossing videogames. It also appears as the "dunkin' dragon" in the Sierra game Quest for Glory I, and it makes an appearance in the Gremlin Interactive game Normality.
The Pokémon Porygon2 looks simillar to a drinking bird.
