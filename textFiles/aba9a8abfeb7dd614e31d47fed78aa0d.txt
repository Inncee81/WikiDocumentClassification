Total dead
World War II casualty statistics vary greatly. Estimates of total dead range from 50 million to over 70 million.[36] The sources cited on this page document an estimated death toll in World War II of roughly 72 million, making it the deadliest ever. Civilians killed totaled around 47 million, including 20 million from war-related disease and famine. Total military dead: about 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 4 million prisoners of war. Axis dead: approximately 11 million; Allied dead: about 61 million.

Recent historical scholarship




During World War II the death toll in the Soviet Union was over 20 million: Nazi massacre in Kerch, 1942


Recent historical scholarship has shed new light on the topic. Research in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union has caused a revision of estimates of Soviet war dead. Estimated USSR losses within postwar borders now stand at 26.6 million.[37] Researchers in post-communist Poland now put Polish civilian deaths at German hands at between 4.9 and 5.1 million.[43][94][47]
The German Army historian Dr. Rüdiger Overmans published a study in 2000 that estimated German military dead and missing at 5.3 million.[6] War dead totals on this page for the British Commonwealth are based on research by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.[29]
Casualties here listed include about 12 million war-related famine deaths in China, Indonesia, French Indochina and India, often omitted from compilations of World War II casualties.[9][5]

Casualties by country
The casualties of World War II were suffered disproportionately by the various participants. This is especially true regarding civilian casualties. The following chart gives data on the casualties suffered by each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. Military casualties include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Nazi persecution, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, Allied war crimes and deaths due to war related famine and disease. Jewish losses in the Holocaust are listed separately for each nation, since they are known. Compiling or estimating the numbers of deaths caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed during World War II.[36] The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the U.S.S.R, China, Poland, Germany and Yugoslavia, our sources can give us only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war related famine. The footnotes give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources.

Chart showing World War II deaths by country in millions as well as by percentage of population, and piechart with percentage of military and civilian deaths for the Allied and the Axis Powers.



Figures rounded to the nearest hundredth place.
Population in 1939 - Source: Population Statistics[59]
War losses are for the national boundaries of 1939.
Total Soviet losses in the postwar 1946-91 boundaries [60] were 26.6 million.[37]
Total Polish losses in the postwar 1946 boundaries[61] were 2,723,000.[40,183]

Partisan (military) and Resistance fighter deaths forces are included with military losses. The deaths of prisoners of war in captivity and personnel missing in action are also included with military deaths. The armed forces of the various nations are treated as single entities, for example the deaths of Austrians, Soviets, French and ethnic Germans in the Wehrmacht are included with German military losses.
Prisoner of war deaths in Nazi captivity totaled 3.1 Million[17,Table A]600,000 in Soviet captivity [7,278] [3,].
POW deaths in Japanese captivity totaled 467,000. Detailed by country: China 400,000 .[5,Table 5A] ; Netherlands-Military 8,500 [5,Table 5A]; U.K. 12,430 [5,Table 5A]; U.K. Colonies 11,060 [5,Table 5A] ; Canada 270 [5,Table 5A]; Philippines 27,260.[5,Table 5A]; Australia 7,410[5,Table 5A]; and the United States 12,643 [89]
Civilian Deaths - Includes losses from military action and war related deaths caused by famine and disease.
The Holocaust took the lives of between 5.1 to 6.0 million Jews.[61] Other groups persecuted and killed by the Nazis [80][60] [49] [48] [17]. included 130,000 to 500,000 Gypsies [48] [50] [62]; 150,000 to 200,000 handicapped persons [51] ; 2.6 to 3 million Soviet prisoners of war[52]; 1.8 to 1.9 million Poles [38]; 4.5 to 8.2 million Soviet civilians [53][60] [48]; about 10,000 Gay men[54]; about 1,000 Jehovah's Witnesses [55]; between 1,000 to 2,000 Roman Catholic clergy [57] and an unknown number of Freemasons [56]. "The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder." [58] From 1933-1939 the number of German deaths in Nazi concentration camps were 165,415[59], primarily Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats, and trade union leaders. [90]
The civilian victims of Japanese war crimes totaled 5,469,000. Detailed by country: China 3,695,000; Indochina 457,000; Korea 378,000; Indonesia 375,000; Malaya 346,000 ; Philippines 119,000, Burma 60,000 and Pacific Islands 57,000. [4, Chap.3]..[5,Table 5A]
The deaths of 400,000 civilians deported during the Soviet annexations in 1939-40 are included with World War II casualties.[47][3,]Civilian losses in the postwar era (1946-47) due to famine and disease are not included with these losses.
Jewish Holocaust Deaths. 5.7 million (78%) of the 7.3 million Jews in German dominated Europe perished in the war.-[14,242-244]
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Annual Report 2007-08[29,10] is the source of the military dead for the British Empire The war dead totals listed in the report are based on the research by the CWGC to identify and commemorate Commonwealth war dead. The statistics tabulated The Commonwealth War Graves Commission are representative of the number of names commemorated for all servicemen/women of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth and former U.K. Dependencies, whose death was attributable to their war service. Some auxiliary and civilian organisations are also accorded war grave status if death occurred under certain specified conditions. For the purposes of C.W.G.C. the dates of inclusion for Commonwealth War Dead are 03/09/1939 to 31/12/1947. The report is available online at [63]

^ China
The official Chinese Communist statistics of China's civilian and military casualties in the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937-1945 are 20 million dead and 15 million wounded. The figures for total military casualties, killed and wounded are: Nationalist 3.2 million; Communist 580,000 and collaborator forces 1.18 million; captured: collaborator forces 950,000.[34,4-9]
A study based on Chinese Nationalist sources estimates total war deaths of 15-20 million from all causes: military casualties: 1.5 million killed in battle, 750,000 missing in action, 1.5 million deaths due to disease and 3 million wounded; civilian casualties: due to military activity, killed 1,073,496 and 237,319 wounded; 335,934 killed and 426,249 wounded in Japanese air attacks [81]
John W. Dower has noted “ So great was the devastation and suffering in China that in the end it is necessary to speak of uncertain “millions” of deaths. Certainly, it is reasonable to think in general terms of approximately 10 million Chinese war dead, a total surpassed only by the Soviet Union” [9,295-296].R. J. Rummel's estimate of total war dead from 1937-45 is 19,605,000. The details are as follows:
Military dead: 3,400,000(including 400,000 POW ) Nationalist/Communist and 432,000 collaborator forces [5,Table 5A].
Civilian war deaths: 3,808,000 killed in fighting and 3,549,000 victims of Japanese war crimes (not including an additional 400,000 POWs);

During the Occupation of Denmark military war dead included 1,281Merchant Marine, 797 resistance fighters and 49 Army personnel. Civilian deaths included 628 victims of Nazi reprisals and 440 killed during military operations. The 3,900 Danish deaths in German military service are included with German losses. Figures are from Danish Military Historie website[71]
It has been argued that the disproportionately low figure for Danish dead is due mainly to the non violent policy of the Danish resistance movement during the occupation (see video: "A Force More Powerful", OCLC 45399754).
Deaths of Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 77.[14,244]

The official Ethiopian government report lists 760,000 deaths due to the war and Italian occupation from 1935-41. [75]. However, R. J. Rummel estimates 200,000 Ethiopians and Libyans killed by the Italians from the 1920's-41, his estimate is " based on Discovery TV Cable Channel Program "Timewatch" 1/17/92.[4,Chap.14]

Civilian war dead were 2,000 .[2,58-59], due in part to theBombing of Helsinki in World War II
^ France
Military war dead include 150,000 regular forces(1939-40 Battle of France 92,000; 1940-45 on Western Front (World War II) 58,000); 20,000 French resistance fighters and 40,000 POWs in Germany.[2,60-65] There were an additional 5,000 military deaths in French Indochina.[16,414-15] The pro-German Vichy France forces lost 2,653 killed.[16,582] Vadim Erlikman, a Russian historian, estimates losses of Africans in the French Colonial Forces at about 22,000.[3,83-99] French deaths in German Army (30-40,000), mostly men conscripted in Alsace-Lorraine, are not included in these totals.

^ Germany
The 1939 Population is for Germany within 1937 borders and the Free City of Danzig. Not included in the German population are Austria and the 6,912,000 [23,] ethnic Germans of eastern Europe[74]. However, the 534,000 military deaths of ethnic Germans in eastern Europe and 261,000 from Austria are included with total German losses[6].
^ Dr. Rűdiger Overmans of the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office has provided a reassessment of German military war dead based on a statistical analysis of German military personnel records.[6]. Overmans concluded that these losses were 5,318,0000.[6]. , not including the deaths of 215,000 Soviet citizens conscripted by Germany [7,278]. German losses were previously estimated at 4.5 million[31,111-129], Overmans includes 344,000 deaths that were previously listed as civilian losses in eastern Europe and 230,000 as paramilitary, Volkssturm and police forces fighting with the regular forces. Overmans lists the following losses- Africa 16,066 ; the Balkans 103,693 ; Northern Europe 30,165 ; Western Europe until 12/31/44- 339,957 ; Italy 150,660; against the U.S.S.R. until 12/31/44- 2,742,909 ; final battles in Germany during 1945-1,230,045 ; other (including air war in Germany & at sea) 245,561 ; confirmed deaths of POWs in captivity 459,475 (including 363,000 in Soviet captivity)- Grand Total 5.318 million. Overmans lists losses of 4,456,000 from pre-war Germany, 261,000 from Austria, 534,000 ethnic Germans from eastern Europe, 30,000 French and 37,000 volunteers from western Europe. Included in the total of 5.3 Million war dead are 2.0 million men listed as missing in action or unaccounted for after the war.[6,333-336]Dr. Rüdiger Overmans believes that “It seems entirely plausible, while not provable,that one half of the missing were killed in action, the other half however in fact died in Soviet custody” [6,289] Soviet sources list the deaths of 474,967 of the 2,652,672 German Armed Forces POW taken in the War. [12,109]
For a critical analysis of the statistical methodology of Overmans see[75] In addition to these losses the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht reported the losses of Soviet citizens serving in the German military [24]separately, these losses were not included in the Overmans analysis of German casualties.[6,228-230]. A Russian source, G. I. Krivosheev reported these losses as 215,000[7,278]. In this schedule they are included with German military war dead.
^  German civilian casualties totaled about 1.7 million including: 360-370,000 killed by Strategic bombing[25,460]., 762,000 victims of Nazi persecution and genocide.[17,Table A], 100,000.[3,43] civilians killed in the Battle of Berlin[76], 270,000 victims of Soviet war crimes and 205,000 during the Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union[82,19]. Civilians killed by Strategic bombing were within the 1937 German boundaries[25,460]. The victims of Nazi persecution and genocide from 1933 to 1945 included political prisoners, victims of the Action T4 euthanasia program, Gay men and 160,000 German Jews .[17,Table A]
German civilian deaths due to the expulsion of Germans after World War II are not included with World War Two Casualties. A 1958 West German government study estimated 2.3 million civilians perished during the post war expulsions.[83,26] However, Rűdiger Overmans points out that there are only about 500,000 confirmed deaths of German civilians in eastern Europe, the balance being a demographic estimate, Overmans believes that new research on the number of expulsion deaths is needed.[6,298-299][77]. A more recent study published by the German government in 1989 estimated the death toll at about 635,000. (270,000) as the result of Soviet war crimes,(160,000) during the expulsion of Germans after World War II and (205,000) in the Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union [82,19]
Additional post war famine deaths in occupied Germany of 250,000 [3,43] are also not included with World War Two Casualties
The genocide of Roma people was 15,000 persons.[13,183] Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 160,000.[14,244]
^ A preliminary estimate of war dead in 1949 by the West German government for the population in the borders of 1937 Germany only, was 3,250,000 military dead and missing plus 500,000 dead and 1,533,000 missing civilians[30,1949-8/226]. In 1956 these figures were revised; 3,760,000 military dead and missing, 410,000 civilians killed by Strategic bombing and 1,260,000 civilians killed in the expulsions from Poland.[30,1956-10/494]. These figures were for Germany in 1937 borders only and did not include additional losses from Austria (280,000 military and 24,000 civilians); ethnic Germans from eastern Europe (432,000 military and 886,000 civilians killed in expulsions); and 60,000 military deaths of men from France and western Europe.

Hungarian military losses include 110,000 men who were conscripted from the annexed territories of Greater Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia and the deaths of 20-25,000 Jews conscripted for Army labor units. Soviet sources list the deaths of 54,700 of the 513,700 Hungarian POW taken in the War. [7,278] Civilian losses of about 80,000 include 45,500 killed in the 1944-45 military campaign and in air attacks,[8,58-60] and the genocide of Roma people of 28,000 persons.[13,188]Jewish Holocaust victims, in 1939 borders, totaled 200,000.[14,244].

Gurkhas recruited from Nepal fought with the British Indian Army during the Second World War.
Civilian losses were caused by the Bengal famine of 1943. [4, Chap 3][9,297]. Amartya Sen currently the Lamont University Professor at Harvard University has recently estimated that two to two and a half million fatalities may be more accurate. [98]
^ Indonesia-Dutch East Indies
John W. Dower cites a UN report that estimated 4 million famine and forced labor dead during the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia. [9,296].
The United Nations reported in 1947 that “about 30,000 Europeans and 300,000 Indonesian internees and forced laborers died during the occupation.” They reported, “The total number who were killed by the Japanese, or who died from, hunger, disease and lack of medical attention is estimated at 3,000,000 for Java alone, 1,000,000 for the Outer Islands. Altogether 35,000 of the 240,000 Europeans died; most of them were men of working age.” [91,13-14]

An additional 300,000 Japanese prisoners died in Soviet hands after the surrender in Manchuria, Korea and the U.S.S.R.[9,297-299]. The Japanese Ministry of Welfare and Foreign Office reported that 347,000 military personnel and civilians were dead or missing in Soviet hands after the war. The Japanese list the losses of 199,000 in Manchurian transit camps, 36,000 in North Korea, 9,000 from Sakhalin and 103,000 in the U.S.S.R.. [44,116-118] These figures were disputed by the Soviet Union, which reported the deaths of only about 60,000 of the 609,400 Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union [3,81]
Military deaths include Koreans (14,527) [84,57] and Chinese from Taiwan(30,304)[82] conscripted by Japan. Not included in Japanese war dead are 432,000 Chinese military forces collaborating with Japan. [5,Table 5A]
John W. Dower reports civilian losses due to U. S. Strategic bombing according to official Japanese figures were 393,367 dead, including 210,000 killed in the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 97,031 in the Bombing of Tokyo in World War II. In addition to these deaths 150,000 civilians were killed on Okinawa and 10,000 on Saipan during the fighting.[9,297-299] War related deaths of Japanese merchant marine personnel were 27,000.[16,578]
The Yasukuni Shrine in Japan lists a total of 2,325,128 military deaths from 1937-1945 including civilians who participated in combat, Chinese(Taiwan) and Koreans in the Japanese Armed Forces.
^ Korea
The American researcher R. J. Rummel's estimates 378,000 Korean dead due to forced labor in Japan and Manchuria. According to Rummel “Information on Korean deaths under Japanese occupation is difficult to uncover. We do know that 5,400,000 Koreans were conscripted for labor beginning in 1939, but how many died can only be roughly estimated.”.[4,Chap 3].
John W. Dower has reported “ Between 1939 and 1945, close to 670,000 Koreans were brought to Japan for fixed terms of work, mostly in mines and heavy industry, and it has been estimated that 60,000 or more of them died under harsh conditions of their work places. Over 10,000 others were probably killed in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki” [9,47].
A Korean demographic study reports “the mortality level and the course of mortality changes among Koreans in Korea during the war, appear not to have been much affected. Even for all Koreans living in Korea, Japan and Manchuria, the impact of World War II on the trend and level of mortality is not likely to have been significant. The same source reports '6,369 Koreans to have died in the Japanese military forces, and the number rises to 14,527 when civilians attached to the military forces is added’[84,57]
Korean military forces fighting against Japan were the Korean Liberation Army under Chinese Nationalist command and the Korean Volunteer Army which fought with the Chinese Communist guerrillas.

Losses by ethnic group were 3,100,000 Jews; 2,000,000 ethnic Poles; 500,000 Ukrainians,Belarusians and ethnic Germans [47]
Civilian losses by geographic area [92] were 2.9 million in present day Poland [40] and about 2.5 million in the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union [41]
The official Polish government report prepared in 1947 claimed 6,028,000 war victims in German hands (including 123,178 military deaths, 2.8 million Poles and 3.2 million Jews), out of a population of 27,007,000 ethnic Poles and Jews; this report excluded ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian losses. Losses were calculated for the territory of Poland in 1939, including the territories annexed by the U.S.S.R.[39] The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has reported that in addition to 3 million Polish Jews killed in the Holocaust. "Documentation remains fragmentary, but today scholars of independent Poland believe that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians (non-Jews) were victims of German Occupation policies and the war",[43][38]; not including deaths caused by the Soviets. This revision of estimated war losses was the topic of articles in the Polish academic journals Dzieje Najnowsze .[42] and The Polish Quarterly of International Affairs[94]
Previously it was believed that about 1.0 million Polish citizens died at the hands of the Soviets [76]; however recently Polish historians, based on research in the Soviet archives, estimate the number of deaths at 120,000 to 350,000 people deported in 1939-1941. [41] [47] [72]
Poland lost a total of 239,800 regular soldiers and Polish resistance movement fighters during the war. [94,115].

Total casualties of these forces in exile were 33,256 killed in action, 8,548 missing in action, 42,666 wounded and 29,385 interned. [95] The Polish Red Cross reported that the 1944 Warsaw Uprising cost the lives of 120,000 -130,000 Polish civilians and 16-17,000 Polish resistance movement fighters [94,115].

^ Yugoslavia
The U.S. Bureau of the Census published a report in 1954 that concluded that Yugoslav war related deaths were 1,067,000. The U.S. Bureau of the Census noted that the official Yugoslav government figure of 1.7 million war dead was overstated because it "was released soon after the war and was estimated without the benefit of a postwar census" [67,23] A recent study by Vladimir Žerjavić estimates total war related deaths at 1,027,000. Military losses of 237,000 Yugoslav partisans and 209,000 Ustaše. Civilian dead of 581,000, including 57,000 Jews. Losses of the Yugoslav Republics were Bosnia 316,000; Serbia 273,000; Croatia 271,000; Slovenia 33,000; Montenegro 27,000; Macedonia 17,000; and killed abroad 80,000. [66]. Bogoljub Kočović a statistician, who is a Bosnian Serb by ethnic affiliation, calculated that the actual war losses were 1,014,000[85,172-80] The late Jozo Tomasevich , Professor Emeritus of Economics at San Francisco State University, believes that the calculations of Kočović and Žerjavić “ seem to be free of bias, we can accept them as reliable” [86,737]
The reasons for the high human toll in Yugoslavia were as follows:
A.Military operations between the Germans, Italians and their Ustaše collaborators on one hand against the Yugoslav partisans and Chetniks[86,744-50]
B.German forces, under express orders from Hitler, fought with a special vengeance against the Serbs, who were considered Untermensch [86,744-50] One of the worst massacres during the German military occupation of Serbia was the Kragujevac massacre.
C. Deliberate acts of reprisal against target populations were perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced the shooting of hostages on a large scale. At the end of the war Ustaše collaborators were killed during the Bleiburg massacre[86,744-50]
D.The systematic extermination of large numbers of people for political, religious or racial reasons. The most numerous victims were Serbs [86,744-50] The USHMM reports between 56,000 and 97,000 persons were killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp[64] [63]. However, Yad Vashem reports 600,000 deaths at Jasenovac. [65]. The genocide of Roma was 40,000 persons.[13,183-184]Jewish Holocaust victims totaled 67,122.[14,244]:
E.The reduced food supply caused famine and disease. [86,744-50]:
F.Allied bombing of German supply lines caused civilian casualties. The hardest hit localities were Podgorica, Leskovac, Zadar and Belgrade. [86,744-50]:
G. The demographic losses due to a 335,000 reduction in the number of births and emigration of about 660,000 are not included with war casualties. [86,744-50]
