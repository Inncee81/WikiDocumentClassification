[edit] Life

[edit] Youth and education
Tyson attended the Bronx High School of Science (1973–1976) where he captained the wrestling team and was editor-in-chief of the school's Physical Science Journal. Born the week that NASA was founded, Tyson had an abiding interest in astronomy from a young age — and obsessively studied it in his teens — eventually even gaining some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of 15. Tyson has stated that his interest in astronomy began when he would climb to the top floor of his New York City apartment building (named the "Skyview Apartments") and look at the moon through binoculars.
Astronomer Carl Sagan, who was a faculty member at Cornell University, tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for undergraduate studies,[1] but Tyson chose to attend Harvard, where he majored in physics. He was a member of the crew team in his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, eventually lettering in his senior year. Tyson earned his B.A. in physics from Harvard in 1980 and began his graduate work at the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned his M.A. in Astronomy in 1983. In addition to wrestling and rowing in college, he was also active in dancing in styles including jazz, ballet, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin Ballroom. In 1985, he won a gold medal with the University of Texas dance team at a national tournament in the International Latin Ballroom style. He began a doctoral program at the University of Texas, but transferred in 1988 to Columbia, earning a Ph.D. degree in astrophysics from that institution in 1991.

[edit] Professional career
Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for Natural History magazine. In a column for the magazine he authored in 2002, Tyson coined the term "Manhattanhenge" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the cross streets of the street grid in Manhattan, making sunset visible along unobstructed side streets.
In 2004, he hosted the four-part "Origins" miniseries of PBS's Nova,[2] and co-authored, with Donald Goldsmith (renowned California astronomer and science writer/professor) the companion volume for this series, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution.[3]
In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Tyson to serve on the Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry and in 2004 to serve on the President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy, the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars and Beyond" commission. He was soon afterward awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.
As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking to keep Pluto from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on The Colbert Report, The Daily Show and BBC Horizon that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.[4] In 2006, the I.A.U. confirmed this assessment by downgrading Pluto to "dwarf planet" classification.
Tyson is President of the Planetary Society, where he was formerly the Chair of the Board. He is the new host of the PBS program NOVA scienceNOW.[5]
Tyson is a vocal critic of string theory; his opposition comes from the seeming over-reliance of string theory upon mathematical projections instead of testable variables.[6]
He attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief symposium on November 2006. In 2007, Tyson, who is known for his colorful character, cheerful demeanor, and obvious awe of the vastness of the universe itself, was chosen to be a regular on The History Channel's new series The Universe, which has proven to be a popular series.
In terms of actual astrophysics, his research contributions have been minimal. He has not published a first author paper since his Ph.D. Thesis in 1991. He is, however, valued among the astronomy community for his popularization of science.

[edit] Honors

In addition to his earned degrees, Tyson is the recipient of honorary doctorates from City University of New York, Dominican College, Ramapo College, University of Richmond, Bloomfield College, Northeastern University, Pace University, Williams College, and University of Pennsylvania, as well as a Medal of Excellence from Columbia University.
Tyson was voted the "Sexiest Astrophysicist Alive" by People Magazine in 2000.
An asteroid, 13123 Tyson, is named in his honor.
Tyson is a wine enthusiast whose collection was featured in the May 31, 2000 issue of the Wine Spectator as well as the Spring 2005 issue The World of Fine Wine.
In 2004 Dr. Tyson was selected as one of the 50 Most Important African-Americans in Research Science.
Tyson was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People of 2007.[7]
Tyson was named the Klopsteg Memorial Award winner in 2007.
Tyson received the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest honor awarded by NASA to a non-government civilian, in 2004.

[edit] Non-scientific writings

Tyson lived next to the World Trade Center and was an eyewitness to the September 11, 2001 attacks. He wrote a widely circulated letter on what he saw.[8]
Tyson is non-religious and has argued that the intelligent design movement, of the kind that credits complex, yet-to-be-understood phenomena in nature to a higher intelligence, thwarts the advance of scientific knowledge.[9][10][11] Tyson's views on religion and spirituality might best be understood from his two essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"[12] and "Holy Wars"[11] both appearing in Natural History Magazine. From the 2006 Beyond Belief[13] workshop on Science and Religion, see excerpts from Tyson's talk on unintelligent design in the universe[14] and the spirituality of science itself.[15]
On June 6, 2008, after the conclusion of the Democratic presidential primaries, Tyson wrote an Op-Ed in The New York Times in which he presented a statistical analysis of recent polling data. From this analysis, Tyson concluded that in a hypothetical election held on the day of publication of his article, Barack Obama would lose to John McCain, whereas Hillary Clinton would beat McCain.[16]


[edit] Notable media appearances

He has appeared a record five times on The Colbert Report (October 26, 2005; August 16, 2006; April 30, 2007; February 13, 2008; June 25, 2008). He has also appeared three times on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (January 30, 2007; July 23, 2007; January 28, 2009), once to discuss black holes and his new book (Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries). Two days after his original January appearance on The Daily Show, the book ranked as the fourth best selling book on Amazon. He has also made appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien (March 15, 2007; July 25, 2007).
Tyson participated on the NPR radio quiz program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! on 24 February 2007 playing the "Not My Job" game.[17]
Tyson appeared as the Keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony of Deerfield Academy's new science center, the Koch Center on May 4, 2007. He emphasized the impact science will have on the 21st century, as well as explaining that investments into science may be costly, but their returns in the form of knowledge gained, and perking interest is invaluable.
He served as one of the central interviewees on the various episodes of the History Channel science program, The Universe.
Was referenced by Samantha Carter in the Stargate Atlantis episode "Trio" during a game of "Who Would You Rather...?". Upon hearing his name Dr. Rodney McKay claims Tyson stole an idea of his. Tyson later appears alongside Bill Nye in an episode of the series entitled "Brain Storm" in which he addresses McKay's claim of stealing ideas. [18]
Appeared as the Keynote speaker at The Amazing Meeting 6 — a science and skepticism conference hosted by the James Randi Educational Foundation — in June 2008.
Featured as a guest interviewee on episode #156 of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe on the July 16, 2008.
On October 25, 2008 he appeared on the series premiere of D.L. Hughley Breaks the News, a CNN comedic news show.
On January 19, 2009 he appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He talked about his new book The Pluto Files.
He appeared on "Who Wants To Be A Millionare" as the ask the expert lifeline
