Collaborative software (also referred to as groupware or workgroup support systems) is software designed to help people involved in a common task achieve their goals. Collaborative software is the basis for computer supported cooperative work.
Such software systems as email, calendaring, text chat and wiki belong to this category. It has been suggested that Metcalfe's law — the more people who use something, the more valuable it becomes — applies to such software.
The more general term social software applies to systems used outside the workplace, for example, online dating services and social networks like Friendster, Orkut and Facebook. The study of computer-supported collaboration includes the study of this software and social phenomena associated with it.

[edit] Overview
The design intent is to transform the way documents and rich media are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration. Examples include Google Docs, Microsoft SharePoint, Documentum, Collaber, Vignette Collab and Alfresco.
Collaboration, with respect to information technology, seems to have several definitions. Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application. Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs.
There are three primary ways in which humans interact: conversations, transactions, and collaborations[citation needed].
Conversational interaction is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building. There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints. Communication technology such as telephones, instant messaging, and e-mail are generally sufficient for conversational interactions.
Transactional interaction involves the exchange of transaction entities where a major function of the transaction entity is to alter the relationship between participants. The transaction entity is in a relatively stable form and constrains or defines the new relationship. One participant exchanges money for goods and becomes a customer. Transactional interactions are most effectively handled by transactional systems that manage state and commit records for persistent storage.
In collaborative interactions the main function of the participants' relationship is to alter a collaboration entity (i.e., the converse of transactional). The collaboration entity is in a relatively unstable form. Examples include the development of an idea, the creation of a design, the achievement of a shared goal. Therefore, real collaboration technologies deliver the functionality for many participants to augment a common deliverable. Record or document management, threaded discussions, audit history, and other mechanisms designed to capture the efforts of many into a managed content environment are typical of collaboration technologies.
Collaboration in Education- two or more co-equal individuals voluntarily bring their knowledge and experiences together by interacting toward a common goal in the best interest of students' needs for the betterment of their educational success.
An emerging category of computer software, a collaboration platform is a unified electronic platform that supports synchronous and asynchronous communication through a variety of devices and channels.
An extension of groupware is collaborative media, software that allows several concurrent users to create and manage information in a website. Collaborative media models include wiki (Comparison of wiki software) and Slashdot models. Some sites with publicly accessible content based on collaborative software are: WikiWikiWeb, Wikipedia and Everything2. By method used we can divide them into:

Web-based collaborative tools
Software collaborative tools

By area served we can divide them into:

Knowledge management tools
Knowledge creation tools
Information sharing tools
Collaborative project management tools


[edit] Collaborative project management tools
Collaborative Project Management Tools (CPMT) definition is very similar to Collaborative Management Tool(CMT) definition except that CMT may only facilitate and manage a certain group activities for a part of a bigger project or task, while CPMT covers all detailed aspects of collaboration activities and management of the overall project and its related knowledge areas.
Another major difference is that CMP may include social software while CPMT mostly considers business or corporate related goals with some kind of social boundaries most commonly used for project management.

[edit] Background
During the mid – 1990s Project Management started to evolve into Collaborative Project Management; this was when the process in which a project’s inputs and outputs were carried out started to change with the evolution of the internet. Since the geographical boundaries broadened the development teams increasingly became more remote changing the dynamics of a project team thus changing the way a project was managed.
Former chairman of GE Jack Welch believed that you could not be successful if you went it alone in a global economy. Therefore Welch became a driving force behind not only collaboration between organizations, but also collaborative project management.

In addition to most CMT examples, CPMT also includes:

HR and equipment management
Time and cost management
Online chat
Instant messaging
Telephony
Videoconferencing
Data conferencing
Application sharing
Electronic meeting systems (EMS)
Synchronous conferencing
E-mail
Faxing
voice mail
Wikis
Web publishing
Revision control
Charting
Document versioning
Document retention
Document sharing
Document repository
Evaluation and survey



CMT facilitate and manage social or group activities.
Examples Include:

Electronic calendars
Project management systems
Workflow systems
Knowledge management
Prediction markets
Extranet systems
Social software
Online spreadsheets

[edit] Dimensions
Different frameworks could be established based on a project needs and requirements in order to find the best software. But the best framework is the one in which the characteristics are so well defined that they cover all the aspects of collaboration activities and management of the overall project.

[edit] Example of some common Dimension for CPM Tool
The challenge in determining which CPM software to use is having a good understanding of the requirements and tools needed for project development. There are many dynamics that make project management challenging (coordination, collaboration, sharing of knowledge and effectiveness of pm’s to facilitate the process). Choosing the right CPM software is essential to complementing these issues. According to a survey conducted in 2008 to find out what project managers expectations and uses of project management software are, the features most important to project managers with project management software were:

Ability to plan using and sequence activities using CPM/PDM/PERT or Gantt Chart method,
Produce project master schedules based on project/task breakdown structures, with subordinate details,
Critical path calculation.

[edit] The Three levels of collaboration
Groupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of collaboration—communication tools, conferencing tools and collaborative management (Co-ordination) tools.
Communication can be thought of as unstructured interchange of information. A phone call or an IM Chat discussion are examples of this. Conferencing (or collaboration level, as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels) refers to interactive work toward a shared goal. Brainstorming or voting are examples of this. Co-ordination refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal. A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team; everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win. That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal: co-ordination.

[edit] Electronic communication tools
Electronic communication tools send messages, files, data, or documents between people and hence facilitate the sharing of information. Examples include:

synchronous conferencing
e-mail
faxing
voice mail
Wikis
Web publishing
revision control


[edit] Electronic conferencing tools
Electronic conferencing tools facilitate the sharing of information, but in a more interactive way. Examples include:

Internet forums (also known as message boards or discussion boards) — a virtual discussion platform to facilitate and manage online text messages
Online chat — a virtual discussion platform to facilitate and manage real-time text messages
Instant Messaging
Telephony — telephones allow users to interact
Videoconferencing — networked PCs share video and audio signals
Data conferencing — networked PCs share a common whiteboard that each user can modify
Application sharing — users can access a shared document or application from their respective computers simultaneously in real time
Electronic meeting systems (EMS) — originally these were described as "electronic meeting systems," and they were built into meeting rooms. These special purpose rooms usually contained video projectors interlinked with numerous PCs; however, electronic meeting systems have evolved into web-based, any time, any place systems that will accommodate "distributed" meeting participants who may be dispersed in several locations.


[edit] Collaborative management tools
Collaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities. Examples include:

electronic calendars (also called time management software) — schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members
project management systems — schedule, track, and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed
workflow systems — collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process
knowledge management systems — collect, organize, manage, and share various forms of information
prediction markets — let a group of people predict together the outcome of future events
extranet systems (sometimes also known as 'project extranets') — collect, organize, manage and share information associated with the delivery of a project (eg: the construction of a building)
social software systems — organize social relations of groups
online spreadsheets — collaborate and share structured data and information


[edit] Implementation
One of the biggest hurdles in implementing groupware is convincing people to use it. Training is required to make people comfortable using it, and if people don't feel comfortable with the software, they won't use it. Employees should be given incentives to contribute: the rewards could be either financial or psychological.
In many cases collaboration is at odds with the company's corporate culture so implementation will be disruptive. Shifting a corporate culture from being competitive to being cooperative is no small undertaking. It will require changes at all levels of the organization, including the CEO.
One of the biggest hurdles is the typical large enterprise desire to standardise knowledge practice across that enterprise and to implement tools and processes which support that aim. Much greater value and quicker implementation can be achieved by avoidance of the "one size fits all" meme. Driving people to adopt the same active role (for example: contribution measured by number of uploads) only produces the behaviour driven by the metric - "the game exists of the rules by which it is played". Cultivate the practice of collaboration where it flourishes of its own volition to gain the quickest return.

[edit] Voting methods
Voting has many uses in collaboration software. Condorcet voting offers input from multiple experts or perspectives and may reduce intransitivity problems in decision making. In recommendation systems, rating or voting on many items can be used to formulate profiles for highly successful recommendations; and in document collaboration, such as Wikipedia, voting methods help to guide the creation of new pages.
Use of voting to order lists of sections such as this one remains largely unexplored. This also pertains to collective intelligence.
