Activity diagram for a for loop


Activity diagrams are a loosely defined diagram technique for showing workflows of stepwise activities and actions, with support for choice, iteration and concurrency.[1] In the Unified Modeling Language, activity diagrams can be used to describe the business and operational step-by-step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.

[edit] Overview
In SysML the activity diagram has been extended to indicate flows among steps that convey physical element (e.g., gasoline) or energy (e.g., torque, pressure). Additional changes allow the diagram to better support continuous behaviors and continuous data flows.
In UML 1.x, an activity diagram is a variation of the UML State diagram in which the "states" represent activities, and the transitions represent the completion of those activities.

[edit] Construction
Activity diagrams are typically used for business process modeling. They consist of:

Initial node.
Activity final node.
Activities

The starting point of the diagram is the initial node, and the activity final node is the ending. An activity diagram can have zero or more activity final nodes. In between activities are represented by rounded rectangles.
