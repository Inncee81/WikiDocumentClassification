Struwwelpeter in a children's book from 1917.


Der Struwwelpeter (1845) is a popular German children's book by Heinrich Hoffmann. It comprises ten illustrated and rhymed stories, mostly about children. Each has a clear moral that demonstrates the disastrous consequences of misbehavior in an exaggerated way. The title of the first story provides the title of the whole book. Literally translated, Struwwel-Peter means Shaggy-Peter.

[edit] History
Hoffmann, a Frankfurt physician, wanted to buy a picture book for his son for Christmas in 1844. Not impressed by what the stores had to offer, he instead bought a notebook and wrote his own stories and pictures.[1] Hoffmann was persuaded by friends to publish the book anonymously as Lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder mit 15 schön kolorierten Tafeln für Kinder von 3-6 Jahren (Funny Stories and Jocose Pictures with 15 Beautifully Coloured Panels for Children Aged 3 to 6) in 1845. It was not until the third edition in 1858 that the book was published under the title Struwwelpeter. The book became very popular among children throughout Europe, and, writes author and researcher Penni Cottton, the pictures and characters showed a great deal of originality and directness.[1]
Struwwelpeter has been translated into several languages. The first English translation appeared in 1848. Mark Twain's English translation of the book is called "Slovenly Peter."
In 2006, Fantagraphics Books published the first completely digital version of Struwwelpeter, reinterpreted and illustrated by Bob Staake.

[edit] Stories




Nikolas, as he is about to dunk three boys in his inkstand. Illustration from a 1917 edition.



"Struwwelpeter" (Shock-headed Peter) describes a boy who does not groom himself properly and is consequently unpopular.
In "Die Geschichte vom bösen Friederich" (The Story of Cruel Frederick), a violent boy terrorizes animals and people. Eventually he is bitten by a dog, who goes on to eat the boy's sausages while he is bedridden.
In "Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug" (The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches), a girl plays with matches and burns to death.
In "Die Geschichte von den schwarzen Buben" (The Story of the Inky Boys), Nikolas (that is, Saint Nicholas[2]) catches three boys teasing a dark-skinned boy. To teach them a lesson, he dips the three boys in black ink, to make them even darker-skinned than the boy they'd teased.
"Die Geschichte von dem wilden Jäger" (The Story of the Wild Huntsman) is the only story not primarily focused on children. In it, a hare steals a hunter's rifle and eyeglasses and begins to hunt the hunter. In the ensuing chaos the hare's child is burned by hot coffee.
In "Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher" (The Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb), a mother warns her son not to suck his thumbs. However, when she goes out of the house he resumes his thumb sucking, until a roving tailor appears and cuts off his thumbs with giant scissors.
"Die Geschichte vom Suppen-Kaspar" (The Story of Kaspar who did not have any Soup) begins as Kaspar, a healthy, strong boy, proclaims that he will no longer eat his soup. Over the next five days he wastes away and dies.
In "Die Geschichte vom Zappel-Philipp" (The Story of Fidgety Philip), a boy who won't sit still at dinner accidentally knocks all of the food onto the floor, to his parents' great displeasure.
"Die Geschichte von Hans Guck-in-die-Luft" (The Story of Johnny Head-in-Air) concerns a boy who habitually fails to watch where he's walking. One day he walks into a river; he is soon rescued, but his portfolio drifts away.
In "Die Geschichte vom fliegenden Robert" (The Story of Flying Robert), a boy goes outside during a storm. The wind catches his umbrella and sends him to places unknown, and presumably to his doom.

[edit] International curiosities
In one English version of "The Story of the Inky Boys" Nikolas is Tall Agrippa.
In the same version there are more differences - for instance "The Story of the Wild Huntsman" is now "The Story of the Man Who Went Out Shooting." In "The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches" (or "...Harriet and the Matches" in this version) the cats are not named. In other versions they are - the original German was "Minz" and "Maunz." Also in this version, "The Story of Kaspar who did not have any Soup" becomes "The Story of Augustus Who Would Not Have Any Soup."

[edit] Stage adaptations

Shockheaded Peter (1998) is a musical created by Julian Bleach, Anthony Cairns, Julian Crouch, Graeme Gilmour, Tamzin Griffin, Jo Pocock, Phelim McDermott, Michael Morris and The Tiger Lillies (Martyn Jacques, Adrian Huge and Adrian Stout). The production combines elements of pantomime and puppetry with musical versions of the poems with the songs generally following the text but with a somewhat darker tone. Whereas the children in the poems only sometimes die, in the musical they all do. Commissioned by the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds and the Lyric Hammersmith in West London, the show debuted in 1998 in Leeds before moving to London and subsequently to world tours.[3]


Struwwelpeter (2004), is a work for narrator and orchestra was staged in the Athens Concert Hall as the main Christmas program of Kamerata Orchestra of Friends of Music. The music was written by Alexandros Mouzas and was commissioned by the Athens Concert Hall. The production ran for 8 sold-out performances.[4]


Struwwelpeter - In English! (2006) was taken to the 60th Edinburgh Festival in August. The production used a variety of magic, mime, physical theatre, and black-comedy to recreate the tales. The show had a sell-out run and returned in 2007 for a second run of the sell out show. The show was directed and performed by Owen Daniel, Susie Ashfield, Isobelle Miller, Alexandra Gillam and Perran Crosley.


[edit] Influence and references

There is a Struwwelpeter museum in Frankfurt, Germany.


The comic book writer Grant Morrison drew inspiration from Struwwelpeter during his tenure on the DC comic Doom Patrol when inventing several enemy monsters. The Tailor from The Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb provided inspiration for the Scissormen in issues #19 to #22, where Struwwelpeter is quoted directly[citation needed], and apparitions named The Inky Boys and Flying Robert appear in #25, along with a special cameo appearance by a Scissorman.


W.H. Auden refers to the Scissor-Man in his 1930s poem "The Witnesses" (also known as "The Two") :

And now with sudden swift emergence
Come the women in dark glasses, the humpbacked surgeons
And the Scissor Man.

Adolf Hitler was parodied as a Struwwelpeter caricature in 1941 in a book called Struwwelhitler published in Britain under the pseudonym Dr. Schrecklichkeit (Dr. Horrors).


Jasper Fforde's book The Fourth Bear features a town with terrified, but obedient children, who always eat their soup, don't play with matches, and don't suck their thumbs. Some folks in town are actually missing their thumbs, courtesy of a scissor wielding maniac in red pants.


In M. J. Trow's pastiche The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade, the Scotland Yard detective investigates a continuing series of murders patterned after the Struwwelpeter cautionary tales.


In Hellblazer # 204, Struwwelpeter (Shockheaded Peter) is summoned to fight childhood fears. About him it is said that 'He was the worst, the scariest, so I made him be on my side'.


Dwight Schrute in The Office tries to read Struwwelpeter to several young children on "Take Your Daughter to Work Day."


Alan Moore created a rookie officer named "Shock-Headed Pete", who had electric current running through his head, for the America's Best Comics series Top 10.


In Rosetta Loy's La porta del acqua, 2000: Rizzoli; Milano, the infant persona's German governess Anne-Marie is continually reading blood-thirsty stories from Struwwelpeter


In 1999 the pagan-rock band Inkubus Sukkubus released a song entitled "Struwwelpeter" on the album "Wild (album)" released by Resurrection Records.


The song Hilf Mir by Rammstein is based on "Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug" (The Dreadful Story of Pauline and the Matches)
