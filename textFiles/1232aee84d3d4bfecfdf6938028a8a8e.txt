From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
A shock site is a website that is intended to be offensive, disgusting or disturbing to its viewers, containing materials of high shock value which is also considered distasteful and crude, and is generally of a pornographic, scatological, extremely violent, extremely profane, or extremely provocative nature.[1] Some shock sites display a single picture, animation, or video clip, or a small gallery, and are often passed around via email or disguised in posts to discussion sites as a hoax in an attempt to trick readers into following the link to the website (a bait and switch). Other shock sites are merely websites that openly display shocking material.
Some shock sites have also gained their own subcultures and have become internet memes on their own. Goatse.cx featured a page devoted to fan-submitted artwork and tributes to the site's hello.jpg[2], and a parody of the image was also shown by a BBC newscast as an alternative for the then recently unveiled logo for the 2012 Summer Olympics[3]. A shock video known as 2 Girls 1 Cup also quickly became an internet phenomenon, with videos of reactions, homages, and parodies widely posted on video sharing sites such as YouTube.[4]

[edit] Examples of shock sites

[edit] Goatse.cx
Main article: Goatse.cx
Goatse.cx[5] was one of the best-known shock sites, featuring an image, hello.jpg, of a man stretching his anus with his hands.
The original domain goatse.cx was deactivated by the NIC .cx authority in January 2004, but several mirror sites are currently up and running hosting the original content[6] (including the only currently active Top-level domain mirror: goatse.fr).

[edit] 2 Girls 1 Cup
Main article: 2 Girls 1 Cup
2 Girls 1 Cup (or Cupchicks) is a famous shock site/viral video portraying coprophilia. The site has garnered a great deal of attention on internet forums and video sites, spawning various reaction videos and parodies such as songs and animated versions.[4] Among these is a video showing comedian Joe Rogan's reaction to the clip[7] and a parody video featuring John Mayer.[8] The video was also brought up in an episode of VH1's Best Week Ever.[4]

[edit] Stile Project
Main article: Stile Project
Stile Project, which won a Webby Award in 2000 for Wired site and was a People's Voice winner,[9] evolved into a website with a lot of pornographic and extreme material; Wired referred to the website as a "shock site" in a 2001 article.[1]

[edit] Lemonparty.org
Lemonparty.org contains an image of three elderly men in a bed kissing and having oral sex. The image has been referenced in obscure and sometimes literal contexts in the media, such as a sketch on Talkshow with Spike Feresten,[10][11] dialog on 30 Rock.[12][13], a Moviefone interview with Michael Cera and Jonah Hill,[14] and a Young Hollywood interview with Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy.[15].

[edit] Last Measure
Last Measure is a shock site script written by the GNAA which utilizes Flash, Javascript, and Java to spawn pop-ups containing various shock images, attempt to launch IRC and E-mail clients, and playing a looping audio file that declares that the user is "looking at gay porno." Some installations can also take a user name parameter in the URL to track how many people have been sent to the site via a particular user.[16]
