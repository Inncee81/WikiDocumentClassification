Crysis is a science fiction first-person shooter video game developed by German video game developer Crytek Frankfurt and published by Electronic Arts, and is the first game of a planned trilogy.[4] It was released on November 2007. Well-received by critics, early NPD figures for the US market were taken as a sign that the game had flopped;[5] however, EA has recently reported being happy with sales, stating that the game has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.[6] A side-story expansion pack, Crysis Warhead, was released in September 2008.

[edit] Overview
Crysis is based in a future where an ancient alien spacecraft has been discovered beneath the Earth on an island near the coast of East Philippines.[7] The single-player campaign has the player assume the role of United States Delta Force operator Jake Dunn, referred to in-game by his call sign, Nomad. Nomad is armed with various futuristic weapons and equipment, most notably a "Nano Muscle Suit" which, according to Crytek senior game designer Bernd Diemer, was inspired by the United States' Future Force Warrior 2020 program[8] and other projects relating from the Natick Soldier Systems Center. In Crysis, the player fights both North Korean and extraterrestrial enemies, in four different locations: a tropical island jungle, inside an "Ice Sphere" (consisting of the same jungle, but frozen), the alien ship itself (with a zero-gravity area) and a United States Navy aircraft carrier. Crysis uses Microsoft's new API, Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) for graphics rendering, and includes the same editor that was used by Crytek to create the game.[9]
A standalone, but related, game titled Crysis Warhead, was announced on June 5, 2008.[10][11] It was released on Steam September 17, 2008.
Crysis, Crysis Warhead and Crysis Wars were re-released as a compilation pack titled Crysis Maximum Edition on March 10, 2009.[12]

[edit] Gameplay
As with Crytek's previous game Far Cry, Crysis is an open-ended game with many ways to meet objectives.[13] An addition to the previous Far Cry formula is that most weapons may be modified with devices such as suppressors, telescopic sights, and targeting lasers.
The protagonist, callsign Nomad, is also capable of selecting various modes in his military prototype "Nano Suit". The suit is capable of four modes: Armor (absorbing damage), strength, speed, and cloak.[14] Due to the ability of constantly regenerating health, the game is completely devoid of first aid kits. All of these actions, however, use rechargeable energy reserves that power the suit; health is recharged most quickly while in armor mode. The suit can be quickly switched between modes using a rapid mouse gesture system, which adds a strong tactical element to combat.
The suit's integral mask has its own HUD, displaying typical data like a tactical map and current energy levels. The view is electronic in nature, shown in-game through things such as a booting readout and visual distortion during abnormal operation. Onboard utilities include a two-way radio, PDA and audio-visual logging capability, with features like image zoom and night vision provided by optional equipment (given by default in single-player).
The artificial intelligence (AI) in Crysis also aims to be realistic and believable. Enemy soldiers employ tactical maneuvers, work as squads, hide and ambush amongst the scenery, and adapt to changing environments and conditions. AI soldiers will also respond to sound and subtle movements triggered by the player's movement.[15] While not engaged in combat, the AI soldiers will also exhibit typical and lifelike behavior, such as smoking, yawning, talking, urinating, patrolling, saluting superior officers, etc. Sometimes these actions depend on whether or not the player was detected earlier. If Nomad has not been sighted in some missions, he can find some enemies sleeping upon arriving to his destination. In contrast if he has been spotted they will all be alert.[16]

[edit] Weapons




An in-game screenshot of Crysis.


The game features assault rifles, sub-machine guns, pistols, LAWs, shotguns, miniguns, sniper rifles, gauss rifles, an Alien energy-based mini-gun like weapon (MOAC and MOAR attachment), and the TAC gun (a nuclear grenade launcher). As mentioned earlier, all weapons can be modified with attachments; these attachments may be given to the player by default, acquired from picked-up weapons, or purchased in multiplayer. Once acquired, they can only be removed through death or scripted loss of inventory: if in story mode, e.g. if during normal play, a player attaches a flashlight to a rifle which is later discarded, the flashlight is not considered gone and will still be available in the future.
Attachment options are given a fair amount of leeway even if the end result may seem strange. For instance, a 4x/10x sniper scope can be attached to the buckshot-firing shotgun. Additionally, most weapons have multiple firing modes (single/rapidfire) and different ammo types. Crysis also incorporates some features that have appeared in other recent shooters, such as being able to throw hand grenades without needing to formally equip them first, and accounting for already-chambered rounds when a reload occurs.

[edit] Plot
The game begins with the introduction of Raptor Team, a U.S. Army Special Forces unit. Playable character Nomad and his squad mates Psycho, Jester, Aztec, and Prophet perform a halo jump onto one of the Lingshan Islands. The tropical island (off the Eastern Philippines) and its surrounding water space comprise the setting. Raptor Team is ordered to respond to a distress signal sent by American archaeologists, who where excavating mysterious dig sites. The artifacts discovered pre-date man.
It is August 2020 and North Korea has become a major economic and nuclear power. North Korean military forces (KPA) occupy the islands and hold several U.S. citizens in custody. Because of the U.S. Military's open combat against the KPA, it is presumed that the nations are in some state of war.
Nomad is ordered to disrupt local KPA forces through a variety of guerrilla maneuvers. Along the way Aztec and Jester are brutally killed along with several North Korean soldiers by an unknown entity. Major Strickland, a U.S. Marine Corps officer, provides Nomad with short-term combat objectives throughout the day. Nomad rescues an American CIA operative who posed as an archaeologist during her investigation of the KPA's dig site interest. The primary objective is completed when head archaeologist Dr. Rosenthal is found hostage - though forced to continue his research - in a KPA camp. Nomad witnesses him arguing into a video uplink with North Korean General Kyong and his daughter Helena, also a hostage at another excavation site. The unknown artifact next to Dr. Rosenthal activates itself, freezing the surroundings with a massive energy explosion. Rosenthal is killed, frozen in pose, as is anyone else in the vicinity. Nomad's prototype Nanosuit retains its internal temperature capable of insulating him from the blast.
He is ordered to move to an evac position and is transported by VTOL to a new combat zone - which incorporates tank warfare and encounters with North Korean soldiers outfitted in similar Nanosuits (though commented to be cheap knockoffs).
Nomad fights alongside the U.S. Marines toward General Kyong's position inside the island's central mountain. During the extensive approach battle, the mountain experiences massive tremors and begins to collapse, revealing a two kilometer-high alien structure inside. The U.S. Marines are halted by an earthquake on their line of approach and Nomad proceeds alone. After dismantling the KPA military outside a mine entrance, alien machines fly into the fray and begin to attack any and all humans. With the arrival of Stickland's support units, Nomad proceeds inside the mine shaft to find Kyong and Helena. He is taken captive by Kyong's bodyguards and forced to witness the General's activation of the mountain structure despite Helena's pleas. Kyong declares that his only interest is in the alien technology for an unmitigated power source and states that if not North Korea, the United States would be doing the same thing. A resulting energy pulse kills Kyong's guards, allowing Nomad to kill General Kyong himself. The mountain continues to collapse and Helena is rescued by VTOL which is forced to leave before Nomad can board. He decides to enter the alien structure in hope of a way out.
The interior of the structure becomes zero gravity and Nomad floats his way through the crystallized interiors. He encounters and fights with the sapient aliens in various cabins of their elaborate technology. Upon escaping the structure out the side of the mountain, Nomad finds that the aliens have flash-frozen the surrounding environment inside a -200° energy sphere. All lives within the sphere are killed, including two platoons of U.S. Marines, and again Nomad survives due to his Nanosuit. He runs into Prophet, who fights off alien mechanized attackers with one of their own ice weapons. Much of the alien technology is cryo-oriented, alluding to the temperature of their natural habitat. Nomad and Prophet exit the sphere as an alien warship flies overhead. They meet up with a U.S. Marine officer, Lieutenant Keegan, along with his remaining platoon of Marines. The group begins to their way to the evacuation site. Helena is rescued from her crashed VTOL on the way, and first contact is made with a large alien machine. The machine cannot be stopped and attacks the retreating units. Major Strickland allows Nomad to escape on the last VTOL aircraft by creating a distraction, killing himself in the process. The prior engagements with the North Korean military seem petty in comparison to the immediate and indiscriminate threat the aliens pose.
The aircraft's pilot is killed and Nomad takes the controls for an evacuation mission. They successfully return to the USS Constitution carrier strike group and are debriefed by Richard Morrison, a U.S. Navy Admiral. Prophet begins to show symptoms of post-traumatic stress and maniacally returns on his own to the island, stealing a VTOL aircraft in the process. Despite this, Admiral Morrison follows the orders of the White House and Joint Chiefs of Staff, launching a nuclear missile at the sphere. Helena makes a futile argument against this, theorizing that the aliens would absorb the energy created by the nuclear explosion. Indeed, this is exactly what happens. The nuclear attack provokes the aliens to launch an all-out offensive against the carrier strike group. The USS Constitution is severely damaged, prompting Nomad to perform both combat and repair objectives. Admiral Morrison is killed after the crew abandons ship. Nomad secures a "TAC cannon," a hand-held tactical nuclear warhead launcher. The final battle pits him against an alien war ship appearing off the port side, which dwarfs the aircraft carrier in size. Helena helps to deter the alien technology with an energy transmission resonated from Nomad's Nanosuit. After the war ship is destroyed, Nomad escapes the sinking carrier in a VTOL piloted by Psycho, with Helena on board too. They fly off to rendezvous with a U.S. Navy fleet from Japan but reroute back to the island when Prophet is found to still be alive. The game ends on a cliffhanger as Nomad states that they now have the ability (the energy transmission) to stop the enemy.

[edit] Vehicles
A large selection of vehicles are present, with most being available to players for personal use. Available ground vehicles range from pickup trucks to tanks, while naval vessels range from motorboats to light military hovercraft. All vehicles (Humvees, pickup trucks, and even tanks) have a turbo mode that can be activated via the sprint key. The aircraft selection is limited to one North Korean attack helicopter and a fictional American VTOL aircraft, each of which can transport eight passengers and two crew. Crytek also included an Amphibious APC vehicle, a version of the ICV that can travel on water and land. The vehicle was only available for those who pre-ordered the game, however.
Damage modeling is limited in wheeled vehicles, most noticeably the ability to burst their tires. Tracked vehicles such as tanks or APCs have the ability to lose their tracks as well, but maintain their ability to operate via the wheels which would normally drive the tracks. Exposed gas cans on vehicles can also be shot at to detonate their contents, usually resulting in the vehicle exploding as well. Flaming wrecks will cause proximity heat damage to objects and characters. Of note is that a vehicle can still run even if all the tires are gone, slowly rolling along on its rims. Unavailable vehicles shown in-game include jet aircraft, excavator, forklift and for reasons of scale, destroyers. None of the alien machines can be commandeered by players either.

[edit] Multiplayer

Up to 32 players are supported in each multiplayer match in Crysis. There are two different modes, each with six available maps: Instant Action, a deathmatch type mode; and Power Struggle, which are played by two opposing teams, each trying to destroy the other's headquarters.[17]
Power Struggle features the American Delta Force soldiers fighting the North Korean Army; both sides, however, have nanosuits.[18] All players begin armed with only a pistol and a basic nanosuit. [19][18] In order to purchase weapons and vehicles, the player must complete objectives, or kill enemies.
The aim of Power Struggle is to destroy the enemy headquarters, a task which is achieved using nuclear weapons in the form of a TAC Tank, a TAC launcher, or a Singularity Tank. To gain access to the nuclear weapons, you must first capture the facility which is used to make them, and then the alien crash sites which feed the facility the energy necessary to build them. It is arguable that the Singularity Tank is the best for taking out an enemy base, due to the fact that it has infinite ammo, with the same power as the TAC tank, able to take out the enemy HQ in two hits.
One must earn Prestige Points, attained by killing enemies and taking over Bunkers, Power Stations, and Factories, to create any of the aforementioned superweapons. Apart from the superweapons, other things able to be bought are machine guns, pistols, a shotgun, a precision rifle, ammo, a rocket launcher, and explosives. As well as weapons, one may buy add-ons such as laser sights, silencers and sniper scopes, or buy field equipment such as Night-Vision Goggles, Binoculars, and Parachutes. Vehicles that are able to be purchased at War Factories are Humvees, AA vehicles, APC's, Tanks, and Gauss Tanks. To purchase patrol boats, amphibious vehicles and other watercraft, a Naval Factory is required. You can also purchase helicopters and VTOLs at Aircraft Factories.
The advanced weapons available for purchase from the Prototype Factory (aside from nuclear weapons) require 50% energy . Weapons that you can buy are the handheld minigun, the MOAC which has infinite amno and fires ice shards, and you can also buy the MOAR which is an upgrade that can be attached to the MOAC causing it to fire a beam that will instantly freeze all enemies and some vehicles.
Capture The Flag, originally planned to be included in the game, is no longer part of the game mode line up, due to its similarity to Power Struggle.[18] Even so, Jack Mamais, a Crytek employee, stated that Crytek hopes that this mode will be developed by the modding community.[20] Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli also said that Team Action would not be included as a multiplayer mode, because players would gravitate towards either Instant Action, or Power Struggle.[21]

[edit] Factions

[edit] United States Military

[edit] United States Army
Raptor Team is the U.S. Army Delta Force unit that the protagonist, Nomad, is a part of. At full strength, it consisted of five men, Aztec, Jester, Psycho, Nomad and the team leader, Prophet. The true names of the characters are revealed in the CryEngine 2 Sandbox 2 editor that comes with the game. Aztec and Jester die quickly during the course of the game, leaving just three alive. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) is their ultimate overseer, though later in the game they are more directly in touch with USS Constitution personnel.

Nomad (First Lieutenant Jake Dunn): The player character. His face is unseen throughout the game, and he pursues mission goals with single-minded fervor. The player assumes this role throughout the game, and other than the end of the last cutscene, the entire game is viewed from Nomad's perspective.


Psycho (Sergeant Michael Sykes): A former British SAS Operative, who later joined Delta Force. He tends to use British English, and has the SAS insignia tattooed on the back of his head. Psycho survives the initial events and assists Nomad for the rest of the game. Psycho's solo adventures form the basis of the standalone expansion, Crysis Warhead, in which he assumes the role of protagonist.


Prophet (Major Laurence Barnes): The Raptor squad's leader, who after some time into the game is kidnapped by an alien machine and presumed killed; at that point, Major Strickland assumes mission command. He miraculously reappears at the point of the story where Nomad exits the alien ship, but exhibiting strange behavior. After this he seems to have a much deeper understanding of the aliens than anyone else, having jerry-rigged a complex alien turret into a man-portable weapon not unlike a minigun. At the end of the game, he heads back to the island directly against orders, announcing that he intends to destroy the aliens himself. He is again assumed to be killed when the U.S. Navy nukes the island, but at the end of the game Nomad and Psycho receive a transmission from Prophet, still alive on the island, and head back to find him. When he is last seen in the armory, it is mentioned that he upgraded his thrusters, which were used by Nomad in the alien complex to balance himself in zero gravity.


Jester (Martin Hawker): Also present at the beginning while at the site of a strange discovery, a boat far inland and frozen, he is captured by an alien machine. It takes him a short distance away before discarding him, at which point his mutilated body is discovered.


Aztec (Harold Cortez): Part of the initial team, he is brutally killed by an alien at the start of the game along with a four-man KPA patrol.


[edit] United States Marine Corps
Locally led by Major Strickland, the USMC contributes most of the ground military hardware in the game along with the Marines themselves. They operate from the USS Constitution carrier strike group, deploying via a sizable number of United States Navy VTOL Aircraft. Major Strickland takes over mission command after Prophet goes missing, but himself falls in battle later on: to distract a massive alien machine from attacking nearby evacuating aircraft, he deliberately stays behind to draw its attention, sacrificing himself.

[edit] United States Navy
Represented in-game by the USS Constitution carrier strike group, they are led by Admiral Richard Morrison, USN. All of the American aircraft seen throughout the game belong to the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy also seem to be in possession of considerable ordnance, as seen when they deploy an F-35C fighter jet armed with a nuclear missile. The carrier strike group meets its ultimate demise at the hands of relentless waves of alien machines and also a massive alien "War Ship". At the conclusion of the game Helena informs Nomad that there is another fleet of U.S. Navy ships en route from Yokosuka, Japan that will arrive within the hour.

[edit] Rosenthal's Team
Doctor Rosenthal's archeology team is on the island to search for remnants of the alien race he discovered clues of elsewhere in the world at the behest of North Korea. He brings with him his daughter Helena (also a scientist), another scientist named Badowski, an unnamed scientist and unknowingly, a CIA agent sent to secretly monitor him. The CIA agent is rescued by Raptor Team during the hidden alien spaceship's first ominous rumblings early in the game and is not seen again. The scientist Badowski is the first to be killed, found by Nomad in the jungle with numerous ice shards lodged in his back. Dr. Rosenthal is killed when he is flash-frozen by a flying alien craft that he excavated and it intermittently activates. Helena's unnamed colleague is shot in the head by General Kyong after Kyong doesn't have any use for him anymore. Helena survives and will likely feature in any sequels.

[edit] North Korean People's Army
In the game, it is mentioned that North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Il was superseded by his son, Kim Jong-chul sometime in 2008. Kim revolutionizes the North Korean economy making it one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of technodollars. Using this new wealth the KPA buys the newest military hardware from China, making it a formidable power. In the game, it is also mentioned that North Korea has a fully developed nuclear program.[22]
The North Koreans in the game are led by Colonel General Ri-Chan Kyong, an infamous North Korean military officer. Their intent to hang onto the islands is clear, shown by the significant allocation of forces ranging from infantry to tanks and aircraft. According to Kyong, the North Koreans are interested in the archaeological findings because of the potential to use the alien technology as a profitable power source. It is later revealed that they have nanosuit technology, which Nomad reports as "look like cheap knockoffs". Their nanosuits are limited solely to Kyong himself and his elite personal guard. Kyong is encountered midway during the game as a boss character, complete with nanosuit.

[edit] Aliens




Aliens attacking U.S. forces, a short distance outside the ice sphere.


Operating out of their massive ship embedded in the rock, the aliens themselves have streamlined bodies with which they "swim" through the weightless internal environment. Their organic-looking war machines comprise the bulk of their forces, ranging from small ones able to maneuver indoors to flying machines and massive war ships that can sink destroyers by ramming them head-on. The massive number of machines that deploy at the end of the game, along with filler text for multiplayer maps, indicate their interest in Earth is on a global scale[citation needed].
In terms of offensive technology, most of their weapons are portrayed as being centered on coldness, shown in-game by the presence of weapons that either freeze targets outright or launch ice shards at high speed. These weapons do not require ammunition in-game, merely having a short "cooldown" time after periods of prolonged firing. They do, however, have weapons outside of this type, such as the sci-fi "Singularity Cannon", or more traditional implements such as directly built-in blades and spikes. Some unarmored aliens, which Nomad encounters in the alien ship, also use smaller, weaker versions of the larger aliens' MOACs that have a traditional blaster-like design. These aliens also use melee attacks.

[edit] Game engine
Main article: CryEngine 2
Crysis uses a new engine—the CryEngine 2—that is the successor to Far Cry's CryEngine. CryEngine 2 is among the first engines to use the Direct3D 10 (DirectX 10) framework of Windows Vista, but can also run using DirectX 9, both on Vista and Windows XP.[24]
Roy Taylor, Vice President of Content Relations at NVIDIA, has spoken on the subject of the engine's complexity, stating that Crysis has over a million lines of code, 1 GB of texture data, and 85,000 shaders.[4]

[edit] Demo
On August 27, 2007, Crytek announced a single-player demo would be released on September 25; however, the date was pushed back to October 26.[25][26] The demo featured the entire first level, Contact, as well as the sand box editor.[27][28] On October 26, Crytek announced that the demo would be postponed for at least one more day and was released to the public on October 27.[27] However, on many sites it was provided a day early, and an oversight allowed people to grab the file directly off an EA server earlier than intended.
Shortly after the demo's release some enthusiasts found that, by manipulating the configuration files, most of the “very high” graphics settings (normally reserved for DX10) could be activated under DX9. The "very high" DX9 graphics mode looks almost identical to the DX10 mode, with certain graphical features not being able to be reproduced correctly under DX9, such as Object Motion Blur.[29]

[edit] Sandbox editor
Main article: Sandbox (video game editor)




The Crysis Sandbox editor.


Crysis contains a level editor called Sandbox, much like Far Cry's, in which new levels can be created and edited. Such levels will have full support in all multiplayer modes. This will allow the player to easily build their own levels, seeing everything in real time within the editor. The player can also jump into the map they are working on at any time to test it. The editor is the same one that was used by Crytek to create the game.[30]
As stated in the readme file accompanying Sandbox, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition or Windows Vista x64 are the only officially supported operating systems for running the editor. According to Crytek, using a 32-bit OS can lead to instabilities with production size levels due to the low amount of virtual memory available and is therefore not supported.

Crysis was awarded a 98% in the PC Gamer U.S. Holiday 2007 issue, making it one of the highest rated games ever in PC Gamer, tying with Half-Life 2 and Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.[43] The UK edition of the magazine awarded the game 92%, describing the game as "A spectacular and beautiful sci-fi epic." GameSpot awarded Crysis a score of 9.5 out of 10, describing it as "easily one of the greatest shooters ever made."[39] GameSpy gave it a 4.5 out of 5 stating that the suit powers were fun but also criticizing the multiplayer portion of the game for not having a team deathmatch.[40]. X-Play gave it a 3 out of 5 on its "Holiday Buyer's Guide" special episode, praising the graphics and physics, but criticized the steep hardware requirements as well as stating that the game is overhyped with average gameplay.[45] GamePro honored Crysis with a score of 4.75 out of 5, saying it was "a great step forward for PC gaming," but criticized the steep hardware requirements.[38] IGN awarded it a 9.4 out of 10, hailing it as "one of the more entertaining ballistic showdowns in quite some time."[42]

[edit] Awards
GameSpot awarded Crysis Best Shooter in its Best of 2007 awards, saying that "It was this open-ended, emergent gameplay--the ability to let us tackle our challenges in whatever way we wished." They also awarded it with Best Graphics: Technical and Best PC Game stating that "The firefights in the game are beautiful to look at, but extremely intense affairs that force you to think quickly--and reward you for doing so. It's a dynamic game, one that you can play several times to discover new things and to experiment with different approaches."[46]
PC Gamer awarded Crysis Game Of The Year and Action Game Of The Year in its March 2008, Games of the Year Awards issue. PC Gamer also remarked that "Crysis has pushed PC gaming to a new plateau, marrying the most advanced graphics engine ever created with phenomenal gameplay. From the cinematic opening to credits to its cliffhanger ending, Crysis is mesmerizing."
Gamereactor — who gave Crysis a perfect ten — awarded Crysis Best Action Game of 2007, saying that "the action genre is forever changed."
IGN awarded Crysis its Editor's Choice Award, saying that "the Halo 2 type ending... wasn’t enough to deter me from heartily recommending action fans pick this one up."

[edit] Sales
As of June 27, 2008, Crysis has beaten EA's expectations and sold 1.5 million copies worldwide, according to EA.[6]

[edit] Sequels
Crysis was announced to be the first game in a trilogy by Crytek.[4] It is expected that the sequel will continue where the first game ended. In addition to seeking a United States trademark on the name Crysis,[47] Crytek is seeking to trademark the names Crysis Wars,[48] World in Crysis,[49] and Crysis Warhead. While it is possible that a sequel is in development, GameSpot commented that the trademarks also "could be nothing."[50] However, Crysis Warhead turned out to be the title of the next Crysis game, and Crysis Wars the name for the multiplayer mode in Warhead. Also, in a recent interview with GameSpot developers at Crytek said that "Crysis Wars" was a standalone multiplayer game with many new enhancements to the original multiplayer of Crysis (with inclusion of team deathmatch as a major feature apart from many others of similar scope).
On June 4, 2008, a teaser image of Crysis Warhead was on the main Crysis website.[51] On June 5, EA and Crytek released more information about the game through a press release. Crysis Warhead was released for Microsoft Windows on September 16, 2008 in North America and September 19, 2008 in Europe. The multiplayer element of Crysis Warhead is now called Crysis Wars.[52]
