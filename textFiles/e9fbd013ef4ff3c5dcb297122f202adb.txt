[edit] Cardinal and theological virtues
The seven virtues of Christian theology consist of a combination of the four Cardinal virtues and the three Theological virtues.


Type
Virtue
Meaning


Cardinal
Prudence
proper judgment of reasons for action with regard to appropriateness in a context


Cardinal
Justice
proper judgment regarding individual human interests, rights and deserts


Cardinal
Restraint or Temperance
practicing self-control, abstention, and moderation


Cardinal
Courage or Fortitude
forbearance, endurance, and ability to confront fear and uncertainty, or intimidation


Theological
Faith
steadfastness in belief


Theological
Hope
expectation of good


Theological
Love or Charity
selfless, unconditional, and voluntary loving-kindness


The cardinal virtues were derived initially from Plato's scheme (see Protagoras 330b, which also includes piety (hosiotes)) and adapted by Saint Ambrose, Augustine of Hippo, and Thomas Aquinas (see Summa Theologica II(I).61). The term "cardinal" comes from the Latin cardo or hinge; the cardinal virtues are so called because they are hinges upon which the door of the moral life swings.
The theological virtues are so named because the object of these virtues is the divine being (theos). Other virtues have vice at their extremes, and are only virtues when they are maintained between these extremes. In the case of the Theological Virtues, they do not contribute to vice at the positive extreme; that is, there is no vice in having an unlimited amount of faith, hope, or love, when God is the object of that virtue. They occur in the Bible at 1 Corinthians 13:13:

"And now abideth faith, hope, and love, even these three: but the chiefest of these is love". (Geneva Bible, 1560).


[edit] Seven heavenly virtues
There is another list of the seven virtues to oppose the seven deadly sins. The "Seven heavenly virtues" were derived from the Psychomachia ("Contest of the Soul"), an epic poem written by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius (c. AD 410) entailing the battle of good virtues and evil vices. The intense popularity of this work in the Middle Ages helped to spread the concept of holy virtue throughout Europe. Practicing these virtues is considered to protect one against temptation from the seven deadly sins, with each one having its counterpart. Due to this they are sometimes referred to as the contrary virtues. Each of the seven heavenly virtues matches a corresponding deadly sin.
