Nvu (pronounced "N-view") is a discontinued[1][2] WYSIWYG HTML editor[3], based on the Composer component of Mozilla Application Suite and Gecko 1.7. It is a common WYSIWYG editor for Linux and is intended to be an open source equivalent to proprietary software like Microsoft Expression Web and Adobe Dreamweaver (although to date it is missing many features they possess). As a WYSIWYG editor, it is designed to be easy for novice users and does not require any knowledge of HTML or CSS to use.
The project was started by and sponsored by Linspire. Linspire hired Daniel Glazman, former Netscape Communications Corporation employee and CEO/Founder of Disruptive Innovations, to be lead developer.
Nvu is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, and it can be built successfully on any platform with the Netscape Portable Runtime.
Nvu may sometimes be spelled "N|vu" to simulate the line in the logo, much like CNET is often written as "C|Net".

[edit] Development
The original plan in June 2005 was to merge back the numerous changes into Mozilla Composer's source code tree. Since then the Mozilla Suite has been discontinued (then reintroduced as SeaMonkey), and no one merged the Nvu code back into Composer.
Daniel Glazman announced in the course of 2006 that he has stopped official development on Nvu and he would be developing a successor to it. In September 2008 he announced BlueGriffon ([5]), written from scratch and based on Mozilla Gecko 1.9.x and XULRunner.[4]
A community-driven WYSIWYG HTML editor fork, KompoZer, maintains Nvu codebase and fixes bugs until a successor to Nvu is released.

[edit] Standards compliance




Nvu CSS editor


Nvu complies with the W3C's web standards. By default, pages are created in accordance to HTML 4.01 Transitional and use CSS for styling, but the user can change the settings and choose between:

Strict and transitional DTD's
HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0
CSS styling or the old <font> based styling.

The application includes a built-in HTML validator, which uploads pages to the W3C's HTML Validator and checks for compliance.
