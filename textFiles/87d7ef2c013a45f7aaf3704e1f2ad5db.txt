From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The Z notation (formally pronounced /zɛd/), named after Zermelo-Fränkel set theory, is a formal specification language used for describing and modeling computing systems. It is targeted at the clear specification of computer programs and the formulation of proofs about the intended program behavior.

[edit] History
In 1974, Jean-Raymond Abrial published "Data Semantics" in Data Base Management (Klimbie, Koffeman, eds), North-Holland, pp 1-59. He used a notation that would later be taught in the Université de Grenoble until the end of the eighties. In EDF (Electricité De France), Abrial wrote internal notes on Z. The Z notation is used in the book of Meyer and Baudouin, Méthodes de programmation, published by Eyrolles in 1980.
Z was originally proposed Abrial in 1977 with the help of Steve Schuman and Bertrand Meyer [1]. It was developed further at the Programming Research Group at Oxford University, where Abrial worked in the early eighties (he arrived in Oxford on September 1979).
Abrial answers the question "Why Z?" with "Because it is the ultimate language!"

[edit] Usage and Notation
Z is based on the standard mathematical notation used in axiomatic set theory, lambda calculus, and first-order predicate logic. All expressions in Z notation are typed, thereby avoiding some of the paradoxes of naive set theory. Z contains a standardized catalog (called the mathematical toolkit) of commonly used mathematical functions and predicates.
Although Z notation uses many non-ASCII symbols, the specification includes suggestions for rendering the Z notation symbols in ASCII and in LaTeX. A Z ttf font is also available for free download.

[edit] Standards
The ISO completed a Z standardization effort in 2002. This standard can be obtained directly from ISO.[2]
