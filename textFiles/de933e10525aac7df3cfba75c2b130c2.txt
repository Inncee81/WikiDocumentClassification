NetStumbler (also known as Network Stumbler) is a tool for Windows that facilitates detection of Wireless LANs using the 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g WLAN standards. It runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems from Windows 2000 to Windows XP. A trimmed-down version called MiniStumbler is available for the handheld Windows CE operating system.
The program is commonly used for:

Wardriving
Verifying network configurations
Finding locations with poor coverage in a WLAN
Detecting causes of wireless interference
Detecting unauthorized ("rogue") access points
Aiming directional antennas for long-haul WLAN links

NetStumbler's author, Marius Milner, maintains the occasionally-updated stumbler.net website where you can download the software. Another website, netstumbler.com, has more frequently updated information and wireless news.
There has been no further development of the application since 2004.[citation needed]

[edit] Alternatives

Inssider was created as an open-source alternative to Network Stumbler for the current generation of Windows operating system
Kismet (software) for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Mac OS X.
