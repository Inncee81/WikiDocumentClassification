Vuze (formerly Azureus) is a free BitTorrent client used to transfer files via the BitTorrent protocol. Vuze is written in Java, and uses the Azureus Engine. In addition to bittorrenting, Vuze allows users to view, publish and share original DVD and HD quality video content.[1] Content is presented through channels and categories containing TV shows, music videos, movies, video games and others. Additionally, if users prefer to publish their original content, they may monetize it.
Vuze was first released as Azureus in June 2003 at SourceForge.net, mostly to experiment with the Standard Widget Toolkit from Eclipse. It is now a highly popular BitTorrent client.[2] The Azureus engine is released under the GNU General Public License, and is free software. However, parts of the recently added Vuze platform carry more restricted licensing terms, and it is no longer possible to install the Azureus engine using the latest installer without first accepting the Vuze license.

[edit] Interface

[edit] Main Vuze interface
Since version 3.0, Vuze starts with the main Vuze interface, designed to promote Vuze content. Here, you can browse media on the Vuze Network, share torrents with friends, and chat. Everything from the classic UI is still available, although hidden, under the advanced vuze interface (see below). Vuze requires a registered account to take advantage of certain content on the Vuze Network.

[edit] Classic interface




Vuze swarm feature (shown in Classic UI)


Users upgrading from previous versions will automatically keep the classic interface. For those who are installing for the first time or re-installing, it is possible to bypass the Vuze layer by going to Tools>Options, Interface>Start> and selecting "Classic Interface" from the VUZE UI Chooser.
The main noticeable difference between the classic interface and the main interface is the header and footer. In addition, Vuze Network features are unavailable.
While downloading a file under the classic or advanced interface, the user can view several different statistics including:[3]

Current download and upload speeds and estimated time remaining.
The percentage of each file completed and information on the "pieces" (small parts of the complete file) still needed including the piece number and availability.
File names, sizes and levels of completion for specific files within the download directory.
Peer data including IP addresses, the speeds at which you are downloading and uploading to/from them, the port they are running BitTorrent on, and the BitTorrent client they are using.
The total and average "swarm speeds".
Advanced statistics including ratio, overall upload/download, session upload/download, network, upload/download limit estimate, cache activity, and distributed database details.


[edit] Advanced interface
The "advanced" interface is a mix between the classic and main interface. Noticeable differences include a change of header and footer, and the preservation of the Vuze Network layer. It can be changed via the UI chooser, or by clicking advanced in the Vuze/Main UI.

[edit] Plugins
Vuze also offers a range of plugins including:

Auto-speed plug-in
Mainline DHT tracking plug-in

[edit] Azureus




Azureus


Vuze was first released in June 2003 at SourceForge.net as Azureus. The Blue Poison Dart Frog (Dendrobates azureus) was chosen as the logo and named by co-creator Tyler Pitchford. This choice was due to Latin names of poison dart frogs being used as codenames for his development projects.

[edit] Vuze
In 2006 "Vuze" (aka Zudeo) was released as an attempt to transform the client into a "social" client by a group of the original developers forming Azureus Inc., shortly to be renamed Vuze, Inc. A Vuze-free version of Azureus was released along with Vuze during the beta period. The releases used version numbers 3.0, while the Vuze-free versions continued with the 2.5 release numbers. The first reaction to the change was met with confusion, because of this.[6] In addition, some of the developers voiced opposition to the idea of completely transforming the client.[citation needed] Starting with an unknown version, Vuze was coupled with Azureus. Soon after, "NoVuze" modified versions were released on The Pirate Bay, and as of September 15, are available for versions up to 3.1.1.0. On June 16, 2008, the developers of Azureus/Vuze decided to stop releasing versions named Azureus, and complete the name change with the release of version 3.1. The client engine however, remains unchanged as Azureus.

[edit] License change
Up to version 2.5.0.4, Azureus was distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL); beginning with the version 3 distribution, the licence presented upon installation changed. While it still states that the "Azureus Application" is available under the GPL, completing installation requires the user to agree to the terms of the "Vuze Platform", which include restrictions on use, reverse-engineering[7], and sublicensing[8]. As with many similar licenses, the Azureus licence includes a prohibition on use of the software by people "under the age of 18".[9] Allegedly, the TOS only applies to the website, vuze.com, and not the software[10], however the actual TOS include the application as part of the platform.[11].
