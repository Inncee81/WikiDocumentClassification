Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare (born 11 January 1934), commonly known as Tony Hoare or C.A.R. Hoare, is a British computer scientist, probably best known for the development in 1960 of Quicksort (or Hoaresort), one of the world's most widely used sorting algorithms. He also developed Hoare logic for verifying program correctness, and the formal language Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) used to specify the interactions of concurrent processes (including the Dining philosophers problem) and the inspiration for the Occam programming language.

[edit] Biography
Born in Colombo (Ceylon, now Sri Lanka) to British parents, he received his Bachelor's degree in Classics from the University of Oxford (Merton College) in 1956. He remained an extra year at Oxford studying graduate-level statistics, and following his National Service in the Royal Navy (1956–1958). When he learned to speak Russian, he studied computer translation of human languages at Moscow State University in the Soviet Union in the school of Kolmogorov.
In 1960, he left the Soviet Union and began working at Elliott Brothers, Ltd, a small computer manufacturing firm, where he implemented ALGOL 60 and began developing algorithms in earnest.[1] He became a Professor of Computing Science at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1968, and in 1977 moved back to Oxford as a Professor of Computing to lead the Programming Research Group in the Oxford University Computing Laboratory, following the death of Christopher Strachey. He is now an Emeritus Professor there, and is also a senior researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England.
The famous quote, "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil", by Donald Knuth,[2] has also been attributed to him (by Knuth himself),[3] although Hoare disclaims having coined the phrase.[4]

[edit] Awards

He received the 1980 ACM Turing Award for "his fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages". The award was presented to him at the ACM Annual Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, on 27 October 1980, by Walter Carlson, Chairman of the Awards committee. A transcript of Hoare's speech was published in Communications of the ACM.[1]
Harry H. Goode Memorial Award in 1981
In 1982 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society
On December 18th, 1987, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science by the Queen's University Belfast.
In 2000 he was knighted for services to education and computer science.
In 2000 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize for Information Science.
In 2005 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering
On Oct 13, 2006, the Computer History Museum (CHM) in Mountain View, California inducted him as Fellow of the Museum "for development of the Quicksort algorithm and for lifelong contributions to the theory of programming languages".
He received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from the Department of Informatics of the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB) on September 24th, 2007, in Athens, Greece.
