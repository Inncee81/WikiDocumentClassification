The WTFPL (Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License) is an uncommonly used, extremely permissive free software license, the March 2000 Version 1.0[2] was written by Banlu Kemiyatorn who used it for Window Maker artwork.[3] Samuel “Sam” Hocevar, a French programmer who was the Debian GNU/Linux project leader from 17 April 2007 to 16 April 2008 wrote version 2.0.[4][5] It allows for redistribution and modification of the software under any terms—the licensee is encouraged to “do what the fuck [they] want to”. The license was approved as a GPL-compatible free software license by the Free Software Foundation.[1]

[edit] Uses of the WTFPL
The WTFPL is not an exceedingly popular license, but some software has been released. In addition, the license can be applied to artwork and written material as well.[6] Freshmeat, an index of free software, includes a specific category for WTFPL software and artwork, containing nine entries as of March 2009[update],[7] of which four are authored by Sam Hocevar, the author of the 2.0 license.
