World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories claim that the complete structural failure of the World Trade Center towers was not caused by the plane crash damage that occurred as part of the September 11, 2001 attacks, nor by the fire damage that followed, but by explosives planted in the buildings in advance.[1] They were first suggested in late 2001 and have since become increasingly important to the 9/11 Truth Movement, but are rejected by those in the mainstream media and the mainstream engineering community who have looked at the theories.
The most detailed theories have come from physicist Steven Jones, architect Richard Gage, software engineer Jim Hoffman, theologian David Ray Griffin, and author Webster Griffin Tarpley. Proponents argue that the aircraft impacts and resulting fires could not have weakened the buildings sufficiently to initiate collapse and that the buildings would in any case not have collapsed as completely, and quickly as they did without an additional source of destructive energy to undermine their structure. Various sources of this energy have been proposed; the use of thermite, explosives, or some combination thereof is the most common suggestion being made today.[2][3][4]
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has rejected the idea that collapse due to fire would be impossible, as has the engineering community.[5][6][7]

History
Controlled demolition conspiracy theory proponents cite mainstream news reports on the day of the attacks that suggested explosions and secondary devices.[8] Journalists and experts commenting on the events as they happened mentioned that the World Trade Center collapses looked like those caused by intentionally planted explosives. ABC News anchor Peter Jennings said "Anybody who ever watched a building being demolished on purpose knows that if you're going to do this you have to get at the under infrastructure of a building and bring it down"[9] While watching footage of the collapse of WTC 7, CBS News anchor Dan Rather said "For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down."[citation needed] Some of these suggestions would later be retracted or revised.
In a notable example, the Albuquerque Journal quoted Dr. Van D. Romero, an engineer who said that the collapses looked "too methodical" and that "some explosive devices inside ... caused the towers to collapse". Remero speculated that the collision of the planes into the towers was a diversionary attack as part of a common terrorist strategy intended to attract emergency personnel to the scene, followed by the detonation of "a relatively small amount of explosives placed in strategic points" of the towers as the primary attack.[10] He soon withdrew this assessment[11] and later said he had been misquoted: "I only said that that's what it looked like." On September 22, 2001, the Albuquerque Journal printed a retraction.[12]
Engineers were in fact initially surprised by the collapses[13][14][15] and at least one considered explosives as a possible explanation.[16] The broad outlines of an explanation that did not involve such explosives quickly emerged, however, and took its current shape in the 2005 NIST report.[17][18] It has come to be known as "the official account of 911" or "the official conspiracy theory" among proponents of controlled demolition.[19]
The theory was first suggested in October 2001.[1] An early book-length treatment of the hypothesis[20] inspired both David Ray Griffin's critical inquiry[19] as well as the Popular Mechanics investigation of 9/11 conspiracy theories.[12] In late 2005, Brigham Young University Professor of Physics Steven Jones made his own pursuit of the theory public.[2] BYU responded to Jones' "increasingly speculative and accusatory" statements by placing him on paid leave in September, 2006, pending a review. Jones' elected to take early retirement.[21][22][23][24]
Proponents of the controlled demolition have questioned the "pancake collapse" theory originally suggested by FEMA[25] which the NIST also rejected and finally replaced with the current column failure theory.[18]
In its final report, NIST stated that it "found no corroborating evidence for alternative hypotheses suggesting that the WTC towers were brought down by controlled demolition using explosives planted prior to September 11, 2001"[26] and posted a FAQ about related issues to its website in August 2006.[18] The major elements of the theory have been rebutted in mainstream engineering scholarship,[15] where its proponents are considered "outsiders".[5]
A 2006 poll found that 6 percent of Americans considered it "very likely" that "the collapse of the twin towers in New York was aided by explosives secretly planted in the two buildings", while another 10% found it "somewhat likely". 77% found the demolition theory "unlikely".[27] A 2007 poll found that 67% of Americans fault the 9/11 Commission for not investigating the collapse of World Trade Center 7.[28] An August 2007 Zogby poll found that 4.8% of Americans believe that "certain US government elements actively planned or assisted some aspects of the attacks".[29]

World Trade Center Seven

The position of Building 7 in relation to the other WTC buildings. WTC 1, 2, and 7 collapsed on September 11, 2001.


7 World Trade Center was a 47-story skyscraper that stood across Vesey Street north of the main WTC complex. Though not hit by a plane, it was damaged by fires which burned for seven hours, until it collapsed about 5:20 p.m. EDT on the evening of September 11.
No steel-frame high rise had ever before collapsed because of a fire.[30] BBC News reported the collapse of WTC 7 twenty minutes before it actually fell. The BBC has stated that many news sources were reporting the imminent collapse of WTC 7 on the day of the attacks.[31] Jane Staley, the reporter who announced the collapse prematurely, called it a "very small and very honest mistake" caused by her thinking on her feet after being confronted with a report she had no way of checking.[32]
Steven Jones says the debris contains thermate, suggesting explosives might have been used to destroy the building.[33][34] Richard Sisson says the sulfur came from gypsum in the wallboards,[35] an opinion which was also given in the NIST report.[36]




WTC 7 at the moment of collapse: the shape of the roof and debris plumes are cited as evidence for controlled demolition.


In the PBS documentary America Rebuilds, which aired in September 2002, Larry Silverstein, the owner of WTC 7 and leaseholder and insurance policy holder for the remainder of the WTC Complex, recalled a discussion with the fire department in which doubts about containing the fires were expressed. Silverstein recalled saying, "We've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it". "They made that decision to pull", he recalled, "and we watched the building collapse." Silverstein issued a statement that it was the firefighting team, not the building, that was to be pulled.[37]
In 2002 the National Institute of Standards and Technology began a general investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center but soon made a decision to focus first on the collapse of the Twin Towers.[36] A draft version of its final report on the collapse of building 7 was released in August 2008. The agency has blamed the slowness of this investigation on the complexity of the computer model it is using, which simulates the collapse from the moment it begins all the way to the ground, and notes that the time taken on the investigation into building 7 is comparable to the time taken to investigate an aircraft crash.[36] The agency also notes another 80 boxes of documents related to WTC7 were found and had to be analyzed. These delays fueled suspicion the agency was struggling to come up with a plausible conclusion.[38]
Preliminary investigations did not include the mechanics of the actual collapse, concentrating instead on the events leading up to it. However, the final draft report on the collapse of WTC7 by NIST provides a detailed investigation into the collapse timeline, starting with the failure of a critical column, Column 79 (initial failure event). 6 seconds later, the collapse of the East Penthouse on the roof was visible. The collapse of the core columns progressed from east to west for another 6.9 seconds (12.9 seconds total since the initial failure event). At this point, the report says, "all the interior columns had buckled" and "the remaining exterior structure above began to fall vertically as a single unit." To calculate the timeline of the collapse of the rest of the building, NIST focused on the time between the initial collapse of the roofline and the last position that the complete roofline could be observed before portions of it started to become obscured by dust, at the top of Floor 29. NIST calculated the timeline for this observable descent as 5.4 seconds and calculated the theoretical free-fall time for the same portion of the building as 3.9 seconds, and concluded that, "The actual collapse time of the upper 18 floors of the north face of WTC7 (the floors clearly visible in the video evidence) was 40 percent greater than the computed free fall time. This was consistent with physical principles."[39]
Following a three year investigation NIST released its final report on the collapse on November 20, 2008.[40] Investigators used videos, photographs and building design documents to come to their conclusions. The report concluded that the building collapsed due to the effects of the fires which burned for almost seven hours. The fatal blow to the building came when the 13th floor collapsed, weakening a critical steel support column that led to catastrophic failure, and extreme heat caused some steel beams to lose strength, causing further failures throughout the buildings until the entire structure succumbed. Also cited as a factor was the collapse of the nearby towers, which broke the city water main, leaving the sprinkler system in the bottom half of the building without water.
NIST considered the possibility that the towers were brought down with explosives and concluded that a blast event did not occur.[citation needed] The investigation noted that no blast was audible on recordings of the collapse and that no blast was reported by witnesses, even though it would have been audible at a level of at least 130-140 decibels at a distance of half a mile. NIST also investigated the possibility that the collapse was caused by thermite and concluded that it is unlikely that the quantities needed could have been carried into the building undetected. The theory that fires from the large amount of diesel fuel stored in the building caused the collapse was also investigated and ruled out.[36]
World Trade Center developer Larry Silverstein said, "Hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9/11 conspiracy theories, which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day." Richard Gage, leader of the group Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth said, "How much longer do we have to endure the coverup of how Building 7 was destroyed?". [41] James Quintiere, professor of fire protection engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, who does not believe explosives brought down the towers, questioned how the agency came to its conclusions, remarking, "They don't have the expertise on explosives." Quintiere said NIST wasted time employing outside experts to consider it.[42]

Main towers
Steven Jones has claimed that anecdotal evidence[15] of molten steel found in the rubble of the collapse[43] and a stream of molten metal that poured out of WTC2 before it collapsed[44] are evidence of temperatures beyond those produced by the fire (which was not expected to be hot enough to melt steel). Jones has argued that the molten metal may have been iron, a byproduct of a thermite reaction. NIST found that the condition of the steel in the wreckage of the towers does not provide conclusive information on the condition of the building before the collapse and concluded that the material coming from WTC2 was molten aluminum from the plane, which would have melted at lower temperatures than steel. They also pointed out that cutting through the vertical columns would require planting an enormous amount of explosives inconspicuously in highly secured buildings, then igniting it remotely while keeping it in contact with the columns.[18]
The NIST report provides an analysis of the structural response of the building only up to the point where collapse begins, and asserts that the enormous kinetic energy transferred by the falling part of the building makes "progressive collapse" inevitable once an initial collapse occurs. A paper by Zdeněk Bažant indicates that once collapse began, the kinetic energy imparted by a falling upper section onto the floor below was at least ten times greater than that which the lower section could support.[5]
Engineers who have investigated the collapses generally deny that controlled demolition is required to understand the structural response of the buildings. While the top of one of the towers did tilt significantly, it could not ultimately have fallen into the street, they argue, because any such tilting would place sufficient stress on the lower story (acting as a pivot) that it would collapse long before the top had sufficiently shifted its center of gravity. Indeed, they argue, there is very little difference between progressive collapse with or without explosives in terms of the resistance that the structures could provide after collapse began.[5][45] Controlled demolition of a building requires weeks of preparation, including laying large quantities of explosive and cutting through beams, which would have rendered the building highly dangerous and which would have to be done without attracting the attention of the thousands of people who worked in the building.[43][46] Controlled demolition takes place at the bottom of buildings and it is clear that the collapse started high up at the point where the aircraft struck. Furthermore any explosives would have to withstand the impact of the airliners.[43]
Proponents claim that eyewitness accounts made by firefighters and emergency medical responders of explosions just prior to the start of the collapse of the towers are suggestive of controlled demolition.[47] However there are many causes of loud sharp noises that are not caused by explosives,[48] and seismographic records of the collapse do not show evidence of explosions.[49]
Additionally, the production and expansion of the enormous dust clouds that covered Manhattan after the collapses has also been taken as an indication of an additional source of energy, such as explosives. NIST attributes these clouds to the ejection of air from compressed parts of the building.[50]

Debris removal
Some of the steel from the Twin Towers was removed and sent to scrap yards before engineers were allowed access to the site on October 6, 2001. Webster Griffin Tarpley, an author, has criticized the official response to the crime scene, saying that the cleanup process resulted in the destruction of most of the evidence, identifying the New York City Mayor's office as a key player in this regard.[51]
The debris removal process began shortly after the attacks, and concluded in May 2002.[52] Robert F. Shea of FEMA testified to the House of Representatives that, "Because of the importance of the rescue effort at the World Trade Center complex, it was clear that information would have to be gathered without interfering with response and rescue activities. Based on this fact, the FEMA-ASCE team first visited the site on October 6, [2001] but gathered information from others who had been on-site before this date."[53]
A call to action by Bill Manning, the chief editor of the trade journal Fire Engineering, is often quoted in this connection. In a January 2002 editorial, Manning called the early ASCE investigation (which would later turn into the FEMA building performance study) a "half-baked farce" and said that "the destruction and removal of evidence must stop immediately." He said that the cleanup of the WTC site differed in many respects from that of other engineering disasters.[54] In defense of the decision to dispose of the steel, Mayor Bloomberg said: "If you want to take a look at the construction methods and the design, that's in this day and age what computers do."[55] David Ray Griffin notes that this is exactly what Manning had worried about when he warned that "the investigation into the World Trade Center fire and collapse will amount to paper-and computer-generated hypotheticals.
However, allegations against a "speedy removal" of the steel hampering the engineering investigations appear to be unfounded, according to Dr. Gene Corley, head of the BPAT team and one of the lead engineers for the investigation by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which began in September 2002. He testified to the House of Representatives in March 2002 that, "There has been some concern expressed by others that the work of the team has been hampered because debris was removed from the site and has subsequently been processed for recycling. This is not the case. The team has had full access to the scrap yards and to the site and has been able to obtain numerous samples. At this point there is no indication that having access to each piece of steel from the World Trade Center would make a significant difference to understanding the performance of the structures".[53]

Notable proponents
The most notable statements of the controlled demolition conspiracy theory have been made by Steven Jones, David Ray Griffin, Webster Griffin Tarpley and Kevin Ryan. Jones has published his paper "Why Indeed Did the World Trade Center Buildings Collapse?"[2] in a book called 9/11 and the American Empire: Intellectuals Speak Out, edited by Peter Dale Scott and David Ray Griffin.[56] Griffin, a retired professor of theology, published his own version of the theory in The Hidden History of 9-11-2001,[57] a book of critical essays on 9/11 edited by Paul Zarembka. Webster Griffin Tarpley has devoted a chapter of his book 9/11 Synthetic Terror[51] to the theory.

Criticism of the NIST Report
Criticism of the NIST Report plays a prominent role in presentations of the theory. Critics point out that the report does not provide an account of the structural behaviour of the towers after the collapses began.[58] This is important because "much of the external evidence for controlled demolition typically comes after collapse initiation".[59] It is argued that not modelling the totality of the collapses allowed NIST to ignore evidence of demolition, such as the complete, rapid and symmetrical nature of the collapses, the observed explosive "squibs", the early drop of the North Tower antenna, and the pools of molten metal found in the rubble.[60] Kevin Ryan's criticism of the NIST investigation and subsequent report is often mentioned in this regard.[61] Jones also criticises NIST for "tweaking" the computer simulations of the pre-collapse sequence "until [it got] the desired result.”[62] Jones goes on to quote the NIST report itself as proof for this claim, "The Investigation Team then defined three cases for each building by combining the middle, less severe, and more severe values of the influential variables. Upon a preliminary examination of the middle cases,it became clear that the towers would likely remain standing...The more severe case was used for the global analysis of each tower..To the extent that the simulations deviated from the photographic evidence or eyewitness reports."[63]
Members of the 9/11 Truth movement have filed Requests for Correction to the NIST report.[64] Only one of their requests resulted in a change[65][66] to correct an inconsistency between two parts of the NIST report.[65] An unsuccessful appeal was then filed.[67][68]

Reaction of the engineering community
The controlled demolition theory has been dismissed in the structural engineering literature.[5][69] Northwestern University Professor of Civil Engineering Zdeněk Bažant, who was the first to offer a published peer reviewed theory of the collapses, mentions the controlled demolition theory in passing in a 2007 paper, co-authored with Mathieu Verdure. Affirming the view as presented in the NIST report, they note "a few outsiders claiming a conspiracy with planted explosives" as an exception. Bažant and Verdure trace such "strange ideas" to a "mistaken impression" that safety margins in design would make the collapses impossible. One of the effects of a more detailed modeling of the progressive collapse, they say, could be to "dispel the myth of planted explosives". Indeed, Bažant and Verdure have proposed examining data from controlled demolitions in order to better model the progressive-collapse of the towers, suggesting that progressive collapse and controlled demolition are not two separate modes of failure (as the controlled demolition conspiracy theory assumes).[5]
Thomas Eagar, a professor of materials science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also dismissed the controlled demolition conspiracy theory.[44] Eagar remarked, "These people (in the 9/11 truth movement) use the 'reverse scientific method.' They determine what happened, throw out all the data that doesn't fit their conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion."[70] Finally, Leslie Robertson, who helped design the Twin Towers, debated the issue with Steven Jones on a radio program in December 2006.[71][72]

In popular culture
The demolition theory first entered mainstream media by way of negative press coverage of "9/11 conspiracy theories" or "9/11 myths". Critical articles in Popular Mechanics, which were later expanded into a book, and the popular magazine Skeptic[73] presented rebuttals to the theory for a mainstream audience. In 2006, New York Magazine reported, "A new generation of conspiracy theorists is at work on a secret history of New York’s most terrible day."[74] The theory has been cited by popular actors, musicians and politicians, including Charlie Sheen,[75][76] Willie Nelson,[77] and former Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura.[78] The theory also features prominently in Zeitgeist, the Movie and Loose Change.

Eagar is one scientist who has paid some attention to the demolition hypothesis — albeit grudgingly. A materials engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Eagar wrote one of the early papers on the buildings' collapses, which later became the basis for a documentary on PBS. That marked him for scrutiny and attack from conspiracy theorists. For a time, he says, he was receiving one or two angry e-mail messages each week, many accusing him of being a government shill. When Mr. Jones's paper came out, the nasty messages increased to one or two per day."
