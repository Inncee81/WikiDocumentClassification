From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Data Transfer Object (DTO), formerly known as Value Objects or VO, is a design pattern used to transfer data between software application subsystems. DTOs are often used in conjunction with Data Access Objects to retrieve data from a database.
The difference between Data Transfer Objects and Business Objects or Data Access Objects is that a DTO does not have any behaviour except for storage and retrieval of its own data (accessors and mutators).
The Value Object pattern in Domain-driven design is not the same as the DTO pattern.
