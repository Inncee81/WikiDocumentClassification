SMS gateway is the term used to describe a service transforming messages to mobile network traffic from other media, or vice versa, allowing transmission or receipt of SMS messages without the use of a mobile phone. Typical use of a gateway would be to forward simple e-mail to a mobile phone recipient.

[edit] Technical

Some SMS gateway providers can be classified as aggregators or SS7 providers. The aggregator model is based on multiple agreements with mobile carriers to exchange 2-way SMS traffic into and out of the operator’s Short Message Service Centre (SMS-C), also known as 'local termination model'[citation needed]. Aggregators lack direct access into the SS7 protocol, which is the protocol where the SMS messages are exchanged. These providers have no visibility and control over the message delivery, being unable to offer delivery guarantees. SMS messages are delivered in the operator’s SMS-C, but not the subscriber’s handset.
Another type of SMS gateway provider is based on SS7 connectivity to route SMS messages, also known as 'international termination model'[citation needed]. The advantage of this model is the ability to route data directly through SS7, which gives the provider total control and visibility of the complete path during the SMS routing. This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the SMS-C of other mobile operators. Therefore, it’s possible to avoid delays and message losses, offering full delivery guarantees of messages and optimized routing.

[edit] Quality of service
The University of Duisburg-Essen, in partnership with mobile messaging provider Tyntec, have developed the study for SMS messaging to enable the detailed monitoring of SMS transmissions to ensure a greater degree of reliability and a higher average speed of delivery.[1] The new parameters can be used by mobile network operators, third party SMS gateways and mobile network infrastructure software vendors to monitor the transmission of SMS messages and to detect network transmission problems quickly and accurately. Based on this study, Tyntec developed relevant Service Level Agreement (SLA) to support the delivery of high quality messaging applications to enterprises, banks and financial institutions and various industry sectors.

Several operators have true fixed-wire SMS services. These are based on extensions to the ETSI GSM SMS standards and allow fixed-fixed, fixed-mobile and mobile-fixed messaging. These use Frequency-shift keying to transfer the message between the terminal and the SMSC. Terminals are usually DECT-based, but wired handsets and wired text-only (no voice) devices exist. Messages are received by the terminal recognising that the CLI is that of the SMSC and going off-hook silently to receive the message.

[edit] Computer to SMS gateways
Various mechanisms are used to provide a way to send SMS messages from a desktop computer. In most cases, these either provide a transfer and billing mechanism to interface with a mobile phone carrier, possibly via one or many third parties, or directly control a mobile phone or other GSM device.

[edit] SMS gateway appliances
A gateway appliance such as Red Oxygen's Base Camp, SOPRANO Corporate Gateway Platform for SMS (Appliance), Felltech's OutboxSMS, or OZEKI NG SMS gateway, [4]is a term used to describe a local device (customer premises equipment) which communicates (via secure/unsecure internet or dedicated connections) with one or many mobile network operator SMSCs or with an aggregator gateway[citation needed] that itself connects to many mobile network operator SMSCs. Read more: [5].

[edit] IP gateways
For high volume SMS(text) traffic IP SMS gateways can be used. These gateways connect directly to the Short Message Service Center (SMSC) of the SMS service providers using one of the following protocols: SMPP, UCP/EMI, CIMD2. Most IP SMS gateways provide various API's that allow software developers to send and receive large number of messages[citation needed].

[edit] Home automation systems
Some Home Automation systems have the ability to accept SMS messages from the users' mobile phones to control lighting and other appliances[citation needed]. The system may send an SMS confirmation when the requested action has been performed or send alerts via SMS[citation needed]. These systems would require a connected mobile phone or access to a gateway.

[edit] Software to control mobile phones with a computer
Some products exist which allow messages to be sent via pre-installed software (via a PC or laptop) and an attached GSM device. The OZEKI message server and OZEKING are the examples of this solution. This plug-and-play software was recently used to great effect as a monitoring tool during the Nigerian elections,[2] and also won the WSIS "ICT Success Story of the Month" for April 2007.[3]

[edit] Skype to SMS
The Skype client (from V2.5 onwards) provides Skype SMS access. Skype users can send SMS messages to cellphones/mobiles (and land-line phones, where available) which are debited to their SkypeOut account. The Skype client logs a receipt confirming that the SMS has been received.[4]

[edit] SMS to Skype
SMS to Skype allows a GSM mobile phone user to send Skype chat messages from their phone.

[edit] Microsoft Outlook to SMS
Microsoft Outlook 2007 has native support for sending SMS messages via the Outlook Mobile Service. There are also plug-ins for Microsoft Outlook such as Outlook SMS that add this functionality.

However many carriers will relay the message properly if an email address is entered as the SMS recipient.

See List of carriers providing Email or Web to SMS
Some mobile phone carriers provide a mechanism to send emails to mobile phones using SMS. An existing alternative is sending a SMS using a web based application (ie. from a website).
