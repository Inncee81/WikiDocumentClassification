[edit] Single-user application of multi-user wikis
Most community wikis are designed for concurrent use by multiple users. However, most of these are installable for standalone use as well. This may require installing additional software, for example a web server, a database management system, or a WAMP/LAMP software bundle. Nevertheless, this does not mean the wiki must be accessible to outside users.
Some individuals use password protected wikis running either on their own webservers or hosted by third parties. This has the advantage that the personal space can be accessed from any web browser, at home, at work, on a PDA, at an internet cafe etc. Edits made on one machine are immediately accessible on the others.

[edit] Multi-user wikis with personal editions

MoinMoin has MoinMoin Desktop Edition - It is written in Python. It is for Windows, Linux and Mac users.
TWiki has TWiki for Windows Personal and Certified TWiki - Written in Perl. Both support Windows users.
ScrewTurn Wiki Desktop Edition [1] is written in C# for Windows users.
DokuWiki has Dokuwiki on a Stick - It works on plain text files and thus needs no database. Its syntax is similar to the one used by MediaWiki and makes sure the data files remain readable outside the wiki. It's written in PHP and is multi-platform.


[edit] Wikis designed for personal use

There are also wikis specifically designed for personal use. Their feature set often differs from traditional wikis; examples are:

Dynamic tree views of the wiki (These are useful because wikis built for personal usage are often small.)
Drag and drop support for images, text and video, mathematics
Use of OLE or Linkback to allow wikis to act as relational superstructures for multiple desktop type documents
Multimedia embedding, in particular wikis one can link to internal aspects of movies and sound tracks and store notes / comments
Macros and macros constructors. Also often support for alien macros so the wiki can act as a multi scripting macro system
