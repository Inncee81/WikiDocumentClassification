GNUstep is a free software implementation of NeXT's OpenStep Objective-C libraries (called frameworks), widget toolkit, and application development tools not only for Unix-like operating systems, but also for Microsoft Windows. It is part of the GNU Project.
GNUstep features a cross-platform, object-oriented development environment based on and completely compatible with the OpenStep specification developed by NeXT (which has since been bought by Apple Inc.) and Sun Microsystems. Like Apple, GNUstep also has a Java interface to OpenStep, as well as Ruby [1] and Scheme [2] bindings. The GNUstep developers track some additions to Apple's Cocoa to remain compatible. The roots of the GNUstep application interface are the same as the roots of Cocoa: NeXT and OpenStep. GNUstep predates Cocoa.

[edit] History
GNUstep began when Paul Kunz and others at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center wanted to port HippoDraw from NEXTSTEP to another platform. Instead of rewriting HippoDraw from scratch and reusing only the application design, they decided to rewrite the NeXTSTEP object layer on which the application depended. This was the first version of libobjcX. It enabled them to port HippoDraw to Unix systems running the X Window System without changing a single line of their application source. After the OpenStep specification was released to the public in 1994, they decided to write a new objcX which would adhere to the new APIs. The software would become known as "GNUstep".

[edit] Paradigms
GNUstep is modeled somewhat on OPENSTEP, NeXT's implementation of the OpenStep API, and thus inherits some design principles proposed in OPENSTEP as well as the Objective-C language.

Model-view-controller paradigm
Target-Action
Drag and drop
Delegation
Message forwarding (through NSInvocation)


[edit] Applications
Here are some examples of applications written for or ported to GNUstep.

[edit] Written from Scratch

GNUMail, an e-mail client, which can also run on Mac OS X.
GNUstepWeb, an application server
GNUstep Database Library 2, an EOF (Enterprise Objects Framework) clone
Gorm, the Interface Builder
ProjectCenter, the Project Builder or Xcode equivalent.
GWorkspace
TalkSoup
Zipper
Terminal
Grr, an RSS feed reader.


[edit] Ported from NeXTSTEP, OPENSTEP, or Mac OS X

TimeMon
TextEdit
Chess (application)
Bean
Cenon
EdenMath
Emacs
Gomoku
NeXTGO
BioCocoa
Adun
Fortunate


[edit] Class capabilities

[edit] Foundation Kit

collections (arrays, sets, dictionaries) and enumerators
file management
object archiving
advanced date manipulation
distributed objects and inter-process communication
URL handling
notifications (and distributed notifications)
easy multi-threading
timers
locks
exception handling


[edit] Application Kit

user interface elements (table views, browsers, matrices, scroll views)
graphics (WYSIWYG, postscript-like graphics, bezier paths, image handling with multiple representations, graphical contexts)
color management (calibrated vs. device colors; CMYK, RGB, HSB, gray and named color representations; alpha transparency)
text system features: rich text format, text attachments, layout manager, typesetter, rules, paragraph styles, font management, spelling
document management

[edit] GNUSTEP live CD
The GNUSTEP live CD is based on Debian and works on i486, AMD64, PowerPC, and UltraSPARC computers. It is currently created using debian-live. Installing the system to a harddisk is possible with Internet access and the debootstrap tool.
