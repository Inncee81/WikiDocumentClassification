[edit] Open source software
The development of open source GIS software has - in terms of software history - a long tradition[2] with the appearance of a first system in 1978. Numerous systems are nowadays available which cover all sectors of geospatial data handling.

[edit] Desktop GIS
The following open source desktop GIS projects are reviewed in Steiniger and Bocher (2008/9)[3]:




gvSIG 1.0






GRASS GIS 6.4



GRASS GIS – Originally developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, open source: a complete GIS
SAGA GIS – System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses- a hybrid GIS software. SAGA has a unique Application Programming Interface (API) and a fast growing set of geoscientifc methods, bundled in exchangeable Module Libraries.
Quantum GIS – QGIS is a user friendly Open Source GIS that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and Windows.
MapWindow GIS – Free, open source GIS desktop application and programming component.
ILWIS – ILWIS (Integrated Land and Water Information System) integrates image, vector and thematic data.
uDig
gvSIG – Open source GIS written in Java.
JUMP GIS / OpenJUMP – (Open) Java Unified Mapping Platform (the desktop GIS OpenJUMP, SkyJUMP, deeJUMP and Kosmo emerged from JUMP; see [3])

other:




Capaware rc1 0.1






SAGA-GIS v. 2.0.3



Kalypso (software) – Kalypso is an Open Source GIS (Java, GML3) and focuses mainly on numerical simulations in water management.
TerraView – GIS desktop that handles vector and raster data stored in a relational or geo-relational database, i.e. a frontend for TerraLib.
Capaware – Capaware is also an Open Source GIS, an incredible fast C++ 3D GIS Framework with a multiple plugin architecture for geographic graphical analysis and visualisation.


[edit] Other GIS tools - classified
Note, for different categories of GIS tools see GIS software and [1].
WebMap Server

GeoServer
MapGuide Open Source – Web-based mapping server.
MapServer – Web-based mapping server, developed by the University of Minnesota.

Spatial Database Management Systems

PostGIS – Spatial extensions for the open source PostgreSQL database, allowing geospatial queries.
H2Spatial for H2_(DBMS)
SpatialLite for SQLite
MySQL Spatial
TerraLib is more than a spatial DBMS as it provides also advanced functions for GIS analysis.

Software Development Frameworks and Libraries (non-web)

GeoTools – Open source GIS toolkit written in Java, using Open Geospatial Consortium specifications.
GDAL / OGR
Proj.4
OpenMap

Software Development Frameworks and Libraries (for web applications)

MapFish A web 2.0 mapping development framework.
OpenLayers – open source AJAX library for accessing geographic data layers of all kinds, originally developed and sponsored by MetaCarta
Geomajas – Open source web toolkit with full vectorial and attribute editing capabilities and support for complex relation models (1 to n, n to 1, inheritance, ...). Built on top of the Dojo AJAX framework.
GeoDjango a set of extensions to Django, an open source web content framework, allowing for easy portrayal of geospatial data inside a web portal

Cataloging application for spatially referenced resources

GeoNetwork opensource – A catalog application to manage spatially referenced resources


[edit] Other GIS tools - unclassified

FIST – FIST (Flexible Internet Spatial Template) is a MapServer/PHP framework with several advanced functions, optionally use PostGIS in the backend so your users can edit and save shapes and attributes.
Chameleon – Environments for building applications with MapServer.
MapPoint, a technology ("MapPoint Web Service," previously known as MapPoint .NET) and a specific software program created by Microsoft that allows users to view, edit and integrate maps.
OpenMap
Xastir A special purpose Open Source GIS application used as an APRS client by Amateur radio operators, written in C for X Window environments.
Gisgraphy Gisgraphy is a free and open source framework that provides full-text and find nearby places search services, for places on earth from several databases (geonames, openstreet map)
