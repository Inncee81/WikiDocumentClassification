From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The smoke point refers to the temperature at which a cooking fat or oil begins to break down. The substance smokes or burns, and gives food an unpleasant taste. Therefore, the smoke point of a given fat is a key consideration in frying, with the smoke point of the oil dictating what temperatures and therefore what purposes a particular fat may be used for (for instance, deep frying is a very high-temperature process and requires a fat with a high smoke point). Beyond the smoke point is the flash point, the point at which combustion occurs.
