7-Zip is an open source file archiver designed originally for Microsoft Windows. 7-Zip operates primarily with the 7z archive format, as well as being able to read and write to several other archive formats. A user can use the command line interface, graphical user interface, or Windows shell integration. 7-Zip began in 2000 and is actively developed by Igor Pavlov. It is related to a cross-platform port, p7zip.
Unlike WinZip and WinRAR programs, which are distributed under proprietary licenses, 7-Zip is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. 7-Zip was the winner of the SourceForge.net 2007 community choice awards for "Technical Design" and for "Best Project".[2]

[edit] Formats

[edit] The 7z archive format
Main article: 7z
By default, 7-Zip creates 7z format archives, with a .7z file extension. Each archive can contain multiple directories and files. As a container format, security or size reduction are achieved using a stacked combination of filters. These can consist of pre-processors, compression algorithms, and encryption filters.
The core .7z compression uses a variety of algorithms, the most common of which are bzip2 and LZMA. Developed by Igor Pavlov, LZMA is a relatively new system, making its debut as part of the 7z format. LZMA consists of a large LZ-based sliding dictionary up to 4 GiB in size, backed by a range coder.
LZMA compression ratios tend to be very efficient. Compressed sizes are comparable to other high-gain compression formats, including RAR or ACE, both of which are proprietary.
The native 7z file format is open and modular. All filenames are stored as Unicode.

[edit] Other supported formats
7-Zip supports a number of other compression, and non-compression, archive formats. Supported formats include:
Packing/Unpacking of ZIP, gzip, bzip2, tar
Unpacking only: Microsoft cabinet (CAB) files, RAR, ARJ, Z, LHA, cpio, smzip, JAR, ISO CD/DVD images (7Zip version 4.42 and up), rpm and Debian deb archives.
7-Zip is able to open some MSI files, allowing access to the meta-files within along with the main contents. Some Microsoft CAB (LZX compression) and NSIS (LZMA) installer formats can be opened, making 7-Zip a good tool to check if a given binary file is in fact an archive.
When compressing ZIP or gzip files, 7-Zip uses a home-brewed DEFLATE encoder which is often able to achieve higher compression levels than the more common DEFLATE implementation of zlib, at the expense of compression speed. The 7-Zip deflate encoder implementation is available separately as part of the AdvanceCOMP suite of tools.

[edit] Variations
In the form of p7zip, the command line version has been ported for use on Unix-like systems including Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. There are several GUI frontends for p7zip such as Q7Z. An alternate GUI for 7-Zip on Windows, #7Z, has been released by the same developers.[3]
Two command line versions are provided: 7z.exe, using external libraries; and a stand-alone executable 7za.exe containing built-in modules. However, 7za's compression/decompression support is limited to 7z, ZIP, gzip, bzip2, Z and tar formats. A 64-bit version is available for 64-bit editions of Windows, with support for large memory maps leading to faster compression. All versions support multi-threading.
A freeware application based on the 7-Zip engine, jZip, is available for Microsoft Windows. Its stated focus is an easier, more streamlined user interface than 7-Zip.

[edit] Features
7-Zip supports many features, some which may not be found in popular commercial compression software.

For encryption, 7z archives support the 256-bit AES cipher. Encryption can be enabled for both files and the 7z directory structure. When the directory structure is encrypted, users are required to supply a password to see the filenames contained within the archive, unless only the data was encrypted but not the filenames. WinZip-developed AES encryption standard is also available in 7-Zip to encrypt ZIP archives with AES 256-bit, but it doesn't offer filename encryption like in 7z archives.[4]
7-Zip flexibly supports volumes of dynamically variable sizes, useful for backups on removable media such as writable CDs and DVDs.
When in 2-panel mode, 7-Zip can be considered a basic orthodox file manager.
Multiple CPU / core / threading settings can be configured.
Ability to attempt to open EXE files as archives. (Useful for decompressing data from inside many "SetUp" or "Installer" or "Extract" type programs without having to launch them)
Ability to browse and extract data from ISO data images/archives.
7-Zip has the ability to unpack archives with corrupted filenames, renaming the files as required.
7-Zip has the ability to create self-extracting archives although cannot do so for multi-volume archives.
