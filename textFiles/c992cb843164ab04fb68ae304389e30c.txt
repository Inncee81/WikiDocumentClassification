From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The Oz books form a book series that begins with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and that relates the "history" of the Land of Oz. Oz was originally created by author L. Frank Baum, who went on to write fourteen Oz books. Although most of the Oz books are strictly adventures, Baum—as well as many later Oz authors—styled themselves as "Royal Historians" of Oz to emphasize that Oz is a genuine place. Later authors wrote 26 other "official" books after Baum's death. Many other authors have put their own twists on Oz, notably Gregory Maguire's revisionist Wicked. For more such books, please see List of published Oz Apocrypha.

[edit] Background
The first fourteen books by the original author, L. Frank Baum, another nineteen by Ruth Plumly Thompson, and another seven books by various other authors comprise the "Famous Forty", which is considered the classic original series by The International Wizard of Oz Club (though many inconsistencies make it difficult to call it canonical). Most of the books in the "Famous Forty" were published by Reilly & Britton (later Reilly & Lee).

1909
Reilly & Britton

John R. Neill
1914
Reilly & Britton


Betsy Bobbin, a girl from Oklahoma, is shipwrecked with her mule, Hank, in the Rose Kingdom. She meets the Shaggy Man there and the two try to rescue the Shaggy Man's brother from the Nome King. This book is partly based upon Baum's stage musical, The Tik-Tok Man of Oz, which was in turn based on Ozma of Oz.



9
The Scarecrow of Oz
John R. Neill
1915
Reilly & Britton


Cap'n Bill and Trot journey to Oz and, with the help of the Scarecrow, overthrow the cruel King Krewl of Jinxland. Cap'n Bill and Trot had previously appeared in two other novels by Baum, The Sea Fairies and Sky Island. Based in part upon the 1914 silent film, His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz.



10
Rinkitink in Oz
John R. Neill
1916
Reilly & Britton


Prince Inga of Pingaree and King Rinkitink and their companions have adventures that lead to the land of the Nomes and, eventually, Oz. This book only ends up in Oz at the end, because Baum originally wrote it as a non-Oz book, entitled King Rinkitink, and only rewrote it later.



11
The Lost Princess of Oz
John R. Neill
1917
Reilly & Britton


Concerning the disappearance of Princess Ozma, the ruler of Oz. When she is discovered missing, four search parties are sent out, one for each of Oz's four countries. Most of the book covers Dorothy and the Wizard's efforts to find her. Meanwhile, Cayke the Cookie Cook discovers that her magic dishpan (on which she bakes her famous cookies) has been stolen. Along with the Frogman, they leave their mountain in the Winkie Country to find the pan.



12

13
The Magic of Oz
John R. Neill
1919
Reilly & Lee


Ruggedo, former Nome King, tries to conquer Oz again with the help of a Munchkin boy, Kiki Aru. In the meanwhile, it is also Ozma's birthday, and all of Oz's citizens are searching for the most unusual present for the little princess. This was published a month after Baum's death.



14
Glinda of Oz
John R. Neill
1920
Reilly & Lee


Dorothy, Ozma and Glinda try to stop a war in the Gillikin Country. This was Baum's last Oz book, and was published posthumously. Most critics agree this is Baum's darkest Oz book, most likely due to his failing health.



[edit] By Ruth Plumly Thompson
Thompson's style was markedly different from Baum's. Her tales harkened back to more traditional fairytales. She often included a small kingdom, with a prince or princess who saves his or her kingdom and regains the throne or saves Oz from invasion. Thompson even respelled Baum's respelling "Nome" as the more traditional "Gnome". All in all Thompson wrote 19 Oz books, five more than Baum.

The phrase "The Wizard of Oz" was included in the title to coincide with the 1939 release of the film The Wizard of Oz.



[edit] By other writers
When Thompson retired in 1939 longtime Oz illustrator John R. Neill took over the series and wrote three more of the "Famous Forty". Neill's vision of Oz is more manic than Thompson or Baum's. Houses often get up and do battle, and everything can be alive. His entries take Oz's color scheme (blue for Munchkin Country, red for Quadling Country, etc.) to an extreme, extending it to sky and skin colors.
Jack Snow was a Baum scholar, and even offered to take over the series at age twelve when Baum died. Snow's books lack any characters created by Thompson or Neill, although he did create his own.

[edit] Non-canonical Oz works by "Royal Historians"
Each of the "Royal Historians" wrote Oz-related works not generally considered canonical, while some are considered deutero-canonical. Some are short stories, some are reference works, still others are novels written sometimes years after the authors' main body of Oz books. Baum's other Oz books are somewhat more contradictory of his canon books than the canon books are to each other, while Yankee through Wicked Witch are often referred to in fan circles as the "Quasi-Famous 7." The books of Sherwood Smith are officially recognized as canon by The Baum Trust, but as they deal with a new generation of characters, not all fans agree.

Definitive guide to the Oz characters.


Baum also wrote Oz-related stage plays: The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1901) with music by Paul Tietjens and Nathaniel D. Mann, The Wizard of Oz (1902) (music by Tietjens et al.; with jokes by Glen MacDonough), The Woggle-Bug (1905) with music by Frederick Chapin, The Rainbow's Daughter, or The Magnet of Love (February 1909) with music by Manuel Klein, revised in April 1909 as Ozma of Oz, and ultimately produced, with music by Louis F. Gottschalk as The Tik-Tok Man of Oz. Also in 1909, he wrote a play called The Girl from Oz. The manuscript is held in the archives at Syracuse University, but apparently its relation to Oz is little more than nominal (it is also known as The Girl from Tomorrow and was later adapted for radio by Frank Joslyn Baum), as is also the case with the short story, "The Littlest Giant", a rather brutal tale designated in two lines to be in the Gillikin country of Oz. With Gottschalk writing the music, he wrote an unproduced stage version of The Patchwork Girl of Oz in November 1913, that was developed into the film scenario.
Jack Snow also wrote a short story titled "A Murder in Oz," in which Tip takes his life back from Ozma, and both are ultimately restored as twin siblings. Few fans regard this story as canon, and the largest Oz-devoted vanity press has released a trilogy of books that seem to completely contradict it, though its author reports working on something that resolves that.
Ruth Plumly Thompson also wrote a great deal of poetry about the Oz characters, which the International Wizard of Oz Club posthumously published as The Cheerful Citizens of Oz.

[edit] Later sequels
The following are some of the most significant additions to the Oz series by later authors. They are generally considered apocrypha, but are more or less in line with the originals.
See also List of published Oz Apocrypha for a much longer list, including small press items available mostly through mail order.

Below are some books which deal with alternate views of Oz, and are usually considered apocryphal. Because there are literally hundreds of unofficial Oz books, the following is a list of those that are best-known, or most independently or commercially successful.

Notes


The Laughing Dragon of Oz
Frank Joslyn Baum
1934
Was a "Big little book" written by Baum's son (credited as "Frank Baum") and published by Whitman Publishing. It had none of the characters from the official Oz books, though briefly mentioned the Wizard. Whitman quickly withdrew it after a lawsuit threat from Reilly & Lee.


A Barnstormer in Oz
Philip José Farmer
1982
Set approximately 30 years after the events of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the protagonist of this novel is Hank Stover, the son of Dorothy Gale Stover. After his plane is lost in a mysterious green cloud, Hank finds himself in an Oz on the brink of a civil war. The novel states that the events of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz are based on real events. Baum had been a newspaper reporter in Nebraska around the time Dorothy was transported to Oz; he interviewed her and later used his notes as the basis for the first novel. All subsequent novels by Baum are solely products of his imagination.


Was
Geoff Ryman
1992
Was employs the literary conceit that a Kansas girl named Dorothy existed and that, as a school teacher, L. Frank Baum made up the story of the first Oz book in order to amuse her. The novel takes place in the real world.


Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West
Gregory Maguire
1995
Published by ReganBooks/HarperCollins. It is a parallel novel written by Gregory Maguire and illustrated by Douglas Smith. Based upon the writings of L. Frank Baum, it is a revisionist look at the land and characters of Oz, best known from Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.
The novel presents events, characters and situations from Baum's books and the film in new ways, with several differences between the L. Frank Baum series and the Wicked Cycle. These differences arise from the original Oz functioning as a mirror-image of Kansas in a cultural and economic framework: Oz was wealthy, prosperous and had excellent agricultural yields while Kansas was characterized by economic hardship, environmental difficulties and poor harvests. The social strife described in the Wicked Cycle indicates that the two series are set in similar and internally consistent but distinctly separate visions of Oz.
Unlike the popular 1939 movie and Baum's writings, this novel is not directed at children, and contains adult language and content.
It is the basis for the Broadway musical Wicked by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman.



Son of a Witch
Gregory Maguire
2005
Published by ReganBooks. Sequel to Wicked.


A Lion Among Men
Gregory Maguire
2008
Published by ReganBooks. The third book in "The Wicked Years" .


The Wizard of the Emerald City
Alexander Volkov
1939, 1959
Volkov's original adaptation of The Wizard of Oz. Ellie, 8, and her puppy Totoshka are carried in an hurricane to the Magic Land. After the first shock of the beauty of the land and Totoshka's sudden gift of wise speech, they meet the Fairy of the Yellow Land, Villina, who tells them that she has allowed their house to be taken by the wind to land on the head of Gingema, the Wicked Witch of the Blue Land, and kill her. Now Ellie is called "The Fairy of the Killing House" and is worshipped by the people around. Villina tells Ellie to follow the Yellow Brick Road to find Goodwin, the Great and the Horrible, the ruler of the Magic Land, who lives in the Emerald City. He is supposed to bring Ellie back home to her parents if she fulfills the greatest wishes of three creatures that she will meet on the way. They set off, Ellie wearing the silver shoes that Totoshka has found in Gingema's house. They meet Strashila the scarecow, who dreams to have a brain, The Iron Man, who dreams of a heart, and the Cowardly Lion, who dreams about courage. This novel is nearly the same as the original, with a few minor changes and additions.


Urfin Dzhus and His Wooden Soldiers
Alexander Volkov
1963
The first of Volkov's sequels, all of which have nearly nothing to do with Baum's. In this one, set one year after the events in the first novel, Urfin Dzhus, a former servant of Gingema, discovers a magical powder that brings things to life. He then creates an army of wooden soldiers and sets off to conquer the Magic Land. On her farm in Kansas, Ellie meets a crow bearing a pictured message: Strashila and The Iron Man behind bars. Ellie (with Totoshka) and her uncle, the wooden-legged seaman Charlie Black, set off through the desert and the mountains to help their friends.


Seven Kings of the Underground
Alexander Volkov
1969
Trapped in a huge cave after a collapse, Ellie, now 11, Totoshka and Ellie's cousin Fred (13) are forced to move further into the cave. They end up in the underground of the Magic Land, in the Land of the Seven Kings of the Underground, which is currently caught up in a serious political crisis. The people recognize Ellie as the Fairy of the Killing House and keep her hostage, forcing her to use her magical powers to restore the Magical Spring of Sleepy Water that keeps the order in the country. It is up to Fred now to find a way out to seek help from Ellie's friends.


The Fiery God of the Marrans
Alexander Volkov
1972
Ellie's little sister Annie, born during Ellie's last visit to the Magic Land, and her best friend Tim, dream of seeing the land of their bedtime stories. Their dream is so strong that Fred, now an engineer, creates two mules operating on the sun energy. And so the two children, aged only 8 and 9, take Totoshka's grandson, Artoshka, and set off through the desert. Little do they know that this is not going to be just a social call: The Emerald City is once again conquered by Urfin Dzhus, accompanied now by the primitive tribe of the Marrans, whom he has brainwashed of being a god.


The Yellow Fog
Alexander Volkov
1988
A giant witch named Arachna wakes up after a 5,000 years' sleep. She wishes to rule the Magic Land, but seeing that the people would not surrender, sends on them an eerie Yellow Fog that threatens to bring eternal winter and poison all the people, eventually causing mass death and destruction. Once again Annie, Tim and Artoshka, accompanied by Charlie Black, rush to the rescue. Eventually Charlie builds a giant piloted robot (similar to a Japanese Gundam) that defeats the witch with his 10-meter long sword.


The Secret of the Abandoned Castle
Alexander Volkov
1989
This time the people of the Magic Land have to deal with alien invasion. The inseparable Annie and Tim, now 12 and 13, along with Fred the engineer, arrive to help their friends. They discover that the aliens are not united: some of them, the Arzaks, are enslaved to the Menvits through their hypnotic eyes. The guests of the Outer World discover that the Magic Land may hold the key to the Arzaks' freedom.


Dorothy of Oz
Roger S. Baum
1989
The author is L. Frank Baum's great grandson.


The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass
Stephen King
1997
The characters visit an unpopulated version of the Emerald City, looking the same as it does in the 1939 film. The man sitting on the Wizard's throne turns out to be Marten Broadcloak, an alter-ego of one of the Dark Tower Series' main villains.


Return to Oz
Joan D. Vinge
1985
The book version of the movie Return to Oz (1985), which is based on the second and third books, The Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz.
