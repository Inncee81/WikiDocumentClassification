The following is a list of cryptids and relicts, those animals studied under the field of cryptozoology. Their presumptive existence is often derived from anecdotal or other insufficient scientific evidence.
Every animal on this page is marked as one of the following:

Unconfirmed – cryptids whose existence is alleged but not demonstrated.
Discredited – [explanation] – cryptids who have a body of evidence against their existence.
Proposed [animal name] – cryptids with an accepted alternative explanation.
Extinct – animals who are now extinct, but which cryptozoologists believe may have an extant relict population.

Or as one of the following, if it is not considered a cryptid anymore:

Confirmed – [animal name] – animals once thought to be cryptids but whose existence has now been confirmed.
Hoax – cryptids once thought to be real, but for which it has been conclusively proven that they were a hoax.

This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
