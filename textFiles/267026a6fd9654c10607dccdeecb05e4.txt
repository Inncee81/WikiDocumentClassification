From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116 (pronounced [ˈalbɪn]) was a name intended for a Swedish child who was born in 1991.[1]
Parents Elisabeth Hallin and Lasse Diding had planned to never legally name their child as a protest[2] against the naming law of Sweden (Namnlag (1982:670)), which reads, "First names shall not be approved if they can cause offense or can be supposed to cause discomfort for the one using it, or names which for some obvious reason are not suitable as a first name."
Because the parents failed to register a name by the boy's fifth birthday, a district court in Halmstad, southern Sweden, fined them 5,000 kronor (roughly €500/$600 US). Responding to the fine, the parents submitted the 43-character name in May 1996, claiming that it was "a pregnant, expressionistic development that we see as an artistic creation." The parents suggested the name be understood in the spirit of 'pataphysics. The court rejected the name and upheld the fine.
The parents then tried to change the spelling of the name to A (also pronounced "albin"). Once again, the court refused to approve of the name, citing a prohibition on one-letter naming.
