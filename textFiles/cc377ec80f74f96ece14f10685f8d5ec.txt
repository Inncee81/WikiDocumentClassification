A Thousand Plateaus (French: Mille Plateaux) (1980) is a book by the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. It forms the second part of their Capitalism and Schizophrenia project (the first part being Anti-Œdipus). This book is written as an accumulation of "plateaus", or fields of intensity, rather than a series of chapters (Deleuze and Guattari derived their concept of the "plateau" from a similar concept originated by Gregory Bateson). The concept of a thousand plateaus is borrowed from a Balinese Tantric tradition signifying a non-climactic orgasmic field of a Thousand Plateaus. [1]
In fact, Deleuze and Guattari argued that the entire "book" is not a "book" at all, but a multiplicity of plateaus. Chapters and books are self-contained worlds with beginnings and ends; with climaxes that dissipate the accumulated energy. In contrast, in the act of attaining a plateau one might begin at any point (signifying the absence of a strict beginning), and the accumulated energy of the "climb" is not dissipated in a climax, but instead is experienced as one intensity among many (signifying the absence of a strict end).
The work reflects Deleuze and Guattari's rejection of hierarchical (arborescent) organization in favor of less structured, "rhizomatic" organization. In A Thousand Plateaus they oppose the "nomadic war machine", a force of aggression or resistance that ultimately works toward preserving heterogeneity, to the "state apparatus", which strives toward homogenization and totalitarianism. In the last plateau the noosphere is invoked.
The English translation was made by Brian Massumi. Before the full translation appeared in 1988, the twelfth "plateau" was published separately as Nomadology: The War Machine (New York: Semiotext(e), 1986).
A Thousand Plateaus served as a 'model' for Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's book Empire. Negri, who has also collaborated with Guattari, once called it "the most important philosophical text of the 20th Century."[2]
