[edit] Personal life
Her father was a United States Air Force doctor.[7] Day was home-schooled throughout her childhood and teenage years as her family moved from place to place throughout the South.[7] She has one brother, Ryon Day, who is currently a software engineer. Day's acting career began at the age of 7 when she starred as "Scout" in a local production of To Kill a Mockingbird.[7] Day has also studied ballet professionally and has performed at concerts and competitions nationwide. She is also an accomplished violinist.[7]

[edit] Education
Going straight from home-schooling to college at an early age, Day chose to double major in mathematics and violin performance at the University of Texas at Austin,[8][9] despite having been accepted to the Juilliard School of Music. She graduated with the highest honors, having a 4.0 GPA. She was also the student speaker at her department's convocation.

[edit] Career
After graduation, Day moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. She landed several roles in various short and independent films, as well as commercials and guest spots on television shows, including Undeclared and Maybe It's Me. These parts propelled her to larger roles: a part in the film Bring It On Again, the starring role in June, and a recurring guest spot as potential Slayer Vi on television's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
She is the creator, writer, and star of The Guild, a web series currently in its second season. The first season was primarily hosted on YouTube which garnered it millions of views.[10] Its second season premiered on Microsoft's three major video channels XBox Live, MSN Video and The Zune Marketplace after Microsoft made a deal with The Guild, allowing Day, her cast, and her crew to receive financial remuneration for their work.
In July 2008, Day starred as Penny in the three-part web based musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (created by Joss Whedon, who also created Buffy the Vampire Slayer).[11]
Day was featured as a patient in the episode "Not Cancer" of the medical drama House,[12] and most recently, featured in a series of commercials for Sears,[citation needed] as well as in the first of the revitalized Cheetos commercials.[citation needed]
She is also a heavily followed user on Twitter[original research?]; as of April 2009[update], numbering over 400,000 followers.[13]

[edit] Awards
During the First Annual Streamy Awards held in Los Angeles on March 28, 2009, Day received the award for the "Best Female Actor in a Comedy" for her work in The Guild. She was also recognized for her work on Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.
