Office Open XML (also referred to as OOXML, OpenXML, or Open XML) is a file format for representing spreadsheets, charts, presentations and word processing documents. An Office Open XML document file contains mainly XML-based files compressed within a zip package.
The Office Open XML format specification in 2006 became a free and open Ecma International standard.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] In November 2008, after incorporating some of the proposed changes from ISO/IEC members during standardization process of Office Open XML a revised version of the specification was published as a multi-part International Standard ISO/IEC 29500:2008, Information technology – Office Open XML formats,[9] and as ECMA-376 Office Open XML File Formats - 2nd edition (December 2008). ISO/IEC 29500:2008 is a 4 part standard specification that can be freely downloaded.[10]
Microsoft originally developed the specification as a successor to its earlier binary and Office 2003 XML file formats. The specification was later handed over to Ecma International to be developed as the ECMA-376 standard, under the stewardship of Ecma International Technical Committee TC45. ECMA-376 was published in December 2006[11] and can be freely downloaded from Ecma International.[12]
An amended version of the format received the necessary votes for approval as an ISO/IEC Standard as the result of a JTC 1 fast tracking standardization process that concluded in April 2008.[13]
Starting with Microsoft Office 2007, the Office Open XML file formats (ECMA-376) have become the default file format of Microsoft Office, the currently market-leading office suite.[14][15] Microsoft Office 14 will be the first version to implement the ISO/IEC IS 29500 compliant version of Office Open XML.[16][17][18]

[edit] Background
Prior to the 2007 edition, the core applications of the Microsoft Office software suite (primarily Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) by default stored their data in binary files. Historically, these files were difficult for other applications to interoperate with, due to the lack of publicly available information. Before 2007 Microsoft offered these binary format specifications under a royalty-free license and since 2007 the formats are directly downloadable from their site under a covenant not to sue as part of its Open Specification Promise.[19][20] Due to Microsoft keeping their prior file formats secret, other office software had great difficulty obtaining full levels of interoperability. Microsoft came under increasing pressure to adopt an open file format, in particular several nations adopted rules that official documents should be in an open format.
In 2000, Microsoft released an initial version of an XML-based format for Microsoft Excel, which was incorporated in Office XP. In 2002, a new file format for Microsoft Word followed.[21] The Excel and Word formats – known as the Office 2003 XML formats – were later incorporated into the 2003 release of Microsoft Office.
In May 2004, governments and the European Union recommended to Microsoft that they publish and standardize their XML Office formats through a standardization organization.[21][22] Microsoft announced in November 2005 that it would standardize the new version of their XML-based formats through Ecma International, as "Ecma Office Open XML".[23]

[edit] File format and structure




Office Open XML main components


Office Open XML uses a file package conforming to the Open Packaging Convention. This format uses mechanisms from the ZIP file format and contains the individual files that form the basis of the document. In addition to Office markup, the package can also include embedded files such as images, videos, or other documents.

[edit] Document markup languages
An Office Open XML file may contain several documents encoded in specialized markup languages corresponding to applications within the Microsoft Office product line. Office Open XML defines multiple vocabularies using 27 namespaces and 89 schema modules.
The primary markup languages are:

WordprocessingML for word-processing
SpreadsheetML for spreadsheets
PresentationML for presentations

Shared markup language materials include:

Office Math Markup Language (OMML)
DrawingML used for vector drawing, charts, and for example, text art (additionally, though deprecated, VML is supported for drawing)
Extended properties
Custom properties
Variant Types
Custom XML data properties
Bibliography

In addition to the above markup languages custom XML schemas can be used to extend Office Open XML.
The XML Schema of Office Open XML emphasizes reducing load time and improving parsing speed. In a test with applications current in April 2007, XML-based office documents were slower to load than binary formats.[24] To enhance performance, Office Open XML uses very short element names for common elements and spreadsheets save dates as index numbers (starting from 1899 or from 1904). In order to be systematic and generic, Office Open XML typically uses separate child elements for data and metadata (element names ending in Pr for properties) rather than using multiple attributes, which allows structured properties. Office Open XML does not use mixed content but uses elements to put a series of text runs (element name r) into paragraphs (element name p). The result is terse and highly nested in contrast to HTML, for example, which is fairly flat, designed for humans to write in text editors and is more congenial for humans to read.

[edit] Office MathML (OMML)
Office Math Markup Language is a mathematical markup language which can be embedded in WordprocessingML, with intrinsic support for including word processing markup like revision markings,[25] footnotes, comments, images and elaborate formatting and styles.[26] The OMML format is different from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) MathML recommendation that does not support those office features, but is partially compatible[27] through relatively simple XSL Transformations.
The following Office MathML example defines the fraction: 


<m:oMathPara>
  <m:oMath>
    <m:f>
      <m:num><m:r>
        <m:t>π</m:t>
      </m:r></m:num>
      <m:den><m:r>
        <m:t>2</m:t>
      </m:r></m:den>
    </m:f>
  </m:oMath>
</m:oMathPara>


[edit] DrawingML




Example of DrawingML charts


DrawingML is the vector graphics markup language used in Office Open XML documents. Its major features are the graphics rendering of text elements, graphical vector-based shape elements, graphical tables and charts.
The DrawingML table is the third table model in Office Open XML (next to the table models in WordprocessingML and SpreadsheetML) and is optimized for graphical effects and its main use is in presentations created with PresentationML markup. DrawingML contains graphics effects (like shadows and reflection) that can be used on the different graphical elements that are used in DrawingML. In DrawingML you can also create 3d effects, for instance to show the different graphical elements through a flexible camera viewpoint. It is possible to create separate DrawingML theme parts in an Office Open XML package. These themes can then be applied to graphical elements throughout the Office Open XML package.[28]
DrawingML is unrelated to the other vector graphics formats such as SVG. These can be converted to DrawingML to include natively in an Office Open XML document. This is a different approach to that of the OpenDocument format, which uses a subset of SVG, and includes vector graphics as separate files.
A DrawingML graphic's dimensions are specified in English Metric Units (EMUs). This unit is defined as 1/360,000 of a centimeter and thus there are 914,400 EMUs per inch, and 12,700 EMUs per point. This unit was chosen so that integers can be used to accurately represent most dimensions encountered in a document. Floating point cannot accurately represent a fraction that is not a sum of powers of two and the error is magnified when the fractions are added together many times, resulting in misalignment. As an inch is 2.54 centimeters, or 127/50, the inch must be divided by 127 so that both 1 inch and 1 centimeter are an integer. To accurately represent decimal to 2 digits, a divisor of 100 is needed. To accurately represent a point a divisor of 72 is needed, which also allows divisions of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 to be accurate. Multiplying these together gives 127×72×100 = 914,400 units per inch (the least common multiple would work as well which would have been 228,600 per inch and 90,000 per centimeter). According to Rick Jelliffe, programmer and standards activist (ISO, W3C, IETF), EMUs are a rational solution to a particular set of design criteria.[29]

[edit] Container structure
Main article: Open Packaging Convention




Container structure of Part 2 of the Ecma Office Open XML standard, ECMA-376


Office Open XML documents are stored in Open Packaging Convention (OPC) packages, which are ZIP files containing XML and other data files, along with a specification of the relationships between them.[30] Depending on the type of the document, the packages have different internal directory structures and names. An application will use the relationships files to locate individual sections (files), with each having accompanying metadata, in particular MIME metadata.
A basic package contains an XML file called [Content_Types].xml at the root, along with three directories: _rels, docProps, and a directory specific for the document type (for example, in a .docx word processing package, there would be a word directory). The word directory contains the document.xml file which is the core content of the document.

[Content_Types].xml 
This file describes the contents of the package. It also contains a mapping for file extensions and overrides for specific URIs.
_rels 
This directory contains relationships for the files within the package. To find the relationships for a specific file, look for the _rels directory that is a sibling of the file, and then for a file that has the original file name with a .rels appended to it. For example, if the content types file had any relationships, there would be a file called [Content_Types].xml.rels inside the _rels directory.
_rels/.rel 
This file is where the package relationships are located. Applications look here first. Viewing in a text editor, one will see it outlines each relationship for that section. In a minimal document containing only the basic document.xml file, the relationships detailed are metadata and document.xml.
docProps/core.xml 
This file contains the core properties for any Office Open XML document.
word/document.xml 
This file is the main part for any Word document.


[edit] Relationships

[edit] Relationship files in Office Open XML
An example relationship file (word/_rels/document.xml.rels), is:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<Relationships
  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/package/2005/06/relationships">
  <Relationship Id="rId1"
    Type="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/relationships/image"
    Target="http://en.wikipedia.org/images/wiki-en.png"
    TargetMode="External" />
  <Relationship Id="rId2"
    Type="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/relationships/hyperlink"
    Target="http://www.wikipedia.org"
    TargetMode="External" />
</Relationships>

As such, images referenced in the document can be found in the relationship file by looking for all relationships that are of type http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/relationships/image. To change the used image, edit the relationship.

[edit] Hyperlink relations
The following code shows an example of inline markup for a hyperlink:


<w:hyperlink r:id="rId2" w:history="1"
  xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships" 
  xmlns:w="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main">

In this example, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is represented by "rId2". The actual URL is in the accompanying relationships file, located by the corresponding "rId2" item. Linked images, templates, and other items are referenced in the same way.

[edit] Embedded or linked media file relations
Pictures can be embedded or linked using a tag:


<v:imagedata w:rel="rId1" o:title="example" />

This is the reference to the image file. All references are managed via relationships. For example, a document.xml has a relationship to the image. There is a _rels directory in the same directory as document.xml, inside _rels is a file called document.xml.rels. In this file there will be a relationship definition that contains type, ID and location. The ID is the referenced ID used in the XML document. The type will be a reference schema definition for the media type and the location will be an internal location within the ZIP package or an external location defined with a URL.

[edit] Document properties
Office Open XML uses the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set and DCMI Metadata Terms to store document properties. Dublin Core is a standard for cross-domain information resource description and is defined in ISO 15836:2003.

[edit] Core properties
An example document properties file (docProps/core.xml) that uses Dublin Core metadata, is:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<cp:coreProperties xmlns:cp="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/metadata/core-properties"
  xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"

[edit] Structure of the standard
To aid the reader's understanding, the Office Open XML specification contains both normative material and informative material.

[edit] ISO/IEC 29500:2008
The ISO/IEC standard is structured into four parts, each of which are independent standards.[31][citation needed]

Part 1. Fundamentals and Markup Language Reference (5560 pages)
Contains conformance definitions
Contains the reference material for WordprocessingML, SpreadsheetML, PresentationML, DrawingML, Shared MLs and Custom XML Schema, defining every element and attribute including the element hierarchy (parent/child relationships)
XML schemas for the markup languages are declared as XSD and (non-normatively) using RELAX NG
Defines the custom XML data storing facility
Schemas are included in the text
Part 2. Open Packaging Conventions (129 pages)
Defines the Open Packaging Conventions (package model, physical package)
Defines core properties, thumbnails and digital signatures
XML schemas for the OPC are declared as XML Schema Definitions (XSD) and (non-normatively) using RELAX NG (ISO/IEC 19757-2)
Part 3. Markup Compatibility and Extensibility (40 pages)
Describes extension facilities of OpenXML documents and specifies elements and attributes by which applications with different extensions can interoperate
Extensibility rules are expressed using NVDL (ISO/IEC 19757-4)
Part 4. Transitional Migration Features (1464 pages)
Contains reference material of legacy and transitional interest
Contains controversial material such as compatibility settings and the graphics markup language VML
Contains list of differences between ECMA-376 and ISO/IEC 29500:2008

The standard specifies six levels of document and application conformance, strict and transitional for each of WordprocessingML, PresentationML and SpreadsheetML. The standard also specifies applications descriptions of base and full.

[edit] ECMA-376 1st edition (2006)
The ECMA standard is structured in five parts to meet the needs of different audiences.[12]

Part 1. Fundamentals
Vocabulary, notational conventions and abbreviations
Summary of primary and supporting markup languages
Conformance conditions and interoperability guidelines
Constraints within the Open Packaging Conventions that apply to each document type


Part 2. Open Packaging Conventions
Defines the Open Packaging Conventions (package model, physical package)
Defines core properties, thumbnails and digital signatures
XML schemas for the OPC are declared as XML Schema Definitions (XSD) and (non-normatively) using RELAX NG (ISO/IEC 19757-2)


Part 3. Primer
Informative (non-normative) introduction to WordprocessingML, SpreadsheetML, PresentationML, DrawingML, VML and Shared MLs, providing context and illustrating elements through examples and diagrams
Describes the custom XML data storing facility within a package to support integration with business data


Part 4. Markup Language Reference
Contains the reference material for WordprocessingML, SpreadsheetML, PresentationML, DrawingML, Shared MLs and Custom XML Schema, defining every element and attribute including the element hierarchy (parent/child relationships)
XML schemas for the markup languages are declared as XSD and (non-normatively) using RELAX NG
Defines the custom XML data storing facility


Part 5. Markup Compatibility and Extensibility
Describes extension facilities of OpenXML documents and specifies elements and attributes by which applications with different extensions can interoperate
Extensibility rules are expressed using NVDL (ISO/IEC 19757-4)


[edit] Licensing

[edit] Reasonable and Non Discriminatory
Ecma International provides specifications that "can be freely copied by all interested parties without restrictions".[32] Under the Ecma code of conduct in patent matters, participating and approving member organisations are required to make available their patent rights on a Reasonable and Non Discriminatory (RAND) basis. While making patent rights available on a RAND basis is considered a common minimum patent condition for a standard, international standardization has a clear preference for royalty-free patent licensing. That is why Microsoft, a main contributor to the standard, provided a Covenant Not to Sue[33] for its patent licensing. The covenant received a mixed reception, with some (like the Groklaw blog) identifying problems[34] and others (such as Lawrence Rosen, an attorney and lecturer at Stanford Law School) endorsing it.[35]

[edit] Open Specification Promise
Main article: Open Specification Promise
Microsoft also added the format to their Open Specification Promise[36] in which

"Microsoft irrevocably promises not to assert any Microsoft Necessary Claims against you for making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or distributing any implementation to the extent it conforms to a Covered Specification […]"

subject to certain restrictions. Office Open XML can therefore be used under the Covenant Not to Sue or the Open Specification Promise.
The Open Specification Promise was included in documents submitted to ISO in support of the ECMA-376 fast track submission.[37] Ecma International asserted that, "The OSP enables both open source and commercial software to implement [the specification]."[38]
In support of the licensing arrangements Microsoft commissioned an analysis from the London legal firm Baker & McKenzie.[39]
Several standards and OSS licensing experts expressed support in 2006 of the OSP. A 2006 article in Cover Pages quotes Lawrence Rosen, an attorney and lecturer at Stanford Law School, as saying,

"I'm pleased that this OSP is compatible with free and open source licenses."[40]

In 2006[41], Mark Webbink; a lawyer and member of the board of the Software Freedom Law Center, and former employee of Linux vendor Red Hat; has said,

"Red Hat believes that the text of the OSP gives sufficient flexibility to implement the listed specifications in software licensed under free and open source licenses. We commend Microsoft’s efforts to reach out to representatives from the open source community and solicit their feedback on this text, and Microsoft's willingness to make modifications in response to our comments."[42]

Standards lawyer Andy Updegrove said in 2006 the Open Specification Promise was

"[…] what I consider to be a highly desirable tool for facilitating the implementation of open standards, in particular where those standards are of interest to the open source community."[43]

On March 12, 2008 the Software Freedom Law Center, which provides services to protect and advance free software and open source software, has warned of problems with the Open Specification Promise as it relates to Office Open XML and the GNU General Public License (GPL).[44] In a published analysis of the promise it states that[45]



"Any code that implements the specification may also do other things in other contexts, so in effect the OSP does not cover any actual code, only some uses of code."[46]
"...it permits implementation under free software licenses so long as the resulting code isn't used freely."[46]
"The OSP cannot be relied upon by GPL developers for their implementations not because its provisions conflict with GPL, but because it does not provide the freedom that the GPL requires."[46]



Microsoft amended the OSP FAQ to specifically assure GPL license users that the open licensing of its covered formats through the Open Specification Promise applies to users of the GPL license when implementing covered implementations:

"The OSP provides the assurance that Microsoft will not assert its Necessary Claims against anyone who make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or distribute any Covered Implementation under any type of development or distribution model, including the GPL."[47]

Legal experts and academics[who?] have confirmed that the licensing is similar to the licensing terms offered by IBM, and to a lesser extent Sun and Adobe Systems on their Office formats but warned that ambiguous legal jargon contained in Microsoft's Open Specification Promise, although understood in the terminology of the specialist patent and intellectual property law community, makes it hard for small developers to determine with certainty that Microsoft will not be entitled to sue them for using OOXML. They[who?] criticize Microsoft for not explicitly defining which parts of the specification contains intellectual property.[citation needed] The OSP has never been tested in a court of law regarding intellectual property rights, and the OSP does not name which court or jurisdiction a dispute will be heard in. David Vaile, executive director of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre at the University of New South Wales, acknowledges that the Microsoft approach to its Open Specification Promise is similar although not identical to other approaches used by IBM, and to a lesser extent Adobe and Sun, and that these represent a substantial advance on the past practice of negotiating long case-by-case agreements.[48]

[edit] Standardization
Main article: Standardization of Office Open XML
Office Open XML is an Ecma standard (Ecma-376, approved on 7 December 2006). ECMA-376 was created using as a basis a new version of the Microsoft Office 2003 XML file format, donated by Microsoft, which was being created for Microsoft Office 12.
The specification entered fast-track standardization within ISO/IEC as DIS 29500 (Draft International Standard 29500).[49] In a September 2007 vote by ISO/IEC member bodies, the draft text was not approved as an international standard. A ballot resolution process in March 2008 amended the text.
On April 2, 2008, ISO and IEC officially stated that the DIS 29500 had been approved for acceptance as an ISO/IEC Standard, pending any appeals.[13] In accordance with the JTC 1 directives the Project Editor created a new version with the final text within a month after the BRM, to be published as ISO/IEC 29500. After review and corrections this text has been distributed to the members of SC34.[50]
On May 21, 2008, Microsoft announced that it will be an active participant in the future evolution of the Office Open XML standard.[16]
In October 2008, ISO/IEC committee JTC1/SC34 (Document Description and Processing Languages) created a working group for maintenance of the ISO/IEC 29500 standard within ISO/IEC.[51]
In November 2008, the new international standard was published as ISO/IEC 29500:2008, Information technology – Office Open XML formats.
In December 2008, Ecma International published ECMA-376 Office Open XML File Formats - 2nd edition, an updated version of ECMA-376 that is identical to ISO/IEC 29500:2008.

The Microsoft Office applications Word, Excel and PowerPoint 2007 and later promote the Office Open XML format, as it is used as their default file format. Several groups and companies support the Office Open XML document format. For example:

Information technology companies like Apple, Intel, Microsoft, NextPage, Novell, Toshiba and government institutions that archive documents such as The British Library and The United States Library of Congress promote the Office Open XML formats, as well as other companies who may or may not be working inside the Ecma International Office Open XML technical committee (TC45).


The Open XML Community site launched in May 2007, with 327 inaugural members. The community has now grown to over 3,100 members.[52]


Former Gnome Foundation board member Miguel de Icaza, who started the GNOME project, showed support for the Office Open XML document format.[53][54]


The non-profit organization RosettaNet Malyasia announced the release of a business-to-business standard called RosettaNet Automated Enablement standard (RAE) using the Office Open XML document standard.[55]


Members and partners of the Interop Vendor Alliance (IVA) test and promote interoperability of Office Open XML files across a wide range of applications on mixed platforms.[56]


The Open XML Developer site was launched to promote these formats and to support developers impementing the specification.


[edit] Criticism of ECMA-376 1st edition
The ODF Alliance UK Action Group has stated that with OpenDocument an ISO-standard for Office files already exists.[57] Further, they argue that the Office Open XML file-format is heavily based on Microsoft's own Office applications and is thus not vendor-neutral, and that it has inconsistencies with existing ISO standards such as time and date formats and color codes.[57]

[edit] Specific criticism

Use of DrawingML and the transitional-use-only VML instead of W3C recommendation SVG.[58] VML did not become a W3C recommendation.[59]
Use of Office MathML instead of W3C recommendation MathML.[60]
Office Open XML does not define a macro language, leaving this aspect to be application-defined.[61]
The standard is long, with the version submitted to ISO comprising 6546 pages. Google alleges that this length is unnecessary, saying that the OpenDocument specification is 867 pages in length and achieves the same goals.[62] That coupled with the fast track standardization process, Google notes, reduces the review time per page ratio.[62]
A comparison of some specific items in the format specification documents of Office Open XML and OpenDocument formats is used to claim disharmony within the Office Open XML format. For example, OOXML implements three different methods for specifying the color and alignment of text depending on whether the document is a text, spreadsheet, or presentation whereas ODF uses the same method for all three.[63]


[edit] Worldwide adoption

[edit] Belgium
Belgium's Federal Public Service for Information and Communication Technology is evaluating the adoption of the Office Open XML format. Federal administrations may use the file format for creating, saving and exchanging office documents.[64]

[edit] Commonwealth of Massachusetts
The US state of Massachusetts has been examining its options for implementing XML-based document processing. In early 2005, Eric Kriss, Secretary of Administration and Finance in Massachusetts, was the first government official in the United States to publicly connect open formats to a public policy purpose: "It is an overriding imperative of the American democratic system that we cannot have our public documents locked up in some kind of proprietary format, perhaps unreadable in the future, or subject to a proprietary system license that restricts access."[65] Since 2007 Massachusetts classifies Office Open XML as "Open Format" and has amended its approved technical standards list — the Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM) — to include Office Open XML. Massachusetts now formally endorses Office Open XML formats for its public records.[66]

[edit] Denmark
In June 2007, the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation recommended that beginning with January 1, 2008 public authorities must support at least one of the two word processing document formats Office Open XML and ODF in all new IT solutions, where appropriate.[67]

[edit] Germany
In Germany the Office Open XML standard is currently under observation by the governmental office for standards in public IT („Koordinierungs- und Beratungsstelle der Bundesregierung für Informationstechnik in der Bundesverwaltung“ (KBSt), see SAGA 4.0[68]). It may be used to exchange complex documents when further processing is required.

[edit] Lithuania
Lithuanian Standards Board has adopted the ISO/IEC 29500:2008 Office Open XML format standard as Lithuanian National standard. The decision was made by Technical Committee 4 Information Technology on March 5, 2009. The proposal to adopt the Office Open XML format standard was submitted by Lithuanian Archives Department under the Government of the Republic of Lithuania.[69]

[edit] Norway
Norway's Ministry of Government Administration and Reform is evaluating the adoption of the Office Open XML format. The ministry put the document standard under observation in December 2007.[70]

[edit] Switzerland
In July 2007, the Swiss Federal Council announced adherence SAGA.ch e-Government standards mandatory for its departments as well as for cantons, cities and municipalities. The latest version of SAGA.ch includes Office Open XML file formats.[71]

[edit] Implementations of new 2008 version





This article or section contains information about scheduled or expected future software.
The content may change as the software release approaches and more information becomes available.





The newest version of Office Open XML is formally known as either ISO/IEC 29500:2008 or as ECMA-376 2nd edition (December 2008). Microsoft has stated that Microsoft Office 14 will be the first version of Microsoft Office to support ISO/IEC 29500, though no release date has been announced.[16]
On July 28, 2008 Murray Sargent, a software development engineer in the Microsoft Office team confirmed that Word 2007 will have a service pack release that enables it to read and write ISO standard OOXML files.[120]
Microsoft, whose products currently only support the ECMA-376 standard version of Office Open XML, has committed to using the ISO/IEC 29500 standard in their products[121] and has also committed to participate in the maintenance of this standard.
In a ZDNet article Alex Brown, leader of the ISO/IEC group in charge of deciding maintenance processes for any ISO/IEC 29500 Standard, stated

"I am hoping that Microsoft Office will shortly be brought into line with the [ISO/IEC] 29500 specification, and will stay that way".[122]

On March 13, 2008 Doug Mahugh, a Senior Product Manager at Microsoft specializing in Office client interoperability and the Open XML file formats confirmed that version 1.0 of the Open XML Format SDK

"will definitely be 100% compliant with the final ISO/IEC 29500 spec, including the changes accepted at the BRM".[123]

In a ComputerWorld interview from 2008, Doug Mahugh said that

"Microsoft would continue to update the SDK to make sure that applications built with it remained compliant with an Open XML standard as changes were made in the future".[124]


[edit] Implementations

Microsoft Open XML Format SDK[125] contains a set of managed code libraries to create and manipulate Office Open XML files programmatically. Version 1.0 was released on June 10, 2008[126] and incorporates the changes made to the Office Open XML specification made during the current ISO/IEC standardization process.[127][128] Version 2 of the Open XML SDK supports validating Office Open XML documents against the Office Open XML schema, as well as searching in Office Open XML documents.[127]
PowerTools for Open XML, a set of free open source cmdlets for Windows PowerShell to create and manipulate Office Open XML files at the command line or using shell scripts.[129][130][131]
