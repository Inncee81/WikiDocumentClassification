Sun Grid Engine (SGE), previously known as CODINE (COmputing in DIstributed Networked Environments) or GRD (Global Resource Director),[1] is an open source batch-queuing system, developed and supported by Sun Microsystems. Sun also sells a commercial product based on SGE, also known as N1 Grid Engine (N1GE).
SGE is typically used on a computer farm or high-performance computing (HPC) cluster and is responsible for accepting, scheduling, dispatching, and managing the remote and distributed execution of large numbers of standalone, parallel or interactive user jobs. It also manages and schedules the allocation of distributed resources such as processors, memory, disk space, and software licenses.
SGE is the foundation of the Sun Grid utility computing system, made available over the Internet in the United States in 2006,[2] later becoming available in many other countries.

[edit] Features new in version 6.2

Advance reservation
Array job interdependencies
Enhanced remote execution (without using external rshd/rlogind/sshd processes)
Multi-clustering [3]
Daemons managed by the Service Management Facility on Solaris
Pseudo TTY (pty) support for interactive jobs

Other features of SGE include:

Multiple advanced scheduling algorithms allow powerful policy-based resource allocation
Cluster queues
Job and scheduler fault tolerance - Grid Engine continues to operate as long as there is one or more hosts available
Job checkpointing
Job arrays and job tasks
DRMAA (Job API)
Resource reservation
XML status reporting (qstat and qhost), and the xml-qstat web interface
Parallel jobs (MPI, PVM, OpenMP), and scalable parallel job startup with qrsh [4]
Usage accounting
Accounting and Reporting COnsole (ARCO)
parallel make: distmake, dmake (Sun Studio), and SGE's own qmake
FLEXlm integration [5] and multi-cluster software license management with LicenseJuggler [6]


[edit] Platforms
SGE runs on multiple platforms, including:

AIX
BSD - FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
HP-UX
IRIX
Linux
Mac OS X
Solaris
SUPER-UX
Tru64
Windows via SFU or SUA (as execution hosts only)
Z/OS (in progress)


[edit] Cluster architecture
A typical Grid Engine cluster consists of a master host, and one or more execution hosts. Moreover, multiple shadow masters can be configured as hot spares, which take over the role of the master when the original master host crashes.

[edit] Support and training
Sun provides support contracts [7] for the commercial version of Grid Engine on most UNIX platforms and Windows. Professional services, consulting, training, and support are also provided by Sun Partners. [8] Sun partners with Georgetown University to deliver Grid Engine administration classes.[9] The Bioteam runs short SGE training workshops that are 1 or 2 days long.[10]
Users can get community support on the Grid Engine mailing lists.[11]
Grid Engine Workshops were held in 2002, 2003, and 2007 in Regensburg, Germany.[12]

[edit] Prominent users
Notable deployments of SGE include:

Sun Grid
the TSUBAME supercomputer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology,[13] which was number 7 on June 2006 TOP500 list.
Ranger at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). Ranger has 62,976 processor cores in 3,936 nodes and a peak performance of 504TFlops. [14] [15] Ranger is currently the 4th most powerful TOP500 supercomputer. [16]
San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (NOAA GFDL)


[edit] History
In 2000, Sun acquired Gridware, Inc. a privately owned commercial vendor of advanced computing resource management software with offices in San Jose, Calif., and Regensburg, Germany.[17] Later that year, Sun offered a free version of Gridware for Solaris and Linux, and renamed the product Sun Grid Engine.
In 2001, Sun made the source code available,[18] and adopted the open source development model. Ports for Mac OS X and *BSD were contributed by the non-Sun open source developers.

[edit] Other Grid Engine based products

Sun Constellation System
Sun Visualization System
Sun Compute Cluster [19]
ClusterVisionOS Distribution
Rocks Cluster Distribution
EGEE [20]
Univa UD's UniCluster Express
BioTeam's iNquiry


[edit] Add-on software
A number of SGE add-ons are available:

Solaris Cluster integration [21]
Service Domain Management module in order to meet service level objectives
Transfer-queue Over Globus (TOG). Globus does not officially support SGE, but the London e-Science Center has created a package and provides instructions on how to configure a Globus Toolkit server so that it can submit jobs for execution on a local Sun Grid Engine installation.
JOb Scheduling Hierarchically (JOSH)
