The seven chakras (Devanāgarī: चक्र) and the Mahābhūta (Devanāgarī: महाभूत) in Tantric tradition. Yoga and Tantra have influenced traditional Ayurvedic medicine.


Ayurveda (Devanāgarī: आयुर्वॆद, the 'science of life') is a system of traditional medicine native to India,[1] and practiced in other parts of the world as a form of alternative medicine.[2] In Sanskrit, the word Ayurveda comprises the words āyus, meaning 'life' and veda, meaning 'science'.[1] Evolving throughout its history, Ayurveda remains an influential system of medicine in South Asia.[3] The earliest literature of Ayurveda appeared during the Vedic period in India.[2] The Sushruta Samhita and the Charaka Samhita were influential works on traditional medicine during this era.[2] Ayurvedic practitioners also claim to have identified a number of medicinal preparations and surgical procedures for curing various ailments and diseases.[4]
Ayurveda is considered to be a form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) within the western world, where several of its methods—such as herbs, massage, and Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine—are applied on their own as a form of CAM treatment.[5]

[edit] Overview




Traditional Indian ayurvedic spa in Goa.


Ayurveda believes in 'five great elements' (Devanāgarī: पंचतत्व‌; earth, water, fire, air and space) forming the universe, including the human body.[1] Chyle, Blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, and semen are believed to be the seven primary constituent elements (Devanāgarī: सप्तधातु) of the body.[6] Ayurveda stresses a balance of three substances: wind/spirit/air, phlegm, and bile, each representing divine forces.[6] According to Ayurvedic beliefs, the doctrine of these three Doshas (Devanāgarī: त्रिदॊश्)—vata (wind/spirit/air), pitta (bile) and kapha (phlegm)—is important.[7] Traditional beliefs hold that humans possess a unique constellation of Doshas.[7] In Ayurveda, the human body has 20 Guna (Devanāgarī: गुन, meaning quality).[8] Surgery and surgical instruments are employed.[8] It is believed that building a healthy metabolic system, attaining good digestion, and proper excretion leads to vitality.[8] Ayurveda also focuses on exercise, yoga, meditation, and massage.[9]
The concept of Panchakarma (Devanāgarī: पंचकर्म‌) is believed to eliminate toxic elements from the body.[10] Eight disciplines of Ayurveda treatment, called Ashtanga (Devanāgarī: अष्टांग), are given below:[11]

Surgery (Shalya-chikitsa).
Treatment of diseases above the clavicle (Salakyam).
Internal medicine (Kaaya-chikitsa).
Demonic possession (Bhuta vidya): Ayurveda believes in demonic intervention and—as a form of traditional medicine—identifies a number of ways to counter the supposed effect of these interferences.[12] Bhuta vidya has been called psychiatry.[2]
Paediatrics (Kaumarabhrtyam).
Toxicology (Agadatantram).
Prevention and building immunity (rasayanam).
Aphrodisiacs (Vajikaranam).


[edit] Practices




Several philosophers In India combined religion and traditional medicine—notable examples being that of Buddhism and Ayurveda. Shown in the image is the philosopher Nagarjuna—known chiefly for his doctrine of the Madhyamika (middle path)—who wrote medical works The Hundred Prescriptions and The Precious Collection, among others.[13]


Buddhism may have been an influence on the development of many of Ayurveda's central ideas—particularly its fascination with balance, known in Buddhism as Madhyamika (Devanāgarī: माध्यमिक).[14] Balance is emphasized; suppressing natural urges is seen to be unhealthy, and doing so may almost certainly lead to illness.[14] To stay within the limits of reasonable balance and measure is stressed upon.[14] Ayurveda places an emphasis on moderation in food intake, sleep, sexual intercourse, and the intake of medicine.[14]
Ayurveda incorporates an entire system of dietary recommendations.[1] Chopra (2003)—on the subject of Ayurveda dietetics—writes:[15]


Ayurvedic dietetics comprise a host of recommendations, ranging from preparation and consumption of food, to healthy routines for day and night, sexual life, and rules for ethical conduct. In contrast to contemporary practitioners of New Age Ayurveda, older Ayurvedic authors tended to be religiously neutral. Even Buddhist authors refrained from trying to convert the patient to follow their particular religious ways.





For diagnosis the patient is to be questioned and all five senses are to be employed.[16] The Charaka Samhita recommends a tenfold examination of the patient.[16] The qualities to be judged are: constitution, abnormality, essence, stability, body measurements, diet suitability, psychic strength, digestive capacity, physical fitness and age.[16] Hearing is used to observe the condition of breathing and speech.[6] The study of the vital pressure points or marma is of special importance.[8]
Chopra (2003) identifies five influential criteria for diagnosis: 'origin of the disease, prodrominal (precursory) symptoms, typical symptoms of the fully developed disease, observing the effect of therapeutic procedures, and the pathological process.'[16]
Hygiene—also a component of religious virtue to many Indians—is a strong belief.[6] Hygienic living involves regular bathing, cleansing of teeth, skin care, and eye washing.[6] Occasional anointing of the body with oil is also prescribed.[6]




Oils—such as sesame and sunflower oil—are extensively used in Ayurvedic medicine. Studies show that both these oils contain substantial amount of linoleate in triglyceride form. Oils rich in linoleic acid may have antineoplastic properties.[17]






Hundreds of vegetable drugs are used in Ayurvedic medicine—including cardamom and cinnamon.[18]


Ayurveda stresses the use of vegetable drugs.[6] Fats are used both for consumption and for external use.[6] Hundreds of vegetable drugs are employed, including cardamom and cinnamon.[6] Some animal products may also be used, for example milk, bones, and gallstones etc.[6] Minerals—including sulfur, arsenic, lead, copper sulfate, gold—are also consumed as prescribed.[6]
In some cases alcohol is used as a narcotic for the patient undergoing an operation.[6] The advent of Islam introduced opium as a narcotic.[11] Both oil and tar are used to stop bleeding.[6] Oils may be used in a number of ways including regular consumption as a part of food, anointing, smearing, head massage, and prescribed application to infected areas.[19]
The proper function of channels—tubes that exist within the body and transport fluids from one point to another—is seen as vital, and the lack of healthy channels may lead to disease and insanity.[20] Sushruta identifies that blockages of these channels may lead to rheumatism, epilepsy, paralysis, and convulsions as fluids and channels are diverted from their ideal locations.[20] Sweating is favored as a manner in which to open up the channels and dilute the Doshas causing the blockages and harming a patient—a number of ways to take steam bathing and other steam related cures are recommended so that these toxins are released.[20]

[edit] History




The mantra ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ written on rocks. Chanting mantras has been a feature of Ayurveda since the Atharvaveda—a largely religious text—was compiled.[21]


Ayurveda traces its origins to the Vedas—the Atharvaveda in particular—and is connected to religion and mythology.[22] The Sushruta Samhita of Sushruta appeared during the 1st millennium BCE.[4] Dwivedi & Dwivedi (2007)— on the work of the surgeon Sushruta—write:[4]


The main vehicle of the transmission of knowledge during that period was by oral method. The language used was Sanskrit — the vedic language of that period (2000-500 BC). The most authentic compilation of his teachings and work is presently available in a treatise called Sushruta Samhita. This contains 184 chapters and description of 1120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources.





Underwood & Rhodes (2008) hold that this early phase of traditional Indian medicine identified 'fever (takman), cough, consumption, diarrhea, dropsy, abscesses, seizures, tumours, and skin diseases (including leprosy).'[6] Treatment of complex ailments—including angina pectoris, diabetes, hypertension, and stones—also ensued during this period.[23][4] Plastic surgery, cataract surgery, puncturing to release fluids in the abdomen, extraction of foreign elements, treatment of anal fistulas, treating fractures, amputations, cesarean sections, and stitching of wounds were known.[6] The use of herbs and surgical instruments became widespread.[6]




Cataract in Human Eye—magnified view seen on examination with a slit lamp. Cataract surgery was known to the physician Sushruta.[24] In India, cataract surgery was performed with a special tool called the Jabamukhi Salaka, a curved needle used to loosen the lens and push the cataract out of the field of vision.[24] The eye would later be soaked with warm butter and then bandaged.[24]


Other early works of Ayurveda include the Charaka Samhita, attributed to Charaka.[6] The earliest surviving excavated written material which contains the works of Sushruta is the Bower Manuscript—dated to the 4th century CE.[25] The Bower manuscript cites directly from Sushruta, and is of special interest to historians due to the presence of Indian medicine and its concepts in Central Asia.[26] Vagbhata—the son of a senior doctor by the name of Simhagupta—[27] also compiled his works on traditional medicine.[6] Early Ayurveda had a school of physicians and a school of surgeons.[2] Tradition holds that the text Agnivesh tantra—written by the legendary sage Agnivesh, a student of the mythological sage Bharadwaja—influenced the writings of Ayurveda.[28]
The Chinese pilgrim Fa Hsien (ca. 337 - 422 CE) wrote about the health care system of the Gupta empire (320 - 550 CE) and—in the process—described the institutional approach of Indian medicine which is also visible in the works of Charaka, who mentions a clinic and how it should be equipped.[29] Madhava (700 CE), Sarngadhara (1300 CE), and Bhavamisra (1500 CE) compiled works on Indian medicine.[26] The medical works of both Sushruta and Charaka were translated into the Arabic language during the Abbasid Caliphate (750 CE).[30] These Arabic works made their way into Europe via intermediaries.[31] In Italy the Branca family of Sicily and Gaspare Tagliacozzi (Bologna) became familiar with the techniques of Sushruta.[31]
British physicians traveled to India to see Rhinoplasty being performed by native methods.[32] Reports on Indian Rhinoplasty were published in the Gentleman's Magazine by 1794.[32] Joseph Constantine Carpue spent 20 years in India studying local plastic surgery methods.[32] Carpue was able to perform the first major surgery in the western world by 1815.[33] Instruments described in the Sushruta Samhita were further modified in the Western World.[33]


[edit] Current status

[edit] Within South Asia
In 1970, the Indian Medical Central Council Act was passed by the Parliament of India, which aims to standardize qualifications for Ayurveda and provide accredited institutions for its study and research.[34] In India, over 100 colleges offer degrees in traditional Ayurvedic medicine.[9] The Indian government supports research and teaching in Ayurveda through many channels—both at the national and state levels—and helps institutionalize traditional medicine so that it can be studied in major towns and cities.[35] The state-sponsored Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS) is the apex institution for promotion of traditional medicine in India.[36] The studies conducted by this institution encompass clinical, drug, literary, and family welfare research.[36]
Many successful clinics are run by professionals who qualify from these institutes—both in the urban and the rural areas.[34] Mukherjee & Wahile cite World Health Organization statistics to demonstrate the popularity of traditional medicine, on which a significant number of the world's population depends for primary health care.[37] In Sri Lanka the number of traditional Ayurveda practitioners is greater than trained modern medicine professionals.[38] The manufacture and marketing of Ayurvedic medicine has been commercially successful for several pharmaceutical companies.[34]

[edit] Outside India
Ayurveda practitioners require a license in another stream of health care in the United States of America.[9] Academic institutions related to traditional medicine in India have contributed to Ayurveda's international visibility.[39] Kurup (2003) comments on the role of Gujarat Ayurved University:[39]


The Gujarat Ayurved University has signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with nine Ayurvedic institutes functioning in Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Italy, Argentina, and Germany to coordinate and facilitate the globalization of Ayurveda through academic collaboration. Earlier, Medical (Ayu) Institute of Russia had signed the MoU with the government of India, in which Gujarat Aryurved University is also one of the implementing authorities.





Ayurveda gained recognition in the Western world as medical scholars researched and outlined its various postulates.[40] In the United States of America, the NIH NCCAM expends some of its $123 million budget on Ayurvedic medicine research. In addition, the National Institute of Ayurvedic Medicine, established by Dr. Scott Gerson, is an example of a research institute that has carried out research into Ayurvedic practices.[41] Gerson has published part of his work on the antifungal activities of certain Ayurvedic plants in academic journals.[42] The postulates and history of Ayurveda have also been outlined by foreign scholars—such as Dominik Wujastyk in the United Kingdom.[43]

[edit] Patents
In December 1993, the University of Mississippi Medical Center had a patent issued to them by United States Patent and Trademark Office on the use of turmeric for healing.[44] The patent was contested by India's industrial research organization, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (C.S.I.R), on the grounds that traditional Ayurvedic practitioners were already aware of the healing properties of the substance and have been for centuries, making this patent a case of bio-piracy.[45] The Government of India had become involved in promoting traditional medicine by 1997.[46] Sharma & Bodeker report on the various government activities in relation with Ayurveda:[46]


In India the government became involved in traditional drug production when the Central Drug Research Institute patented two new drugs from ancient Ayurvedic formulas. One, a mixture of black pepper, long pepper, and ginger, allows for the dosage of the antibiotic rifampicin to be halved in the treatment of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. The other is a memory tonic produced from the traditional plant called brahmi. Overseas patenting of turmeric and products of the neem tree caused controversy in India and other nations. In August the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled a U.S. patent on the wound-healing properties of turmeric when the Indian government proved that records had existed for this use for centuries.






[edit] Scientific evidence




Chemical structure of curcumin used in Ayurvedic medicine. Shown here in its ketone form.






Research suggests that Terminalia arjuna is useful in alleviating the pain of angina pectoris and in treating heart failure and coronary artery disease. Terminalia may also be useful in treating hypercholesterolemia[47]


As a traditional medicine, many Ayurveda products have not been tested in rigorous scientific studies and clinical trials.[48] In India, research in Ayurveda is largely undertaken by the statutory body of the Central Government, the Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS), through a national network of research institutes.[49] A systematic review of Ayurveda treatments for rheumatoid arthritis concluded that there was insufficient evidence, as most of the trials were not done properly, and the one high-quality trial showed no benefits.[50] A review of Ayurveda and cardiovascular disease concluded that while the herbal evidence is not yet convincing, the spices are appropriate, some herbs are promising, and yoga is also a promising complementary treatment.[51]
Some ayurvedic products, mainly herbs used for phytotherapy, have been tested with promising results. Turmeric and its derivative curcumin appears to have beneficial properties.[52] Tinspora cordifolia has been tested.[53] Among the medhya rasayanas (intellect rejuvenation), two varieties of Salvia have been tested in small trials; one trial provided evidence that Salvia lavandulifolia (Spanish sage) may improve word recall in young adults,[54] and another provided evidence that Salvia officinalis (Common sage) may improve symptoms in Alzheimer's patients.[55] In some cases Ayurvedic medicine may provide clues to therapeutic compounds. For example, derivatives of snake venom have various therapeutic properties.[56] Many plants used as rasayana (rejuvenation) medications are potent antioxidants.[57] Neem appears to have beneficial pharmacological properties as well.[58]




Azadirachta indica—believed to have immunopotentiating abilities and used often as an anti-infective—has been found to enhance the production of IL-2 and increase immunity in human volunteers by boostinglymphocyteand T-cell count in three weeks.[59]






Black pepper and long pepper are combined with ginger to form the traditionaltrikatu mixture in Ayurveda. This mixture increases appetite, promotes the secretion of digestive juices, and cures certaingastric disorders—particularly Achlorhydria and Hypochlorhydria.[60]


Mitra & Rangesh (2003) hold that cardamom and cinnamon are believed to stimulate digestive enzymes that break down polymeric macromolecules in the human body.[18] Research suggests that Terminalia arjuna is useful in alleviating the pain of angina pectoris and in treating heart failure and coronary artery disease.[47] Terminalia arjuna may also be useful in treating hypercholesterolemia.[47] Azadirachta indica is believed to have immunopotentiating abilities and is used often as an anti-infective.[59] It has been found to enhance the production of IL-2 and increase immunity in human volunteers by boosting lymphocyte and T-cell count in three weeks.[59] Both black pepper and long pepper find application in Ayurvedic medicine in conjunction with ginger to form trikatu—a traditional mixture.[60] Trikatu has been suggested to increase appetite, promote the secretion of digestive juices, and cure certain gastric disorders—particularly achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria.[60]
Scientist Richard Dawkins has openly criticized the use of Ayurveda in the west, claimimg that while westerners are turning to Ayurveda, Indians are "voting with their feet" and turning to modern medicine. Furthermore, he says that “The idea that ancient equals years of accumulated wisdom is a fallacy...Resuscitating Ayurveda today is rather like bringing back bleeding with leeches.”[61]

[edit] Safety Concerns
Major safety concerns include adulteration of herbal medicines with toxic metals, and intrinsic toxicity of herbal medications. Some traditional Ayurvedic treatmnents use toxic metals, herbs, and minerals as part of their remedies. Rasa shastra, the practice of adding metals, minerals or gems to herbs, increases the likelihood of toxic metals such as lead, mercury, or arsenic in the remedy.[62]
A 2004 study found toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic in 20% of Ayurvedic preparations that were made in South Asia for sale around Boston and extrapolated the data to America. It concluded that excess consumption of these products could cause health risks.[63] A 2008 study found that approximately 20% of remedies (and 40% of rasa shastra medicines) purchased over the internet from both US and Indian suppliers were contaminated with toxic metals.[62]
Traditionally the toxicity of these materials are believed to be reduced through processes such as samskaras or shodhanas (for metals), which is similar to the Chinese pao zhi, although the Ayurvedic technique is more complex and may involve prayers as well as physical pharmacy techniques.[64] Rigorous evidence that the metals may be rendered nontoxic is not available, and case reports describe adverse effects to these metals.[62]
There is evidence that using some Ayurvedic medicines, especially those involving herbs, metals, minerals, or other materials involves potentially serious risks, including toxicity.[65][48] Adverse reactions to herbs due their pharmacology are described in traditional Ayurveda texts, but Ayurvedic practitioners are reluctant to admit that herbs could be toxic and the reliable information on herbal toxicity is not easily available.[66]
Following concerns about metal toxicity, the Government of India ruled that Ayurvedic products must specify their metallic content directly on the labels of the product.[67] The harmful effects of the samples is attributed in part to the adulterated raw material and lack of workers trained in traditional medicine.[68] In a letter to the Indian Academy of Sciences, Patwardhan Bhushan—director of the Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences, University of Pune—stated that the metal adulteration is due to contamination and carelessness during the modern manufacturing processes. These modern processes, which are quicker than the safer traditional methods of preparation, are to blame for the heavy level of toxicity in traditional medicine.[69] Bhushan further wrote: "Presence of spurious substances in market samples is not new. However, it does not reflect adversely on the importance of modern medicine. For instance, cyanide tainted Tylenol5. Therefore, conclusion of Saper et al. that ‘users of Ayurvedic medicine may be at risk for heavy metal toxicity’ is certainly not justified. It only relates to certain samples of Ayurvedic medicines from certain companies in certain locations."[69] The marketing of these contaminated products has resulted in decline of Ayurveda in India as well as abroad.[68]

Its earliest concepts are set out in the sacred writings called the Vedas, especially in the metrical passages of the Atharvaveda, which may possibly date as far back as the 2nd millennium BC. According to a later writer, the system of medicine called Āyurveda was received by a certain Dhanvantari from Brahma, and Dhanvantari was deified as the god of medicine. In later times his status was gradually reduced, until he was credited with having been an earthly king who died of snakebite. — Underwood & Rhodes (2008)

Crude aconite is an extremely lethal substance. However, the science of Ayurveda looks upon aconite as a therapeutic entity. Crude aconite is always processed i.e. it undergoes 'samskaras' before being utilised in the Ayurvedic formulations. This study was undertaken in mice, to ascertain whether 'processed' aconite is less toxic as compared to the crude or unprocessed one. It was seen that crude aconite was significantly toxic to mice (100% mortality at a dose of 2.6 mg/mouse) whereas the fully processed aconite was absolutely non-toxic (no mortality at a dose even 8 times as high as that of crude aconite). Further, all the steps in the processing were essential for complete detoxification. - Thorat S, Dahanukar S (July 1991). "Can we dispense with Ayurvedic samskaras?". J Postgrad Med 37 (3): 157–9.
