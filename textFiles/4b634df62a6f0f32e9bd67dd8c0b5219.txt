[edit] Plot summary
Blindness is the story of an unexplained mass epidemic of blindness afflicting nearly everyone in an unnamed city, and the social breakdown that swiftly follows. The novel follows the misfortunes of a handful of characters who are among the first to be stricken and centers around a doctor and his wife, several of the doctor’s patients, and assorted others, thrown together by chance. This group bands together in a family-like unit to survive by their wits and by the unexplained good fortune that the doctor’s wife has escaped the blindness. The sudden onset and unexplained origin and nature of the blindness cause widespread panic, and the social order rapidly unravels as the government attempts to contain the apparent contagion and keep order via increasingly repressive and inept measures.
The first part of the novel follows the experiences of the central characters in the filthy, overcrowded asylum where they and other blind people have been quarantined. Hygiene, living conditions, and morale degrade horrifically in a very short period, mirroring the society outside.
Anxiety over the availability of food, caused by delivery irregularities, act to undermine solidarity; and lack of organization prevents the internees from fairly distributing food or chores. Soldiers assigned to guard the asylum and look after the well-being of the internees become increasingly antipathetic as one soldier after another becomes infected. The military refuse to allow in basic medicines, so that a simple infection becomes deadly. Fearing a break out, soldiers shoot down a crowd of internees waiting upon food delivery.
Conditions degenerate further, as an armed clique gains control over food deliveries, subjugating their fellow internees and exposing them to rape and deprivation. Faced with starvation, internees do battle and burn down the asylum, only to find that the army has abandoned the asylum, after which the protagonists join the throngs of nearly helpless blind people outside who wander the devastated city and fight one another to survive.
The story then follows the doctor and his wife and their impromptu “family” as they attempt to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who still sees (though she must hide this fact at first). The breakdown of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find each other. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food; violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.
There are many hints that the novel is an allegory about spiritual blindness and about humanity's lack of compassion for strangers.

[edit] Style





This article may contain original research or unverified claims. Please improve the article by adding references. See the talk page for details. (September 2008)


Like most works by Saramago, the novel is written in long sentences, with scant punctuation. Sentences can be half a page long and occasionally longer, and the lack of quotation marks around dialogue means it is not always possible to tell who is speaking.
Also typical of Saramago, rather than names the characters are referred to by descriptive appellations such as "the doctor's wife", "the car thief", or "the girl with the dark glasses". Given the blindness they face, some of these names are sharply ironic ("the boy with the squint"), as is perhaps the fact that the doctor is an eye doctor. The city afflicted by the blindness is itself never named nor the country specified, and there are few definite identifiers of culture, such as present-day technology. This contributes an element of timelessness as well as universality to the novel. The few definite identifiers of culture portrayed may hint that the country is Saramago's homeland of Portugal; the main character is shown eating chouriço, a spicy sausage, and some dialogue uses the familiar 'tu' second-person singular verb form (a distinction which does not exist in English, but does in Portuguese). The lack of proper nouns is a feature in many of Saramago's novels (e.g. All the Names or The Cave).

[edit] Connections

Saramago wrote a sequel to Blindness in 2004, titled Seeing (Ensaio sobre a lucidez, literal English translation Essay on lucidity). It was written in Portuguese and has been translated into English. The new novel takes place in the same unnamed country as the first one and features several of the same characters.


[edit] Film adaptation
Main article: Blindness (film)
An English-language film adaptation of the novel was directed by Fernando Meirelles. Filming began in July 2007 and stars Mark Ruffalo as the doctor and Julianne Moore as the doctor's wife. The film served as the opener of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.[1]

[edit] Criticism
Following the increased notoriety of the novel upon the release of the 2008 film adaptation, the US National Federation of the Blind (NFB) criticized Saramago's work. In a banquet speech at the organization’s annual convention on July 4, 2008, in Dallas, Texas, NFB President Dr. Marc Maurer criticized the novel and its film adaptation as negatively portraying the blind.[2]
