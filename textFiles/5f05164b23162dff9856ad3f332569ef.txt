if (wgNotice != '') document.writeln(wgNotice); List of terms relating to algorithms and data structures

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The NIST Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures is a reference work maintained by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. It defines a large number of terms relating to algorithms and data structures. For algorithms and data structures not necessarily mentioned here, see list of algorithms and list of data structures.
This list of terms was originally derived from the index of this document, and should be in the public domain, as it was compiled by a Federal Government employee as part of a Federal Government work. Some of the terms defined are:
