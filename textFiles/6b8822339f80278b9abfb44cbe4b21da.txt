From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Former American president George W. Bush is widely known to use nicknames to refer to journalists, fellow politicians, and members of his White House staff. His penchant for bestowing nicknames may come from his experiences with Skull & Bones, the Yale University secret society that gives every member a nickname. His was reportedly "Temporary", because he never chose a permanent one.[1]
Bush's nicknaming proclivity is noted enough to have attracted a variety of satire, including a New York Times humor piece,[2] and a Doonesbury strip where "Condi" is admonished with the phrase "Careful, Brown Sugar".
