This list provides a guide to the most important operas, as determined by their presence on a majority of compiled lists of significant operas: see the "Lists Consulted" section for full details. The operas listed cover all important genres, and include all operas regularly performed today, from seventeenth-century works by Monteverdi, Cavalli, and Purcell to late twentieth-century operas by Messiaen, Berio, Glass, Adams, Birtwistle, and Judith Weir. The brief accompanying notes offer an explanation as to why each opera has been considered important. For an introduction to operatic history, see Opera. The organisation of the list is by year of first performance, or, if this was long after the composer's death, approximate date of composition.

[edit] 1600–1699




Portrait of Claudio Monteverdi holding the mask of tragedy, painting by Domenico Fetti, 1640.



1607 L'Orfeo (Claudio Monteverdi). This is widely regarded as the first operatic masterwork.[1]
1640 Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (Claudio Monteverdi). Monteverdi's first opera for Venice, based on Homer's Odyssey, displays the composer's mastery of portrayal of genuine individuals as opposed to stereotypes.[2]
1642 L'incoronazione di Poppea (Claudio Monteverdi). Monteverdi's last opera, composed for a Venetian audience, is often performed today. Its Venetian context helps to explain the complete absence of the moralizing tone often associated with opera of this time.[2]
1644 Ormindo (Francesco Cavalli). One of the first of Cavalli's operas to be revived in the 20th century, Ormindo is considered one of his more attractive works.[2]
1649 Giasone (Francesco Cavalli). In Giasone Cavalli, for the first time, separated aria and recitative.[2]Giasone was the most popular opera of the 17th century.[3]
1651 La Calisto (Francesco Cavalli). The ninth of the eleven operas that Cavalli wrote with Faustini is noted for its satire of the deities of classical mythology.[4]
1683 Dido and Aeneas (Henry Purcell). Often considered to be the first genuine English-language operatic masterwork. Not first performed in 1689 at a girls' school, as is commonly believed, but at Charles II's court in 1683.[5]
1692 The Fairy-Queen (Henry Purcell). A semi-opera rather than a genuine opera, this is often thought to be Purcell's finest dramatic work.[5]


[edit] 1700–1749




George Frideric Handel. Painting by Balthasar Denner, 1733.



1710 Agrippina (George Frideric Handel). Handel's last opera that he composed in Italy was a great success,[6] and established his reputation as a composer of Italian opera. [7]
1711 Rinaldo (George Frideric Handel). Handel's first opera for the London stage was also the first all-Italian opera performed on the London stage.[7]
1724 Giulio Cesare (George Frideric Handel). This Handel opera is noted for the richness of its orchestration.[7]
1724 Tamerlano (George Frideric Handel). This work is described by Anthony Hicks, writing in Grove Music Online, as possessing a "taut dramatic power". [7]
1725 Rodelinda (George Frideric Handel). Rodelinda is often praised for the fullness of the melodic writing among Handel's output.[7]
1728 The Beggar's Opera (Johann Christoph Pepusch). A satire of Italian opera seria based on a play by John Gay, the ballad opera format of The Beggar's Opera has proved popular even up to the current time.[8]
1731 Acis and Galatea (George Frideric Handel). This is Handel's only work for the theatre that is set to an English libretto.[9]
1733 Orlando (George Frideric Handel). An opera that is described by Anthony Hicks as "remarkable" [7] and by Orrey as one of Handel's "best works".[9]
1733 La serva padrona (Giovanni Battista Pergolesi). La serva padrona became a model for many of the opera buffas that followed it, including those of Mozart.[10]
1733 Hippolyte et Aricie (Jean-Philippe Rameau). Rameau's first opera caused great controversy at its premiere.[11]
1735 Ariodante (George Frideric Handel). Both this opera and Alcina enjoy high critical reputations today.[7]
1735 Alcina (George Frideric Handel). Both this work and Ariodante were part of Handel's first opera season at Covent Garden.[7]
1735 Les Indes galantes (Jean-Philippe Rameau). In this work Rameau added emotional depth and power to the traditionally lighter form of opera-ballet.[11]
1737 Castor et Pollux (Jean-Philippe Rameau). Initially only a moderate success, when it was revived in 1754 Castor et Pollux was regarded as Rameau's finest achievement.[11]
1738 Serse (George Frideric Handel). A deviation from the usual model of opera seria, Serse contains many comic elements rare in Handel's other works.[7]
1744 Semele (George Frideric Handel). Originally performed as an oratorio, Semele's dramatic qualities have often lead to the work being performed on the opera stage in modern times.[12]
1745 Platée (Jean-Philippe Rameau). Rameau's most famous comic opera. Originally a court entertainment, a 1754 revival proved extremely popular with French audiences.[11]


[edit] 1750–1799




Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart aged 21 in 1777.



1760 La buona figliuola (Niccolò Piccinni). Piccinni's work was initially immensely popular throughout Europe. By 1790 over 70 productions of the opera had been produced and it had been performed in all the major European cities.[13]
1762 Orfeo ed Euridice (Christoph Willibald Gluck). Gluck's most popular opera. The first work in which the composer tried to reform the excesses of Italian opera seria.[14]
1767 Alceste (Christoph Willibald Gluck). Gluck's second "reform" opera, nowadays usually given in its French revision of 1776.[15]
1768 Bastien und Bastienne (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). Mozart's one-act Singspiel was set to a parody of Rousseau's Le Devin du Village.[16]
1770 Mitridate, re di Ponto (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). Composed when Mozart was 14, Mitridate was written for a demanding cast of star singers and is over 6 hours long in production.[16]
1772 Lucio Silla (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). This opera from Mozart's teenage years was not revived until 1929 after its initial run of 25 performances.[16]
1774 Iphigénie en Aulide (Christoph Willibald Gluck). Gluck's first opera for Paris.[17]
1775 La finta giardiniera (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). This work is generally recognised as Mozart's first opera buffa of significance.[16]
1775 Il re pastore (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). Mozart's last opera of his adolescence was set to a libretto by Pietro Metastasio.[16]
1777 Il mondo della luna (Joseph Haydn). This opera was the last of three that Haydn set to libretti by Carlo Goldoni.[18]
1777 Armide (Christoph Willibald Gluck). Gluck used a libretto originally set by Lully for this French work, his favourite among his own operas.[19]
1779 Iphigénie en Tauride (Christoph Willibald Gluck). Gluck's "last and perhaps greatest masterpiece".[20]
1781 Idomeneo (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). Usually thought of as Mozart's first mature opera, Idomeneo was composed after a lengthy break from the stage.[21]
1782 Die Entführung aus dem Serail (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). Often thought of as the first of Mozart's comic masterpieces, this work is frequently performed today.[22]
1782 Il barbiere di Siviglia (Giovanni Paisiello). Paisiello's most famous comic opera, later eclipsed by Rossini's work of the same name.[23]
1786 Der Schauspieldirektor (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). Another Singspiel with much spoken dialogue taken from plays of that time, the plot of Der Schauspieldirektor features two sopranos vying to become prima donna in a newly-assembled company. Premiered together with Antonio Salieri's Prima la musica, poi le parole [16]
1786 Le nozze di Figaro (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). The first of the famous series of Mozart operas set to libretti by Lorenzo Da Ponte is now Mozart's most popular opera.[16]
1787 Don Giovanni (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). The second of the operas that Mozart set to Da Ponte's libretti, Don Giovanni has provided a puzzle for writers and philosophers ever since its composition.[16]
1790 Così fan tutte (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). The third and last of the operas that Mozart set to libretti by Da Ponte, Così fan tutte was scarcely performed throughout the 19th century, as the plot was considered to be immoral.[24]
1791 La clemenza di Tito (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). Mozart's last opera before his early death was extremely popular until 1830, after which the work's popularity and critical reputation began to decline; they did not return to their former levels until after the Second World War.[16]
1791 Die Zauberflöte (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart). A work that has been described as "the apotheosis of the Singspiel", Die Zauberflöte was denigrated during the 19th century as confused and lacking in definition.[25]
1792 Il matrimonio segreto (Domenico Cimarosa). Usually regarded as Cimarosa's best opera,[26] Leopold II enjoyed the three-hour-long premiere so much that, after dinner, he compelled the singers to repeat the opera later during that same day.[27]
1797 Médée (Luigi Cherubini). The only French opera of the Revolutionary period to be regularly performed today. A famous showcase for sopranos such as Maria Callas.[28]


[edit] 1800–1832




A portrait of Rossini



1805 Fidelio (Ludwig van Beethoven). Beethoven's only opera was inspired by the composer's passion for political liberty. [29]
1807 La vestale (Gaspare Spontini). Spontini's opera about a vestal virgin in love was a great influence on Berlioz and a forerunner of French grand opera.[30]
1812 La scala di seta (Gioacchino Rossini). An early Rossini work, this opera is outright farsa comica.[31]
1813 L'italiana in Algeri (Gioacchino Rossini). This opera is described by Richard Osborne, writing in Grove Music Online, as "Rossini's first buffo masterpiece in the fully fledged two-act form".[31]
1813 Tancredi (Gioacchino Rossini). This melodramma eroico was described by poet Giuseppe Carpani thus: "It is cantilena and always cantilena: beautiful cantilena, new cantilena, magic cantilena, rare cantilena".[31]
1814 Il turco in Italia (Gioacchino Rossini). This opera stands out among Rossini's output for its frequent ensembles and absence of aria.[31]
1816 Il barbiere di Siviglia (Gioacchino Rossini). This work has become Rossini's most popular opera buffa.[31]
1816 Otello (Gioacchino Rossini). The composer Giacomo Meyerbeer described the third act of Otello thus: "The third act of Otello established its reputation so firmly that a thousand errors could not shake it".[31]
1817 La Cenerentola (Gioacchino Rossini). Rossini's comedy was composed in just over three weeks.[31]
1817 La gazza ladra (Gioacchino Rossini). In this opera Rossini drew upon the French genre of rescue opera.[31]

1821 Der Freischütz (Carl Maria von Weber). Weber's masterpiece was the first great German Romantic opera.[32]

1823 Semiramide (Gioacchino Rossini). This is the last opera that Rossini composed in Italy.[31]

1827 Il pirata (Vincenzo Bellini). Bellini's second professional production established his international reputation.[36]
1828 Der Vampyr (Heinrich Marschner). Marschner was a key link between Weber and Wagner, as this Gothic opera shows.[37]
1828 Le comte Ory (Gioacchino Rossini). Rossini's opera has enjoyed a high critical reputation throughout the years: 19th-century critic Henry Chorley said that "there is not a bad melody, there is not an ugly bar in Le comte Ory", and Richard Osborne, writing in Grove Music Online, calls details that the work is one of the "wittiest, most stylish and most urbane of all comic operas".[31]
1829 La straniera (Vincenzo Bellini). La straniera is rare among bel canto operas in that it offers remarkably few opportunities for vocal ostentation.[36]
1829 William Tell (Gioacchino Rossini). Rossini's last opera before his retirement is a tale of liberty set in the Swiss Alps. It helped to establish the genre of French grand opera.[38]
1830 Anna Bolena (Gaetano Donizetti). This was Donizetti's first success on the international scene and helped greatly to establish his reputation.[39]
1830 Fra Diavolo (Daniel Auber). One of the most popular opéra comiques of the 19th century, Auber's tale of a Neapolitan bandit even inspired a film by Laurel and Hardy.[40]
1830 I Capuleti e i Montecchi (Vincenzo Bellini). Bellini's version of Romeo and Juliet.[41]

1835 Das Liebesverbot (Richard Wagner) An early work by Wagner loosely based on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure. The composer later disowned it.[49]

1837 Roberto Devereux (Gaetano Donizetti) Donizetti wrote this work as a distraction from the grief he felt at the death of his wife.[55]

1846 The Damnation of Faust (Hector Berlioz) Frustrated at his lack of opera commissions, Berlioz composed this "dramatic legend" for concert performance. In recent years, it has been successfully staged as an opera, though the critic David Cairns describes it as "cinematic".[70]
1847 Macbeth (Giuseppe Verdi) Verdi's first venture into Shakespeare.[69]
1847 Martha (Friedrich von Flotow) Flotow unashamedly aimed at satisfying popular taste in this comic and sentimental work set in the England of Queen Anne.[71]

1849 Le prophète (Giacomo Meyerbeer) A grand opera about the life of the religious fanatic, John of Leiden.[73]

[edit] 1850–1875




Richard Wagner



1850 Genoveva (Robert Schumann) Schumann's only excursion into opera was a relative failure, though the work has had its admirers from Liszt to Nikolaus Harnoncourt. [75]
1850 Lohengrin (Richard Wagner)The last of Wagner's "middle period" works.[76]
1850 Stiffelio (Giuseppe Verdi) Verdi's tale of adultery among members of an American Protestant sect fell foul of the censors.[77]
1851 Rigoletto (Giuseppe Verdi) The first - and most innovative- of three middle period Verdi operas which have become staples of the repertoire.[78]
1853 Il trovatore (Giuseppe Verdi) This Romantic melodrama is one of Verdi's most tuneful scores.[79]

1855 Les vêpres siciliennes (Giuseppe Verdi) Verdi's opera displays the strong influence of Meyerbeer.[81]
1858 Der Barbier von Bagdad (Peter Cornelius) An oriental comedy drawing on the tradition of German Romantic opera.[82]
1858 Orphée aux enfers (Jacques Offenbach) The world's first operetta, this cynical and satirical piece is still immensely popular today. [83]
1858 Les Troyens (Hector Berlioz) Berlioz's greatest opera and the culmination of the French Classical tradition.[70]
1859 Faust (Charles Gounod) Of all the musical settings of the Faust legend, Gounod's has been the most popular with audiences, especially in the Victorian era.[84]
1859 Un ballo in maschera (Giuseppe Verdi) By the time he came to write Un ballo in maschera, Verdi was rich enough not to have to work for a living. This opera ran into trouble with the censors because it originally dealt with the assassination of a monarch.[85]
1862 Béatrice et Bénédict (Hector Berlioz) The last opera Berlioz wrote is the fruit of his lifelong admiration for Shakespeare.[86]
1862 La forza del destino (Giuseppe Verdi) This tragedy was commissioned by the Imperial Theatre, Saint Petersburg, and Verdi may have been influenced by the Russian tradition in the writing of his work.[87]
1863 Les pêcheurs de perles (Georges Bizet) Though a relative failure at its premiere, this is Bizet's second most performed opera today and is particularly famous for its tenor/baritone duet.[88]
1864 La belle Hélène (Jacques Offenbach) Another operetta by Offenbach which pokes fun at Greek mythology.[89]
1864 Mireille (Charles Gounod) Gounod's work is based on the epic poem by Frédéric Mistral and makes use of Provençal folk tunes.[90]
1865 L'Africaine (Giacomo Meyerbeer) Meyerbeer's last grand opera received a posthumous premiere.[91]
1865 Tristan und Isolde (Richard Wagner) This romantic tragedy is Wagner's most radical work and one of the most revolutionary pieces in music history. The "Tristan chord" began the breakdown of traditional tonality.[92]
1866 Mignon (Ambroise Thomas) A lyrical work inspired by Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister, this was Thomas's most successful opera along with Hamlet.[93]
1866 The Bartered Bride (Bedřich Smetana) Smetana's folk comedy is the most widely performed of all his operas.[94]
1867 Don Carlos (Giuseppe Verdi) Verdi's take on French grand opera is now one of his most highly regarded works.[95]
1867 La jolie fille de Perth (Georges Bizet) Bizet turned to a novel by Sir Walter Scott for this opéra comique.[96]
1867 Roméo et Juliette (Charles Gounod) Gounod's version of Shakespeare's tragedy is his second most famous work.[97]
1868 Dalibor (Bedřich Smetana) One of the most successful of Smetana's operas exploring themes from Czech history.[98]
1868 Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (Richard Wagner) Wagner's only comedy among his mature operas concerns the clash between artistic tradition and innovation.[99]
1868 Hamlet (Ambroise Thomas) Thomas's opera takes many liberties with its Shakespearean source.[100]
1868 La Périchole (Jacques Offenbach) Set in Peru, this operetta mixes comedy and sentimentality.[101]
1868 Mefistofele (Arrigo Boito) Though most famous as a librettist for Verdi, Boito was also a composer and he spent many years working on this musical version of the Faust myth.[102]
1869 Das Rheingold (Richard Wagner) The "preliminary evening" to Wagner's epic Ring cycle tells how the ring was forged and the curse laid upon it.[103]

1871 Aida (Giuseppe Verdi)
1874 Boris Godunov (Modest Mussorgsky) Mussorgsky's great historical drama shows Russia's descent into anarchy in the early 17th century.[105]
1874 Die Fledermaus (Johann Strauss II) Probably the most popular of all operettas.[106]
1874 The Two Widows (Bedřich Smetana) Another comedy by Smetana, the only one of his operas with a non-Czech subject.[107]
1875 Carmen (Georges Bizet) Probably the most famous of all French operas. Critics at the premiere were shocked by Bizet's blend of romanticism and realism.[108]


[edit] 1876–1899




Giuseppe Verdi, the celebrated portrait by Giovanni Boldini, 1886 (National Gallery of Modern Art, Rome).



1876 Siegfried (Richard Wagner) The third part of the Ring sees the hero Siegfried slay the dragon Fafner, win the ring and free Brunhilde from her enchantment.[109]

1877 L'étoile (Emmanuel Chabrier) This comic piece has been described as "a cross between Carmen and Gilbert and Sullivan, with plenty of Offenbach thrown in".[111]
1877 Samson and Delilah (Camille Saint-Saëns). An opera with that was heavily influenced by those of Wagner.[112]
1879 Eugene Onegin (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky) Tchaikovsky's most popular opera, based on the verse novel by Pushkin. The composer strongly identified with the heroine Tatyana.[113]
1881 Hérodiade (Jules Massenet) An opera telling the Biblical story of Salome, Massenet's work was eclipsed by Richard Strauss's treatment of the same subject.[114]
1881 Les contes d'Hoffmann (Jacques Offenbach) Offenbach's attempt at writing a more serious work remained unfinished at his death. Nevertheless, this is his most widely performed opera today.[101]
1881 Simon Boccanegra (Giuseppe Verdi). Verdi heavily revised this opera over twenty years after it was first performed.[60]
1882 Parsifal (Richard Wagner) Wagner's last opera is a "festival play" about the legend of the Holy Grail.[115]

1888 Le roi d'Ys (Édouard Lalo) A Breton folk tale with music heavily influenced by Wagner.[123]
