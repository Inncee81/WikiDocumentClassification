[edit] Gross federal debt
This table lists the gross federal debt[1] as a percent of GDP by Presidential term since World War II.[2] It is currently the highest since 1955. For net jobs changes, see Jobs created during U.S. presidential terms. The elected representatives of the United States share responsibility for making the decisions which bring about changes in the national debt. All spending bills start in the House of Representatives. It should be noted that often the sitting President faces an opposition Congress.[3]

[edit] Public debt
It is important to note the difference between the fiscal terms gross debt and public debt. In brief, the public debt is the gross debt less the amount the government owes itself. The figure below shows the trend in public debt with the background colored by the party controlling the executive.





Time series of U.S. public debt overlaid with partisan affiliation of the White House. The top frame gives the public debt in trillions of USD and the bottom normalizes that by GDP. (Data is from the 2009 U.S. Budget)




[edit] Federal spending, federal debt, and GDP
The below table shows the annual federal spending, gross federal debt, and gross domestic product for average presidential parties, specific presidential terms, and specific fiscal years.[4]
