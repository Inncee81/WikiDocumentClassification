The ability to accurately estimate the time and/or cost taken for a project to come in to its successful conclusion is a serious problem for software engineers. The use of a repeatable, clearly defined and well understood software development process has, in recent years, shown itself to be the most effective method of gaining useful historical data that can be used for statistical estimation. In particular, the act of sampling more frequently, coupled with the loosening of constraints between parts of a project, has allowed more accurate estimation and more rapid development times.

[edit] Methods
Popular methods for estimation in software engineering include:

Parametric Estimating
Wideband Delphi
COCOMO
SLIM
SEER-SEM Parametric Estimation of Effort, Schedule, Cost, Risk. Mimimum time and staffing concepts based on Brooks's law
Function Point Analysis
Proxy-based estimating (PROBE) (from the Personal Software Process)
The Planning Game (from Extreme Programming)
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
Analysis Effort method
TruePlanning Software Model Parametric model that estimates the scope, cost, effort and schedule for software projects.
Evidence-based Scheduling Refinement of typical agile estimating techniques using minimal measurement and total time accounting.
