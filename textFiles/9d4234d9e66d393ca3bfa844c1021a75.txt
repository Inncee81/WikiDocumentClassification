Artist Trading Cards (or ATCs) are miniature works of art about the same size as baseball cards[1] and thin enough to fit inside standard card-collector pockets, sleeves or sheets.[2] The ATC movement developed out of the mail art movement and has its origin in Switzerland.[3] The cards are usually traded or exchanged rather than sold.

[edit] History
M. Vänçi Stirnemann originated the idea in 1996,[4] holding trading sessions in Zurich, Switzerland.
Clubs and trading sessions have largely replaced the original concept of trading the cards during individual encounters, and many ATC workshops end with a trading session[5]

[edit] ACEO: Art card, editions and originals
An offshoot of Artist Trading Cards are the "Art Cards, Editions, and Originals" (ACEO). ACEOs originated when some artists began to create cards to sell, in addition to trading among themselves.
As one example, Michael Leavitt (artist) specifically designed his Art Cards (2001-03) to be appreciated as originals unto themselves. His hand-painted small portraits of artists replicated traditional baseball trading cards in style and format.[6] ArtCard subjects were drawn from varied genre, with icons such as Vincent Van Gogh, David Byrne, Bob Ross, Frida Kahlo, Jackson Pollock, Laurie Anderson, Björk, and Michael Jackson. The limited editions were hand-packed in wrappers with bubble gum, as Art Cards were sold personally by Leavitt and exhibited as art objects. [7][8] Leavitt said, "It's a way I created to compare people and what they do across all kinds of different areas." [9]
