The Elements of Typographic Style is a book by Canadian typographer, poet and translator Robert Bringhurst. Originally published in 1992, it was revised in 1996, 2001 (v2.4), 2002 (v2.5), 2004 (v3.0), and 2005 (v3.1). A history and guide to typography, it has been praised by Hermann Zapf, who said “I wish to see this book become the Typographers’ Bible.”[1] Because of its widespread use, it is sometimes abbreviated simply as Bringhurst.
The title alludes to The Elements of Style.
