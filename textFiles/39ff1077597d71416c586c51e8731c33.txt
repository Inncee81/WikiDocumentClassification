[edit] Biography
Misrach graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971. Where he learned photography is unknown. However, he first started photographing with a 35 mm camera with the intent of fostering social change. Since the late 1970s he has photographed using an 8x10 camera and color film. Richard Misrach lives in Berkeley, Cal nia

[edit] Photography career
Misrach has been photographing the American desert for more than twenty years now. He has a unique gift of photographing a complex landscape and exposing the mysterious and captivating surroundings.

[edit] Style
Misrach’s photographs are not taken for a political reason but issues are attached only after published. When taking photographs of a specific site Misrach thinks of them as being similar to history paintings rather than journalistic photos.

[edit] Theme
Misrach has two specific themes the surround all his works. until the “On the Beach” canto Misrach never cropped or digitally enhanced his photographs. For ninety percent of Misrach’s work he used an 8 by 10 camera. The only exception was his trilogy of “Jungles in Hawaii”, “Swamps of Louisiana”, and the “Gardens of Los Angeles” when he created thirty by forty photographs. When staging photos he will also use spotlights and reduces distance to a two and a quarter square format. [1]
