MARC is an acronym, used in the field of library science, that stands for MAchine-Readable Cataloging. The MARC standards consist of the MARC formats, which are standards for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form, and related documentation. It defines a bibliographic data format that was developed by Henriette Avram at the Library of Congress beginning in the 1960s. It provides the protocol by which computers exchange, use, and interpret bibliographic information. Its data elements make up the foundation of most library catalogs used today.
The record structure of MARC is an implementation of ISO 2709, also known as ANSI/NISO Z39.2.[1] MARC records are composed of three elements: the record structure, the content designation, and the data content of the record. The record structure implements national and international standards (e.g., Z39.2, ISO2709). The content designation is "the codes and conventions established to identify explicitly and characterize ... data elements within a record"[1] and support their manipulation. The content of data elements in MARC records is defined by standards outside the formats such as AACR2, L.C. Subject Headings, and MeSH.[2]
The future of the MARC formats is a matter of some debate in the worldwide library science community. On the one hand, the storage formats are quite complex and are based on outdated technology. On the other, there is no alternative bibliographic format with an equivalent degree of granularity. The huge user base, billions of records in tens of thousands of individual libraries (including over 50,000,000 belonging to the OCLC consortium alone), also creates inertia. (See also the concept of Path dependence.)

[edit] MARC formats
Authority records — MARC authority records provide information about individual names, subjects, and uniform titles. An authority record establishes an authorized form of each heading, with references as appropriate from other forms of the heading.
Bibliographic records — MARC bibliographic records describe the intellectual and physical characteristics of bibliographic resources (books, sound recordings, video recordings, and so forth).
Classification records — MARC records containing classification data. For example, the Library of Congress Classification has been encoded using the MARC 21 Classification format.
Community Information records — MARC records describing a service providing agency. For example, the local homeless shelter or tax assistance provider.
Holdings records — MARC holdings records provide copy-specific information on a library resource (call number, shelf location, volumes held, and so forth).

[edit] MARC 21
MARC 21 is a result of the combination of the United States and Canadian MARC formats (USMARC and CAN/MARC). MARC21 is based on the ANSI standard Z39.2, which allows users of different software products to communicate with each other and to exchange data.[3] MARC 21 was designed to redefine the original MARC record format for the 21st century and to make it more accessible to the international community. MARC 21 has formats for the following five types of data: Bibliographic Format, Authority Format, Holdings Format, Community Format, and Classification Data Format.[3] Currently MARC 21 has been implemented successfully by The British Library, the European Institutions and the major library institutions in the United States, and Canada.
MARC 21 allows the use of two character sets, either MARC-8 or Unicode encoded as UTF-8. MARC-8 is based on ISO 2022 and allows the use of Hebrew, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, and East Asian scripts. MARC 21 in UTF-8 format allows all the languages supported by Unicode.

[edit] MARC variants
There are many national and international variants of MARC, including

MARC 21: the "harmonization" of USMARC and CAN/MARC; it is maintained by the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress.
AUSMARC: national MARC of Australia, published by the National Library of Australia in 1973; USMARC adopted in 1991
BIBSYS-MARC: used by all Norwegian University Libraries, the National Library, all college libraries, and a number of research libraries.
NORMARC: national MARC of Norway, based on MARC21
danMARC2: national MARC of Denmark, based on MARC21
FINMARC: national MARC of Finland
SWEMARC: national MARC of Sweden
INTERMARC: MARC used by Bibliothèque nationale de France
UNIMARC: created by IFLA in 1977, it is the official MARC in France, Italy, Russia, Portugal, Greece and other countries.
CMARC: national MARC of the Republic of China(Taiwan), based on UNIMARC
KORMARC: national MARC of South Korea, KS X 6006
MARCBN: national MARC of Poland, based on MARC21
IDSMARC: (inter)national MARC of Swiss German University Libraries, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, based on MARC21

MARC 21 is not a new format. The original American version of MARC became known as USMARC in the 1980s; there was also a separate Canadian version with minor differences called CAN/MARC. After making minor changes to both formats, the USMARC and CAN/MARC specifications were merged in 1997 to create MARC 21,[4] the name intended to reflect the 21st century. The British Library has announced that it will no longer develop the UKMARC standard it had maintained since 1975 and will instead adopt MARC 21.
In Germany a non-MARC format called MAB (Maschinelles Austauschformat für Bibliotheken) is used.
