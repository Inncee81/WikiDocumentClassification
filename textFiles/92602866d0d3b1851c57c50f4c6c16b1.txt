An Internet media type,[1] originally called a MIME type after MIME and sometimes a Content-type after the name of a header in several protocols whose value is such a type, is a two-part identifier for file formats on the Internet. The identifiers were originally defined in RFC 2046 for use in e-mail sent through SMTP, but their use has expanded to other protocols such as HTTP and SIP.
A media type is composed of at least two parts: a type, a subtype, and one or more optional parameters. For example, subtypes of text type have an optional charset parameter that can be included to indicate the character encoding, and subtypes of multipart type often define a boundary between parts.
Types or subtypes that begin with "x-" are nonstandard -- they cannot be registered with IANA.[2] Subtypes that begin with vnd. are vendor-specific; subtypes in the personal or vanity tree begin with prs..[3]

[edit] List of common media types
IANA manages a registry of media types and character encodings. The organization makes a list available to the public through the Web. Some of the more notable media types used on the Web are listed below:

Type application: Multipurpose files

application/EDI-X12: EDI X12 data; Defined in RFC 1767
application/EDIFACT: EDI EDIFACT data; Defined in RFC 1767
application/javascript: JavaScript; Defined in RFC 4329
application/octet-stream: Arbitrary octet stream. This is thought of as the "default" media type used by several operating systems, often used to identify executable files, files of unknown type, or files that should be downloaded in protocols that do not provide a separate "content disposition" header. RFC 2046 specifies this as the fallback for unrecognized subtypes of other types.
application/ogg: Ogg, a multimedia bitstream container format; Defined in RFC 3534
application/pdf: Portable Document Format, PDF has been in use for document exchange on the Internet since 1993; Defined in RFC 3778
application/xhtml+xml: XHTML; Defined by RFC 3236
application/xml-dtd: DTD files; Defined by RFC 3023
application/json: JavaScript Object Notation JSON; Defined in RFC 4627
application/zip: ZIP archive files; Registered[4]


Type audio: Audio

audio/mpeg: MP3 or other MPEG audio; Defined in RFC 3003
audio/x-ms-wma: Windows Media Audio; Documented in Microsoft KB 288102

audio/x-wav: WAV audio


Type example
Type image

image/gif: GIF image; Defined in RFC 2045 and RFC 2046
image/jpeg: JPEG JFIF image; Defined in RFC 2045 and RFC 2046

image/svg+xml: SVG vector image; Defined in RFC 3023
image/tiff: Tag Image File Format; Defined in RFC 3302
image/vnd.microsoft.icon: ICO image; Registered[6]


Type message

message/http


Type model: 3D models
Type multipart: Archives and other objects made of more than one part
