Geoffrey Moore is a Silicon Valley based high technology consultant and author.
His books are derived from his Silicon Valley consulting work at The McKenna Group and The Chasm Group (which he founded), and earlier work by Everett Rogers on adopter categories and diffusion of innovations.
Looking at the technology adoption lifecycle (innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards), the focus is on adopter categories.
Moore's key insight is that the groups adopt innovations for different reasons. Early adopters are technology enthusiasts looking for a radical shift, where the early majority wants a "productivity improvement". The latter group want a whole product, where the earlier group only needs the core product, and has the technical competence, and financial resources to make the rest themselves.
One of Moore's most important theories is that of the metaphorical Bowling Alley as it applies to product development and rollout, after the Chasm.
