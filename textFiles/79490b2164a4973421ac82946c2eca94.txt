Xapian is an open source probabilistic information retrieval library, released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). That is, it is a full text search engine library for programmers.
It is written in C++, with bindings to allow use from Perl, Python, PHP, Java, Tcl, C#, and Ruby. Xapian is highly portable and runs on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, Tru64, IRIX, and Microsoft Windows.
Xapian is designed to be a highly adaptable toolkit to allow developers to easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications.
A growing number of organisations and projects are known to be using Xapian including Debian, Gmane, Die Zeit, Delicious, MoinMoin, and One Laptop per Child.[1]

[edit] Features

Transactions: if database update fails in the middle of a transaction, the database is guaranteed to remain in a consistent state.
Simultaneous search and update, with new documents being immediately visible.
Support for large databases: Xapian has been proven to be scalable to hundreds of millions of documents.
Accurate probabilistic ranking: more relevant documents are listed first.
Phrase and proximity searching.
Relevance feedback, which improves ranking and can expand a query, find related documents, categorise documents etc.
Structured Boolean queries, e.g. "race AND condition NOT horse"
Wildcard search, e.g. "wiki*"
Spelling correction
Omega, a packaged solution for adding a search engine to a web site or intranet. Omega can easily be extended and adapted to fit changing requirements.
