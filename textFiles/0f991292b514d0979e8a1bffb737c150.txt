It was originally created in September 2006 by Boštjan Čadež (also known as "fšk"), a Slovenian university student.[1][2] Originally appearing on DeviantArt on September 23 2006, Line Rider quickly became an internet phenomenon. Line Rider has also been seen in McDonald's Commercials.
Line Rider has been featured by several websites, such as Yahoo! but is mainly used on the website Linerider.com. [3], and Time Magazine's website.[4] Line Rider was also selected by staff and voted by users as the Best Webtoy of 2006 in the Jay is Games polls.[5] A two-page article about the game was published in Games for Windows: The Official Magazine.[6]

The Line Rider character, "Bosh"


The basic concept is to draw one or more lines with the mouse on which a boy (referred to as "Bosh" by the creator[7]) on a sled can ride after the player presses the "Play" button. The game includes simulated physics, which means the track must be sufficiently smooth to prevent the character from falling off the sled. The author has said that he prefers the description "toy" to "game," as there is no goal to accomplish, nor does it have an end.[8] In spite of its simplicity, many complicated tracks have been created, which include loops and other stunts. New tracks can consist of unrealistic tricks such as "flings" and "manuals" both on and off the sled. Some tracks are even set to music and include hand-drawn scenery such as mountain slopes and trees. Tracks are typically shared among users by uploading a video to web sites, such as YouTube or Google Video.[9] Revision 6.2 of Line Rider was released in August 2007, and was optimized to run more smoothly, and to have a higher-powered zoom tool. The game does allow created tracks to be saved, and shown to the public (only if creator wishes to do so). The storage is not on the line rider website, but on the user's hard drive, therefore allowing maximum storage implication and quicker access to stored tracks. In order to allow public viewing, the user must be logged into the website server.
A new version of the game has beeen released,to buy. This version includes a much larger tool base for creating scenery, the ability to include some colors and layers, stunts and sound. The new version also allows for situations in which Bosh may be able to reacquire his sled if he falls off, and features a "finish line" which will prevent the track from going on forever. There will also be a number of new "line-types". New types of lines are the "trampoline lines," which cause Bosh to bounce against the line; "trapdoor lines," which are erased when Bosh rides over them; "slow lines," which slow down Bosh when riding; "trigger lines," which can either be used to zoom in on Bosh and/or make him do a trick, and "breakable lines," which allow Bosh to go through them and explode when they are touched. The "Trampoline lines" were used to make bouncers for the pinball track in TechDawg's alpha preview. The game has been referred to as "Line Rider 2: Unbound." This version is available for purchase on the personal computer, Nintendo DS and Wii, marking the first time the series has been released beyond the computer.
On July 1, 2008 the original Flash version was replaced by a new one written in Silverlight 2 Beta 2. It includes a new feature that allows people to send tracks to other people via Windows Messenger.

On December 19 2006, it was announced that InXile Entertainment had gained console rights for the game, legally restricting copies and imitations of the game. In fact, InXile Entertainment is currently threatening legal action against content providers who host versions of the original game. Nintendo DS and Wii versions were released in Fall 2008, containing new features.[10]
It has also been stated that a story mode featuring new characters Bailey and Chaz will be in the game for DS, PC and Wii. In the story mode the player will compete against Chaz in hopes of winning the ultimate sled and the love of Bailey. This mode will span 40 courses, all of which were designed by TechDawg, a well known track designer. You can also download other peoples' tracks off of the internet from the game's website. [11] The European version will be published by Koch Media.
It has been nominated for two Nintendo DS-specific awards in IGN's 2008 Game of the Year awards, namely Best Puzzle Game[12] and Best Original Score.[13]

[edit] Mobile version
Line Rider was released for portable devices in October 2008. Gameplay is similar to that of the original revision 6.2, with the addition of a multiplayer puzzle mode, and has several added features including different vehicles, exploding lines and scenery. Players are able to share tracks with others through a Bluetooth connection and can send the files in texts to other phones and to the web.[citation needed]
A version has been released for the Apple iPhone called Line Rider iRide.
