This article is about the chess move 'en passant'.  For other uses, see En passant (disambiguation).







This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.

En passant (from French: "in passing") is a move in the board game of chess. En passant is a special capture made immediately after a player moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position, and an opposing pawn could have captured it if it had moved only one square forward. In this situation, the opposing pawn may, on the immediately subsequent move, capture the pawn as if taking it "as it passes" through the first square; the resulting position would then be the same as if the pawn had only moved one square forward and the opposing pawn had captured normally. The en passant capture must be done on the very next turn, or the right to do so is lost.[1] Such a move is the only occasion in chess in which a piece captures but does not move to the square of the captured piece. If an en passant capture is the only legal move it must be made.
This rule was added in the 14th or 15th Century when the rule about pawns having the option of initially moving two squares was added. The rationale is so that a pawn can not pass by another pawn using the two-square move without the risk of it being captured.
In either algebraic or descriptive chess notation, en passant captures are sometimes denoted by "e.p." or similar, but such notation is not required. In algebraic notation, the move is written as if the captured pawn just advanced only one square, e.g, exf6 (or exf6 e.p.) in the illustration below.

Example of en passant


Black to move



























































































The black pawn is in its initial location. If it moves to f6 (×), the white pawn could capture it.




White to move



























































































Black moved his pawn forward two squares from f7 to f5, "passing" f6.





Black to move



























































































On the next move, White captures en passant, capturing the pawn as if it had moved to f6.







[edit] Threefold repetition and stalemate
When claiming a draw by threefold repetition, two positions whose pieces are all on the same squares, with the same player to move, are considered different if there was an opportunity to make an en passant capture in the first position, because that opportunity by definition no longer exists the second time the same configuration of pieces occurs.
Kenneth Harkness said that it is frequently asked if an en passant capture must be made if it is the only move to get out of stalemate. The answer is that it must be made (or resign) and it also must be made if it is the only move to get out of check (Harkness 1967:49).

[edit] Examples in the opening




























































































Petrov line, after 5... d7-d5, the white pawn on e5 may capture en passant.


In this line from the Petrov Defence, White can capture the pawn on d5 en passant on his sixth move.

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nf6
3. d4 exd4
4. e5 Ne4
5. Qxd4 d5 (diagram)
6. exd6 (Hooper & Whyld 1992:124-25).


Another example occurs in the French Defense after 1.e4 e6 2.e5, a move once advocated by Wilhelm Steinitz. If Black responds with 2...d5, White can capture the pawn en passant with 3.exd6.

[edit] Example from game
Gundersen-Faul, 1928



























































































Position after 12... f7-f5.


Gundersen-Faul



























































































After 14... g7-g5. White wins by taking the pawn en passant, which results in checkmate.



In this game [2] between Gunnar Gundersen and A. H. Faul, Black has just moved his pawn from f7 to f5. The white pawn on e5 could capture the f-pawn en passant, but White had a different idea:

13. h5+ Kh6
14. Nxe6+ g5
15. hxg6 e.p. #

Capturing the g-pawn en passant resulted in checkmate.


[edit] Historical context
Historically, allowing en passant is one of the last major rule changes in European chess that occurred in the 14th to 15th century, together with the introduction of the two-square first move for pawns, castling, and the unlimited range for queens and bishops. Because of their separation from European chess prior to that period, the Asian chess variants do not feature any of these moves.
The motivation for en passant was to prevent the newly-added two-square first move for pawns from allowing them to evade capture by an enemy pawn. Specifically, it should still allow pawns on the player's fifth rank the opportunity to capture a pawn on an adjacent file which advances two squares from its starting square.
