[edit] An Eclipse Application
XMind 3.0 is based on Eclipse Rich Client Platform 3.4 for its shell and Eclipse Graphical Editing Framework for its core editors. It depends on Java Runtime Environment 5.0 and later.

[edit] File Format
XMind 3.0 describes its file format as XMIND Workbook (.xmind)(Or .xmap for XMIND 2008). A workbook may contain more than one sheet, as in Microsoft Excel. Each sheet may contain multiple topics, including one central topic, multiple main topics and multiple floating topics. Each sheet contains one mind map or fishbone chart. XMind Workbook (a .xmind file) consists of a ZIP compressed archive containing an XML document for contents, an XML document for styles, a .png image file for thumbnails, and some directories for like attachments. The file format is open and based on some principles of OpenDocument.
