Farbrausch, or Farb-rausch, is a German group of demomakers who made themselves particularly famous in the demoscene in December 2000 with a 64kB intro called "fr-08: .the .product". "Farbrausch" literally translates to "rave of color", "color rush" or "color frenzy" in English.
Using techniques like procedural textures, scenes and animations together with a high-quality software synthesizer, ".the .product" is an 11-minute 3-D show featuring complex scenes which opened a new era in demo making, showing that CPU power and mass storage are not a substitute to the creative human brain. This is an achievement since most demos created in the 21st century tend to focus much more on the aesthetic rather than optimization skills and number crunching. Farbrausch introduced the idea that you can still do both in the modern computer age.
Their work has won numerous awards, and their name a good degree of fame. In 2004, a subdivision of farbrausch called ".theprodukkt" released a 96kB first-person shooter game named ".kkrieger", and an earlier version of the tool they currently use to produce some of their demos, named ".werkkzeug", or "Tool".
Farbrausch is known for giving all of their releases a "product code", in the format "fr-0#". The numbers do not specify the order of release — the members have stated that they allocate the numbers as they start working on the project, not when they finish it. They give "minus" numbers to their non-serious releases.
Since then they have periodically released ever-improving compositions such as "fr-019: Poem to a Horse", "fr-030: Candytron" or "fr-025: The.Popular.Demo". Both The.Popular.Demo and debris. are one of the most highly favored demos on the comprehensive demoscene index, Pouet. The.Popular.Demo is also the recipient of the "Public Choice Award" from the 2003 scene.org awards [1], and debris. won the 2007 scene.org award for best direction [2].
