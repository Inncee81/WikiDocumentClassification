The iPod Touch (trademarked and marketed as iPod touch, but sometimes incorrectly referred to as iTouch) is a personal digital assistant, portable media player, and Wi-Fi mobile platform designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The product was launched on September 5, 2007 at an event called The Beat Goes On.[4] The iPod Touch adds the multi-touch graphical user interface to the iPod line and is available with 8, 16, or 32 GB of flash memory. It includes Apple's Safari web browser and is the first iPod with wireless access to the iTunes Store. With a software update, which is sold by Apple, it also has access to Apple's App Store.[5] The second generation iPod Touch, featuring external volume controls, a built-in speaker, a contoured back and built-in Nike+ support, was unveiled on September 9, 2008 at the Let's Rock keynote presentation.

[edit] Description
The iPod Touch has the iPhone's multi-touch interface, with a physical home button off the touch screen. The home screen has a list of buttons for the available applications. The iPod Touch is equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11b/g. All iPod Touch models include the applications Music, Videos, and Photos (collectively duplicating the standard functions of the iPod Classic), iTunes (providing access to the Wi-Fi Music Store), Safari, YouTube, Calendar, Contacts, Clock, Calculator, and Settings. Later models added Mail (accessing POP/IMAP/SMTP e-mail), Maps, Stocks, Notes, and Weather, which could also be added to the earlier models with the purchase of a software upgrade.[6] The user can add direct links to web sites (called "Web Clips") to the home screen.
On July 11, 2008 the iPhone 2.0 Software Update was released for purchase for the iPod Touch. The update allowed first generation iPod Touch devices to access the App Store, download third-party applications, in addition to a host of minor "fixes".

[edit] Comparisons to the iPhone and model comparisons
Further information: iPhone OS and iPhone OS version history
The iPod Touch and the iPhone share the same hardware platform and are controlled by the same iPhone OS operating system. The iPod Touch lacks some of the iPhone's features such as: access to a phone network, a built-in microphone, a camera, and GPS receiver; as a result, the iPod Touch is slimmer and lighter than the iPhone. Steve Jobs has referred to the iPod Touch as "training wheels for the iPhone".[8]
The second generation iPod Touch has an external volume switch and a built-in speaker, like the iPhone. The second generation also comes with the chrome frame seen on the iPhone 3G, making the two almost identical when viewed from the front. However, there are some notable differences, as there is no speaker above the screen, no silent/ringer switch, and the sleep/wake button is on the other side. The second generation also supports audio input when a headphone or earphone with microphone capabilities is plugged into the audio output jack. The iPod Touch 2.0 Software Update supports WPA2 Enterprise with 802.1X authentication.[9] Apple announced that the iPhone OS 3.0 update will unlock Bluetooth capability on the second generation iPod Touch, as the included Wi-Fi chip (Broadcom BCM4325) has Bluetooth and FM Radio support.[10][11]
Second generation iPod Touches are said to have a yellower cast/tint to the display, as compared to the iPhone or the original iPod Touch.[12] Claims have also been made that the applications processor inside the second generation iPod Touch runs faster than the processor inside the iPhone 3G.[13][14] The first generation iPod Touch works with all "Made for iPod" peripherals, but certain changes that Apple made to the second generation iPod Touch prevent some existing peripherals from recharging the updated player.[15] The Google Street View feature added on iPhone firmware version 2.2 is absent from the same version of firmware released on the iPod Touch.[16]

[edit] Requirements
As supplied new, the iPod Touch needs a connection to a computer for initial configuration.[17] Officially, Apple requires iTunes to be installed on either a Mac OS X or Windows operating system based computer for configuring the iPod Touch. On either operating system, the iPod Touch must be connected through a USB port.[18] The first time the iPod Touch is turned on, a "connect cable to iTunes" graphic will be displayed continuously until the iPod Touch is connected to a computer running iTunes.[19]
To use the iPod Touch for buying products at the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store via Wi-Fi, an iTunes Store account must be created in iTunes and the account details then entered into the iPod.[20]
Apple states that the following is required for the iPod Touch:[18]

A computer running either:

Mac OS X 10.4.10 or later
Microsoft Windows XP with SP2 or later, or Microsoft Windows Vista (32 or 64-bit versions)


iTunes 8.0 (with the 2.1 iPhone OS update) or 7.6 for iPhone OS 2.0.x or earlier
Available USB 2.0 port


[edit] Third-party applications




The App Store on an iPod Touch.






Jailbroken first generation iPod Touch in a red case, running iPhone OS version 1.1.1.


The only official way to obtain third-party applications for the iPod Touch is Apple's iTunes Store. The App Store application, available in all versions of the iPhone OS from version 2.0 (or Software Update 2.0) onwards, allows users to browse and download applications from an online repository with the iTunes Store. To develop such software, a software development kit (SDK) was officially announced on March 6, 2008, at an Apple Town Hall meeting.[21] The iPhone SDK allows developers to make applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch after paying a fee to join the development team. The developer can then set the price for the applications they develop and will receive 70% of the sale price. The developer can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any additional costs.
Shortly after the iPod Touch was released (iPhone OS version 1.1.1), hackers were able to "jailbreak" the device through a TIFF exploit. The resulting application, "Installer.app", enabled the user to download a selection of unofficial third-party programs. Some of these give the user more control over the iPod Touch than is officially available, and also makes it work on Linux operating systems. All subsequent versions of the iPhone OS can be jailbroken.[22] Servicing an iPod Touch after jailbreaking or other modifications made by unofficial means is not covered by Apple's warranty.[23]

[edit] Criticism
Apple has received criticism from Engadget's Ryan Block and AppleMatters' Aayush Arya for its differential treatment between iPhone owners and iPod Touch owners. This is in spite of the fact that the two devices are essentially the same, with the exception of the fact that the iPhone incorporates phone functionality, on top of a number of other minor differences. Such criticism is primarily targeted towards Apple's decision to charge for software that is given to iPhone owners for free, as well arbitrarily excluding certain features from the iPod Touch software that are included in the iPhone.[29][30]
Apple state in their quarterly SEC filings that they can add features for free to iPhone (and Apple TV) because the revenue from these products is accounted for on a subscription basis under Sarbanes-Oxley Act rules, rather than as a one time payment. As the iPod Touch is not accounted for as a subscription, the Sarbanes-Oxley means that Apple have to charge for added functionality.[31]
The first action by Apple in this regard was the release of the "January Software Upgrade" in January 2008. For a price of $19.95, this upgrade offered iPod Touch owners five applications (Mail, Maps, Stocks, Notes, and Weather) that were featured on the iPhone when it was released in June 2007, but were excluded from the iPod Touch when it was released in September 2007. [6] In July 2008, Apple released the iPhone 2.0 Software Update to iPhone users for free, while offering the update to iPod Touch owners for a fee of $9.95.[32] Most recently, Apple decided to quietly exclude the Google Street View feature added on iPhone firmware version 2.2 from the same version of firmware released on the iPod Touch.[33]
