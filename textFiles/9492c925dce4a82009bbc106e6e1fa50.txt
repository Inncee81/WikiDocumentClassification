The British monarchy is the direct successor to those of England and Scotland. For those, see List of English monarchs and List of Scottish monarchs.

See also: List of British consorts.





The Royal Arms of the United Kingdom (as displayed outside Scotland) since the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, featuring the arms of England in the first and fourth quarters, Scotland in the second, and Ireland in the third.


This is a list of the monarchs of Great Britain and the United Kingdom. The Kingdom of Great Britain was formed on 1 May 1707 with the merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland, which had been in personal union under the House of Stuart since 24 March 1603. On 1 January 1801 Great Britain merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After most of Ireland left the union on 6 December 1922, on 12 April 1927 its name was amended to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

[edit] Regnal numbering
Following the Acts of Union, regnal numbering of subsequent monarchs followed on from those of England. William IV, Edward VII, Edward VIII, and Elizabeth II all taking the next number in the English sequence. As a result of Scottish opposition to the use of the style Elizabeth II, it was suggested by Winston Churchill that all future monarchs should take the next number from either the English or Scottish sequence, whichever was higher.[12] This new rule was consistent, in that had it been applied since the Union, it would not have changed the regnal numbers of any previous post-union monarch.
