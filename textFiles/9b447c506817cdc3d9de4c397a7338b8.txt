From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
This is a list of artists who create contemporary art, i.e. those whose peak of activity can be situated somewhere between the 1970s (the advent of postmodernism) and the present day. Artists in this list have gained recognition or proven their importance because their work has been shown in contemporary art exhibitions of worldwide importance, such as the documenta or the Venice Biennale, the Sao Paulo Art Biennial or exhibited in major modern or contemporary art museums and institutes.
There may be some overlap with the list of modern artists, since it is difficult to define the boundaries between modern and contemporary art.
Add names in alphabetical order.
