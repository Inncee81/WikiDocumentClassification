A portmanteau of the words Global and English, Globish is a version of the English language that uses only the most common 1500 English words. It recognizes, and forms a system for organization of, the actual English used by non-English-speakers of varying native languages when communicating with each other or with Anglophones.
Unlike many subsets of English constructed by English speakers for various purposes (Special English, Basic English), Globish is derived by non-native English speakers from the common practices they instinctively adopt when using English as a "middle ground" between many cultures. However, because only 1500 basic words define Globish, it becomes far simpler for novices to absorb those specific spellings and pronunciations than with conventional means of language learning. When using Globish, the recommendation is to stick to simple short sentences, which does not prevent the result from still being correct English; it just achieves an immediate understanding hit rate far better with, or among, non-native speakers, and does not impair the communication with Anglophones.
Globish also proposes a number of communication tips which help ensure a better understanding without enhancing one’s command of English.
It also eventually offers software programs, which flag the too-complicated words that would not be understood by all audiences, and gives lists of simpler and more frequent synonyms which will ensure the best possible level of understanding.

[edit] Uses and alternatives





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Please see the discussion on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved. (January 2008)


Use of Globish has continued to expand as a tool of common understanding in simple international communication. This is due to its practicality, in parallel with the need of means of communication that the globalization phenomenon entails. It was created specifically with the business world in mind due to a project its creator had with IBM when in an international Executive position. Globish in use is a defined and restricted version of English, and thus still a natural language unlike the constructed languages, such as Esperanto, Ido, Volapük or Interlingua.

[edit] Some attempts at formalizing Globish
The term Globish has also been used for some attempts at formalizing it, such as:

A small subset of English with substantially simplified spelling and pronunciation proposed in 1998 by Madhukar Gogate.[1]
A small 1500-word subset of English with conventional spelling and pronunciation, serving as an aid for French-speaking people to learn core English. Promoted in the 2004 French book Parlez Globish by Jean-Paul Nerrière. (Versions of this book are now available in several other languages.)[2]


[edit] Debate about Globish
This expansion of Globish goes to the point that some consider it a menace to cultural diversity and purity of non-English languages. Some also find Globish limited in what it can express, but the idea is that people would share a vocabulary set up by the creation of the language.
