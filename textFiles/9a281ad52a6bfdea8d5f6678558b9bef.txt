Lakshmi (pronunciation: [ləkʂ.miː]; Sanskrit: लक्ष्मी lakṣmī) is the Hindu goddess of wealth, prosperity, and generosity; and the embodiment of beauty, grace and charm. Representations of Lakshmi (or Shri) are found also in Jain and Buddhist monuments, with the earliest archeological representation found in Buddhist monuments. [1]
She protects her devotee from all kinds of misery and money-related sorrows
Lakshmi in Sanskrit is derived from its elemental form "lakS," meaning to perceive or observe.[2] This is synonymous with lakṣya, meaning aim or objective. Lakshmi is thus goddess of the means to achieving objectives, including prosperity in the lives of humankind.
She is the consort of Vishnu[3] and married Rama (in her incarnation as Sita) and Krishna (as Rukmini).

[edit] Evolution and Legends
Deva and Asuras were both mortal (mrita) at one time. Seeking immortality they churned the ocean of milk. Vishnu incarnated as "kurma" the tortoise on which was placed a mountain and a great venom spewing serpent was wrapped around it and used to churn the ocean.
A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Among these, importantly, was Goddess Lakshmi, the daughter of the king of the milky ocean. The last to come up was "amritam", the "nectar of immortality". With this the avatar of "kurma", the tortoise ended. Vishnu, then took up form of a beautiful maiden to distract "raakshasas" and gave immortality to the "deva". Sri Lakshmi, very much later married Shri Vishnu. Shri is a honorofic address that is probably derived from Lakshmi and is used till date for males all over India. The equivalent for females is "Srimati" if she is married.




Lakshmi with Vishnu at Vaikuntha


The moon also appeared from the ocean during the churning, the 'moon' (chandra) making it her brother. Alakshmi, the goddess of misfortune, is Lakshmi's elder sister. According to the Vishnu Purana, Lakshmi is the daughter of Bhrigu and Khyaati and resided in Swarga but due to the curse of Durvasa, she left Swarga and made Ksheersagara her home.
The etymology and meanings of the word lakshmi is best given in Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary compiled in the 19th century in British India.
1. laksmIka meaning a mark , sign , token is in Rik Veda x , 71 , 2 and Nirukta iv , 10.
2. laksmi ( with or without pAp'I ) is a bad sign or an impending misfortune referred to Atharva Veda and Apasthambha Shrauta Suutra.
3. In older Sanskrit language it is used used usually with "p'uNyA" meaning a good sign , good fortune , prosperity , success , happiness in Atharva Veda.
4. Laksmi personifies wealth, riches, beauty , loveliness , grace , charm , splendour , lustre in Mahabharata.
5. Laksmi as noun is goddess of fortune and beauty ( frequently in the later mythology identified with Śrī and regarded as the wife of Viṣṇu or Nārāyaṇa )
6. According to Sir Monier Williams, "Religious thought and life in India", 45 , 40-43 she sprang with other precious things from the foam of the ocean when churned by the gods and demons for the recovery of the Amṛta. She appeared with a lotus in her hand , whence she is also called Padmā.
7. According to another legend she appeared at the creation floating over the water on the expanded petals of a lotusflower , she is also variously regarded as a wife of Sūrya , as a wife of Prajā-pati , as a wife of Dharma and mother of Kāma , as sister or mother of Dhātṛ and Vidhātṛ , as wife of Datt^atreya , as one of the 9 Śaktis of Viṣṇu , as a manifestation of Prakṛti &c. , as identified with Dākshāyaṇī in Bharat^aśrama , and with Sītā , wife of Rāma , and with other women )

[edit] Explanation of Mahalakshmi




Goddess Lakshmi seated


Mahalakshmi is the presiding Goddess of the Middle episode of Devi Mahatmya. Here she is depicted as Devi in her universal form as Shakti. The manifestation of the Devi to kill Mahishasura is formed by the effulgences of all the gods. The Goddess is described as eighteen armed bearing string of beads, battle axe, maze, arrow, thunderbolt, lotus, bow, water-pot, cudgel, lance, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose and the discus sudarsana. She has a complexion of coral and is seated on a lotus. [4] She is known as Ashta Dasa Bhuja Mahalakshmi.
She is seen in two forms, Bhudevi and Sridevi, both either side of Sri Venkateshwara or Vishnu. Bhudevi is the representation and totally of the Material world or energy called the aparam Prakriti, in which She is called Mother Earth. Sridevi is the Spiritual world or energy called the Param Prakriti. Most people are mistaken that they are separate beings although they are one, Lakshmi. Lakshmi is the power of Lord Vishnu. Fact|date=May 2008}}
Mahalakshmi's presence is also found on Lord Sri Venkateswara (at Tirumala) or Vishnu's chest, at the Heart. Lakshmi is the embodiment of Love, from which devotion to God or Bhakti flows from. It is through Love/Bhakti or Lakshmi that the atma or soul is able to reach God or Vishnu. She is also the personification of the Spiritual energy within us and universe called Kundalini. Also, She embodies the Spiritual World or Vaikunta; the abode of Lakshmi-Narayana or Vishnu, or what would be considered Heaven in Vaishnavism. She is also the Divine qualities of God and the soul. Lakshmi is the embodiment of God's superior spiritual feminine energy or the Param Prakriti, which purifies, empowers and uplifts the individual. Hence, She is called the Goddess of Fortune.

[edit] Iconography




Sculpture of Lakshmi


Physically, goddess Lakshmi is described as a fair lady, with four arms, standing upon a lotus, dressed in fine garments and precious jewels, bestowing coins of prosperity and flanked by elephants signifying her royal power. Her expression is always calm and loving. The most striking feature of the iconography of Lakshmi is her persistent association with the lotus. The meaning of the lotus in relation to Shri-Lakshmi refers to purity and spiritual power. Rooted in the mud but blossoming above the water, completely uncontaminated by the mud, the lotus represents spiritual perfection and authority which rises above worldly contamination. Furthermore, the lotus seat is a common motif in Hindu iconography. The lotus also symbolizes the fertile growth of organic life, as the world is continually reborn on a lotus growing out of Vishnu's navel. Lakshmi is worshiped daily, but October is the special month. Her worship ceremonies include people offering food and sweets, chanting her 108 names, prayers repeated, and devotional songs sung.
Goddess Lakshmi's traditionally accepted vehicle, the owl (Ulooka in Sanskrit), is a bird that sleeps through the day and prowls through the night.

[edit] Celebration in Hindu society




Laxmi idol at Bhubaneswar during (Laxmi Puja) Festival


Hindus worship Lakshmi the most on Diwali, the festival of lights. According to tradition people would put small oil lamps outside their homes on Diwali and hope Lakshmi will come to bless them.
In Bengal, Lakshmi is worshiped during a night in Autumn when the moon is full, the brightest night of the year. It is believed that she showers wealth on this night.She, along with her mount, the great white owl, descends to earth and takes away the darkness of poverty, stagnation, anger, and laziness from our lives. The significance of her vahana owl is that it takes goddess laxmi to the darker areas ,so that they can be enlightend.
The prefix Sri (also spelled as Shri, pronounced as shree) renders as 'one who takes delight in' Sri Lakshmi, meaning wealth, wealth of any kind. Any thing that need be affluent gets the auspicious prefix or suffix 'Lakshmi', or 'Sri' like Rajya Lakshmi (Wealth of Empire), Shanti Sri (Wealth of Peace), etc. In modern India, common titles standing in for the English Mr. and Mrs. are Shri (also Sri or Shree) and Shrimati (also Srimati or Shreemati), as in "Sri Gupta" or "Srimati Mangeshkar".
Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped by those who wish to acquire or to preserve wealth. It is believed that Lakshmi (wealth) goes only to those houses which are clean and where the people are hardworking. She does not visit the places which are unclean/dirty or where the people are lazy.
In the Sri Vaishnava philosophy however, Sri (Lakshmi) is honored as the "Iswarigm sarva bhootanam" i.e. the Supreme goddess and not just the goddess of wealth.
In Uttarakhand, after the worship of the goddess on Diwali night, the Shankha or Conch is not blown. This is because the shankha is also from the ocean like the goddess herself, so it is given a day of rest.
Karaveera Nivasini Mahalakshmi also known as Ambabai is the patron goddess of Kolhapur city, Maharashtra.

[edit] Lakshmi Puja in Orissa
Manabasa Gurubara
With the harvest brought home the farmers feel greatly satisfied with the yield. After six months of toil in the field, they fill the granaries with the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi. So, the whole month of Margashira(December-January) is spent in worshipping the Goddess. All the rituals connected with the festival "Manabasa Gurubara" or "Lakshmi Puja" is done by housewives themselves. On each Thursday of the month the houses are plastered with cow-dung, the floors are decorated with beautiful floral designs drawn with rice-powder mixed with water. This is called Jhoti. Footmarks are painted from the doorstep to the place of worship as if Goddess Lakshmi has entered the house. The roofs are decorated with flower garlands and festoon woven out of paddy stalks. Main Ritual After purificatory bath in the morning the housewives worship the Goddess, not through an image but significantly through paddy-measures. Different varieties of rice-cakes and 'Kshiri' (rice-soup prepared with milk and sugar) are prepared in every household and are offered to the deity and then taken by all. The Legend In the evening the 'Laxmi Purana' is read or recited in which an interesting story is told. Once Shreeya, an untouchable woman worshipped Goddess Lakshmi by observing this festival. Being moved by her devotion Lakshmi left Her permanent abode, the temple which is situated inside the campus of the temple of Lord Jagannatha and visited Shreeya's house. When Lord Balabhadra, the elder brother of Lord Jagannatha came to know about this, She was declared defiled and was not allowed to come back into the temple. Lakshmi was deeply hurt and went to her father Sahara.
When Lakshmi went out of the temple all wealth in the temple started vanishing. Later the Gods Balabhadra and Jagannatha couldn't find food to sustain themselves. They came out of the temple in the attire of Brahmin beggars in search of food. Ultimately they landed at the door of the Goddess Lakshmi. Balabhadra apologised for the mistake and all of them returned to the temple.
The 'Purana' ultimately teaches all to pay extreme regard to Goddess Lakshmi and the person who disregards Her is sure to fall on evil days. This means that wealth should be well protected and properly used and misutilisation of wealth is sure to make a person suffer.
GajaLakshmi Puja
Gaja Lakshmi Puja is celebrated in the Sharad Purnima,full-moon day in the Oriya month of Aswina(September- October). This autumn festival is one of the most popular and important festival of Orissa. The goddess of wealth is worshipped for one day and in some places it is celebrated for 7 to10 days. and the festival is religiously celebrated by the business community in Orissa.In all over Orissa richly decorated and beautiful made images of Goddess Gaja Lakshmi are installed and the festival instils a spirit of holiness and sancity into the whole community so much so that people of other faiths participate in it with abundant warmth and sincerity. In Orissa, this festival also known as Kumar Purnima falls on the fullmoon - Purnima. Girls and Boys wear new clothes and generally have a good time with family and friends.
Main Ritual In the early morning the girls after their purificatory bath wear new garments and make food-offerings to the Sun. They observe fasting for the day. In the evening when the moon rises they again make food offerings of a special variety and take it after the rituals are over.
It is a festival of rejoicing for the girls. All of them sing and dance. The songs are of special nature. They also play a kind of game known as 'Puchi'. They also indulge in other varieties of country-games

[edit] Worship
Two of the most famous prayers for worshipping Ma Lakshmi are: Sri Lakshmi Stuti By Indra and Sri Sukta. There is another famous prayer pronounced by the great sage Agastua: Agastya Lakshmi Stotra.

They can be worshipped in various forms such as LakshmiNarayana, LakshmiNarasimha, SitaRam, RadhaKrishna, VithalRakhumai(VithhalRukmini).
