This article is an expansion of a section entitled Hypomania from within the main article: Bipolar disorder.

Hypomania (literally, below mania) is a mood state characterized by persistent and pervasive elevated or irritable mood, and thoughts and behaviors that are consistent with such a mood state. An unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic when asymptomatic. People experiencing hypomanic symptoms typically have a flood of ideas, and sometimes mildly grandiose thoughts and visions. It is distinguished from mania by the absence of psychotic symptoms and by its lower degree of impact on functioning. Hypomania is a feature of two mood disorders: bipolar II disorder and cyclothymia. Hypomania can also have a benefit in creativity and productive energy. Many have cited it as a gateway to their success, and a large number of people with creative talents have experienced hypomania or other symptoms of bipolar disorder. Classic symptoms of hypomania include mild euphoria, a flood of ideas, endless energy, and a desire and drive for success. Unlike a lot of other mood disorders, people suffering from hypomania tend to be extremely goal oriented and many successful people have credited bipolar disorder in their successes. [1]

[edit] Episodes
According to the DSM-IV-TR, a hypomanic episode includes, over the course of at least 4 days, elevated mood plus three of the following symptoms OR irritable mood plus four of the following symptoms:

pressured speech; rapid talking
inflated self-esteem or grandiosity;
decreased need for sleep;
flight of ideas or the subjective experience that thoughts are racing;
easy distractibility and attention-deficit (superficially similar to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder);
increase in psychomotor agitation; and
steep involvement in pleasurable activities that may have a high potential for negative psycho-social or physical consequences (e.g., the person engages in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). [2]

In the hypomanic state, people may feel like they can't slow their mind down, and that the speeding thoughts are crafted exceptionally well. Some examples are speaking or writing in rhyme or alliteration without planning it first; quick responses to people talking; or the ability to improvise easily on the spot.
Another type of behavioral response sometimes included as a symptom is emotional flattening or blunted affect. A person may seem unusually cold, uncaring, or arrogant, showing little or no emotional responsiveness.[citation needed]
People in hypomanic episodes do not have delusions or hallucinations. They do not lose touch with reality in the sense that they know who they are and what is real. What can be a problem, however, is that they tend to overestimate their capabilities and fail to see the obvious risks involved in their ventures. For example, if they are in business, they may suddenly decide to expand in a way that is not really practical or set up schemes for which they are ill prepared.
Other forms of less inhibited behavior include reckless driving, gambling, spending sprees and sexual adventures. They may also have lots of new ideas but do not follow them through. They are often very jolly to be with but can quickly become very impatient or unpleasant if they cannot get what they want.

[edit] Possible benefits
People with hypomania are generally perceived as being energetic, euphoric, visionary, overflowing with new ideas, and sometimes over-confident and very charismatic. Unlike full-blown mania, they are sufficiently capable of coherent thought and action to participate in everyday activities. A person in the state of hypomania might be immune to fear and doubt and have little social inhibition. People experiencing hypomania are the typical "life of the party". They may talk to strangers easily, offer solutions to problems, and find pleasure in small activities.

[edit] Relationship with disorders
Cyclothymia is a condition of continued mood fluctuations between hypomania and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a Major Depressive Episode. These are often interspersed with periods of normal moods. [3]
When a patient presents with a history of one or more hypomanic episodes and one or more depressive episodes that meet the criteria for a Major Depressive Episode, Bipolar II Disorder is diagnosed.[4]
If left untreated, hypomania can slip deeper and deeper into mania (and sometimes psychosis), in which case, Bipolar I Disorder is often diagnosed.[5] (See also, Kindling model)

[edit] Treatment
It is unknown to what degree hypomanic symptoms can occur without a depressive component. Patients may be relatively unlikely to seek psychiatric treatment for hypomania alone. However, many hypomanic patients experience:

lower need for sleep
racing thoughts
obsessive behavior, whether mild or severe
poor judgment relative to a particular situation's judgment call
uncontrollable, or only partially controllable, impulsivity
excessive sexual activity

Plus other out-of-character behaviors that the person may regret following the conclusion of the mood episode. A more mild form of elevated mood which has fewer negative behaviours is hyperthymic temperament
Hypomania can signal the beginning of a more severe manic episode, and often does result in a more severe manic episode if the hypomanic episode remains untreated. A hypomanic episode can also directly precede a depressive episode.
Virtually all clinical trials of medications for the non-depressive phases of bipolar illnesses involve treating patients for psychotic mania during the initial, or acute, phase of mania. Such trials are the basis upon which appropriate medication is recommended; high doses are justified in the case of mania, in order to remove the patient from immediate danger. This is in direct contrast to hypomania, however, which involves different considerations and almost always demands much greater case-by-case clinical judgment. Typical prescribed medications for hypomania include mood stabilizers such as Depakote and lithium carbonate as well as atypical antipsychotics such as Zyprexa and Seroquel.

Radiohead front man Thom Yorke reportedly responded, "Hypomania? Yes, that's exactly what it was," when asked about his mental state after the release of the group's album OK Computer. Iggy Pop was diagnosed with hypomania during his stay in a mental hospital in the mid-1970s. It has also been suggested[who?] that Richey Edwards, the "fatalistic Manic Street Preacher" (Mojo, 2003), and the late Syd Barrett of the band Pink Floyd have experienced hypomania. In the biographical documentary An Unreasonable Man, Ralph Nader is described as having hypomania.
Honoré de Balzac, French author of the Human Comedy, is attributed with having hypomania. His writing sessions continued from midnight to noon, functioning on four hours of sleep. Intermittently during these episodes, Balzac would consume massive amounts of coffee. However, it is far from apparent whether these are based on psychiatric diagnosis, as bipolar symptoms are frequently misunderstood, misattributed and glamorized in popular culture.[citation needed]
John Gartner's book The Hypomanic Edge claims notable people including Christopher Columbus, Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Carnegie, Howard Zinn and Louis B. Mayer owe their innovativeness and drive, as well as their eccentricities, to hypomanic temperaments.[page number needed] Critics, however, assert that Gartner vastly overstates his case.[citation needed] Within the book, Gartner suggests that the constructive behaviors associated with hypomania may contribute to bipolar disorder's evolutionary survival.[page number needed] He fails, however, to address the possibility that the depressive component may be an evolutionary adaptive mechanism instead, a theory which has been postulated by various evolutionary psychologists.[6]
