Universal design is a relatively new paradigm that emerged from "barrier-free" or "accessible design" and "assistive technology." Universal design strives to be a broad-spectrum solution that produces buildings, products and environments that are usable and effective for everyone, not just people with disabilities. Moreover, it recognizes the importance of how things look. For example, while built up handles are a way to make utensils more usable for people with gripping limitations, some companies introduced larger, easy to grip and attractive handles as feature of mass produced utensils. They appeal to a wide range of consumers.
As life expectancy rises and modern medicine has increased the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent.
Universal design is a part of everyday living and is all around us. The "undo" command in most software products is a good example. Color-contrast dish ware with steep sides that assist those with visual problems as well as those with dexterity problems are another. Additional examples include cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures and low-floor buses that kneel and are equipped with ramps rather than lifts.

[edit] The Principles of Universal Design
"The authors, a working group of architects, product designers, engineers and environmental design researchers, collaborated to establish the following Principles of Universal Design to guide a wide range of design disciplines including environments, products, and communications." - [1]

Equitable use
Flexibility in use
Simple and intuitive
Perceptible information
Tolerance for error
Low physical effort
Size and space for approach and use

(from the Center for Universal Design)
These principles are broader than that of accessible design.

[edit] Examples

Ramps at A-Tech
Smooth ground surfaces of entranceways, without stairs
Wide interior doors and hallways
Lever handles for opening doors rather than twisting knobs
Light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches
Buttons on control panels that can be distinguished by touch
Bright and appropriate lighting, particularly task lighting
Auditory output redundant with information on visual displays
Visual output redundant with information in auditory output
Contrast controls on visual output
Use of meaningful icons as well as text labels
Clear lines of sight (to reduce dependence on sound)
Volume controls on auditory output
Speed controls on auditory output
Choice of language on speech output
Ramp access in swimming pools
Closed captioning on television networks


[edit] Design standards
In October 2003, representatives from China, Japan, and South Korea met in Beijing and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use. Their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers, among other areas, standards on containers and wrappings of household goods (based on a proposal from experts in Japan), and standardization of signs for public facilities, a subject which was of particular interest to China as prepared to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.
The International Organization for Standardization, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, and the International Electrotechnical Commission have developed:

[1]; CEN/CENELEC Guide 6. Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities (Identical to ISO/IEC Guide 71, but free for download)

These standards are still under development:

ISO 20282-1 – Ease of operation of everyday products — Part 1: Context of use and user characteristics
ISO 20282-2 – Ease of operation of everyday products — Part 2: Test method
