Look up dysphoria in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

Dysphoria (from Greek δύσφορος (dysphoros), from δυσ-, difficult, and φέρω, to bear) is generally characterized as an unpleasant or uncomfortable mood, such as sadness (depressed mood), anxiety, irritability, or restlessness.[1] Etymologically, it is the opposite of euphoria.
Dysphoria refers only to a condition of mood and may be experienced in response to ordinary life events, such as illness or grief. Additionally, it is a feature of many psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders and mood disorders. Dysphoria is usually experienced during depressive episodes, but in people with bipolar disorder, it may also be experienced during manic or hypomanic episodes.[2] Dysphoria in the context of a mood disorder indicates a heightened risk of suicide.[2]
Dysphoria can be chemically induced by substances including µ-opioid antagonists[3] and selective ĸ-opioid agonists.[4] Dysphoria is also one of the symptoms of hypoglycemia.[citation needed]
