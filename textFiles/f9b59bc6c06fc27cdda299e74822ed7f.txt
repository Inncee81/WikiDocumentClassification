Aeron chair


The Aeron chair is a product of Herman Miller designed in 1994 by Don Chadwick and Bill Stumpf. It is an ergonomic chair that is regarded by many users as inherently very comfortable due to its wide range of fit (available in three sizes) and adjustability. Its novel design has gained it a spot in the New York Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection.[1] The chair's exclusivity became a symbol of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s.
The chair departs from a typical upholstery-over-cushioning-base design. Instead, the seat and back are made of a stretched, semi-transparent, and flexible mesh called Pellicle. It can be customized through modular extensions like lumbar support, sacral support (dubbed PostureFit), fixed or adjustable armrests and varied bases to accommodate diverse fields of deployment.
Malcom Gladwell tells the story about the development and marketing challenges of the Aeron in his book, Blink.
