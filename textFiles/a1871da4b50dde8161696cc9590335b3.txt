For other uses, see Illuminati (disambiguation).
Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, "enlightened") is a name that refers to several groups, both historical and modern, and both real and fictitious. Historically, it refers specifically to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1st, 1776. In modern times it is also used to refer to a purported conspiratorial organization which acts as a shadowy "power behind the throne," allegedly controlling world affairs through present day governments and corporations, usually as a modern incarnation or continuation of the Bavarian Illuminati. In this context, Illuminati is often used in reference to a New World Order (NWO). Many conspiracy theorists believe the Illuminati are the masterminds behind events that will lead to the establishment of such a New World Order. Confusing the issue further is the fact that there are also several modern fraternal groups which include the word "Illuminati" in their names.

History




Adam Weishaupt


This movement was founded on May 1, 1776, in Ingolstadt (Upper Bavaria), by Jesuit-taught Adam Weishaupt (d. 1830),[1] who was the first lay professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt.[2] The movement was made up of freethinkers, as an offshoot of the Enlightenment,[3] which some amateur historians believe was a conspiracy to infiltrate and overthrow the governments of many European states.[4] The group's adherents were given the name "Illuminati," although they called themselves "Perfectibilists". The group has also been called the Illuminati Order and the Bavarian Illuminati, and the movement itself has been referred to as Illuminism (after illuminism). In 1777, Karl Theodor became ruler of Bavaria. He was a proponent of Enlightened Despotism and, in 1784, his government banned all secret societies, including the Illuminati.
During the period when it was legally allowed to operate, many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack, who was also the number two man in the operation and was caught with much of the group's documentation when his home was searched.[5] The Illuminati's members pledged obedience to their superiors, and were divided into three main classes, each with several degrees. The order had its branches in most countries of the European continent; it reportedly had around 2,000 members over the span of 10 years.[2] The scheme had its attraction for literary men, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder, and even for the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar. Internal rupture and panic over succession preceded its downfall, which was effected by The Secular Edict made by the Bavarian government in 1785.[2]

Modern Illuminati
Main article: New World Order (conspiracy theory)
Writers such as David Icke, Ryan Burke, Jüri Lina and Morgan Gricar, have argued that the Bavarian Illuminati survived, possibly to this day. Many of these theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by a secret society calling itself the Illuminati.[6][7] Theorists have claimed that many notable people were or are members of the Illuminati, including Winston Churchill,[8] David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.[9]
In addition to the conspiracy theories, several modern groups have used the name Illuminati in founding their own rites. Some of these include the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) founded by Theodor Reuss, and later restructured by Aleister Crowley, The Grand Lodge Rockefeller founded by David Goldman, Orden Illuminati founded by Gabriel López de Rojas, The Illuminati Order[10] and others.

In popular culture
The Illuminati are a common theme in popular culture. They appear in many fictional works and in many genres: in print,[11] in film,[12] on TV,[13] in numerous video games,[14] comic book series,[15] as well as in both trading card and roleplaying games.[16].
