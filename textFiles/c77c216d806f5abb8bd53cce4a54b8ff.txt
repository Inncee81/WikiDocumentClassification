The Internet Channel is a version of the Opera 9 web browser for use on the Wii by Opera Software and Nintendo.[1] On December 22, 2006, a free beta version (promoted as a "trial version") of the browser was released.[2] The final version of the browser became available on April 11, 2007 and was free to download until the last day of June; the browser now costs 500 Nintendo Points.[3] The Opera Software company was previously responsible for the Nintendo DS Browser for Nintendo's handheld system.
Internet Channel uses whichever internet connection is chosen in the Wii Settings to retrieve pages directly from a web site's HTTP or HTTPS server, not through a network of proxy servers as in Opera Mini products. Internet Channel is capable of rendering most web sites in the same manner as its desktop counterpart by using Opera's Medium Screen Rendering technology.

[edit] History
On May 10, 2006, the Opera Software company announced plans to develop a web browser for the Wii.[4]

[edit] Trial version
A trial version of the Internet Channel was released in December 2006, and a full version followed in April 2007. While in the beta stages of the development, this version of the Opera web browser implements some of the most widely-reported features of the prospective final version. For example, it is possible to zoom in on web pages (by one increment) with the "+" button on the Wii Remote and pan around by holding the "B" button, and both Flash and AJAX functions are present. In addition, an alternative single-column rendering mode with large-print text can be toggled by pressing the "2" button on the Wii Remote, similar to the Small Screen Rendering mode seen on Opera's Nintendo DS Browser.
Similar to other web browsers, the trial version has a "Favorites" system to allow users to bookmark sites. The Favorites page can be accessed either by pressing the '1' button on the Wii Remote or the on-screen button which has a star symbol. Favorites can be added, deleted and edited from the Favorites page. The browser displays a thumbnail image of each bookmarked site.
The functionality of the trial version was limited in some respects. Web addresses could only be entered on the home page and there was no browsing history (only the basic back/forward system for accessing previous pages). The browser had a difficult time handling hyperlinks that would normally open a new window via Javascript. There were no user-configurable settings such as custom home pages (the browser has a default splash page), preferences for cookies, or parental control features (although the Internet Channel can be locked out entirely via parental control configured from the Wii menu), and there was no way to hide or "auto-hide" the navigation bar. Also, the total number of favorites a user could save was limited to 21 URLs.

[edit] Release version
On March 22, 2007, Nintendo issued a press release[5] stating that the completed release version of the Internet Channel would be released sometime in April and not at the end of March, as they previously said. The full version of the Internet Channel was released in April 2007.[6][7] Keyboard support was added in an Internet Channel update on October 10, 2007.[8] The update must be downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel and costs no additional points if the Internet Channel had been previously downloaded.
Before the release of Opera 9.5, the Internet Channel's layout engine was actually more advanced than Opera for desktops, as it included bug fixes that were not available in the desktop edition prior to version 9.5.[9]

[edit] Features
The Opera-based Wii browser allows users full access to the Web and supports all the same web standards that are included in the desktop versions of Opera, including CSS and JavaScript. Like Opera 9, the Internet Channel fully passes the Acid2 web browser test. It is also possible for the browser to use technologies such as Ajax, RSS, and Adobe Flash 7. Opera Software has indicated that the functionality will allow for third parties to create web applications specifically designed for the use on the Wii Browser. The company has also stated that some Wii video games may implement the use of the browser.[10]
Opera Software designed the Wii browser to suit a "living room environment"; in contrast to the appearance of the Opera web browser on computer monitors, fonts are larger and the interface is simplified for easier use,[10] similar to the style employed for MSN TV. Currently the user can zoom in on a detail on a web page, with animated transitions.
As the browser supports Flash, users have the ability to interact with Flash-based software using the Wii Remote. As a result, several websites have been created or expanded to gather Wii-friendly Internet games. However, the Flash SDK that is offered to developers only supports technologies up to Flash Player version 7. Due to this limitation, any website that requires a newer version of Flash Player will not operate properly. This is important as many media-heavy websites require the use of Flash 10 or higher. Windows Media Player and Real Video content at this point are also incompatible with the Internet Channel.
Third party APIs and SDKs have been released that allow developers to read the values of the Wii Remote buttons in both Flash and Javascript. This allows for software that previously required keyboard controls to be converted for use with the Wii Remote.[11][12]
The Internet Channel supports the use of a USB keyboard for input. This functionality was added in a Wii system update and Internet Channel update (downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel) on October 10, 2007.
The browser is also used to stream BBC iPlayer videos from April 9, 2008 after an exclusive deal was made with Nintendo UK and the BBC to offer their catch-up service for the Wii. BBC have also speculated at a possible separate iPlayer Channel on the Wii Menu for easier access, rather than having to boot up the Internet Channel.[13]
Starting in January 2009, the browser can also be used to stream Youtube videos by visiting the Youtube for television website which is only accessible from a game console (currently only the Wii and PS3). The URL is www.youtube.com/tv.

[edit] Updates
This is a list of updates to the Internet Channel. For more information see Wii System Software.
April 11, 2007: Upgraded to the full version.
October 10, 2007: Added USB keyboard support. Launch time has been reduced. Up to 56 favorites can be saved. Ability to send Favorites to people in the Wii's Address Book. Ability to highlight words on a Web page and copy it to the "Search" function. Ability to type longer messages without the virtual keyboard lagging. The update is free of charge if the Internet Channel had previously been downloaded.[8]
