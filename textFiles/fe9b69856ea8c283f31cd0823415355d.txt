Ivan Bilibin: Koshchey the Deathless


In Russian folklore, Koschei (Russian: Коще́й, Koshchey, also Kashchei or Kashchey or Kościej (Polish)) is an evil person of ugly senile appearance, menacing principally young women. Koschei is also known as Koschei the Immortal or Koschei the Deathless (Russian: Коще́й Бессме́ртный), as well as Tzar Koschei. As is usual in Russian transliterations, there are numerous other spellings, such as Koshchei, Kashchej and Kaschei. The spelling in other Slavic languages (like Polish "Kościej") suggests that his name may be derived from "kost" (rus. кость pol. kość=bone); thus suggesting a skeleton-like appearance.
Koschei cannot be killed by conventional means targeting his body. His soul is hidden separate from his body inside a needle, which is in an egg, which is in a duck, which is in a hare, which is in an iron chest, which is buried under a green oak tree, which is on the island of Buyan, in the ocean. As long as his soul is safe, he cannot die. If the chest is dug up and opened, the hare will bolt away. If it is killed, the duck will emerge and try to fly off. Anyone possessing the egg has Koschei in their power. He begins to weaken, becomes sick and immediately loses the use of his magic. If the egg is tossed about, he likewise is flung around against his will. If the egg is broken (in some tales this must be done by specifically breaking it against Koschei's forehead), Koschei will die.

[edit] Other uses of the name

James Branch Cabell used the spelling Koshchei in several of his books. His character, however, was a sort of over-deity who presides over all the "first-level" human gods (such as Jehovah and Loki). Robert A. Heinlein used Cabell's version in his book Job: A Comedy of Justice.

In Andrei Belyanin's Tsar Gorokh's Detective Agency series of novels, Koschei is the main villain of most of the stories. He is described as a criminal mastermind a hundred times worse than Osama bin Laden.
In Rifts, the roleplaying game, a type of demon in Russia is the Koschei (Rifts typically turns individual demons in mythology into species).
In the MMORPG RuneScape, one of the quests (the Fremennik Trials) features Koschei the Deathless as a mysterious warrior whom the player must best thrice in combat to prove their worth as a warrior.
The Werewolf RPG sourcebook Rage Across Russia mentions Koschei as one of the five Talons of the Wyrm. It is summoned from the Umbra by Baba Yaga during her battle with Nosferatu.
While not under the same name, the character of Koschei appears in the Fabled Lands gamebook series, specifically "The Plains of Howling Darkness" and "Over The Blood-Dark Sea".
In The Deathless by Keith R.A. DeCandido, the modern day resurrection of Koschei is thwarted by Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
In The Witcher (both video game and the story "The Road with No Return"), Koschei is a species of huge, magically-created spider-like creature. In the video game, Koschei serves as one of the "boss" creatures.
