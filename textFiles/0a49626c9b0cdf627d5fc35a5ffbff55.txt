Object Management Group (OMG) is a consortium, originally aimed at setting standards for distributed object-oriented systems, and is now focused on modeling (programs, systems and business processes) and model-based standards.

[edit] Overview
OMG provide only specifications, and does not provide implementations. But before a specification can be accepted as a standard by OMG, the members of the winning submitter team must guarantee that they will bring a conforming product to market within a year. This is an attempt to prevent unimplemented (and unimplementable) standards.
Other private companies or open source groups are encouraged to produce conforming products and OMG is attempting to develop mechanisms to enforcing true interoperability.

[edit] History
Founded in 1989 by eleven companies (including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, American Airlines and Data General), OMG tried to create a heterogeneous distributed object standard.
The goal was a common portable and interoperable object model with methods and data that work using all types of development environments on all types of platforms.
Today, over 800 companies from both the computer industry and software-using companies from other industries are members of OMG. Since 2000 the OMG's International Headquarters are located in Needham, Massachusetts.
As of June 2006 the latest version of UML is 2.1, MOF is 2.0 and XMI is 2.1.
In 2006 the BPMN language specification was adopted as a standard by OMG.
In 2007 the Business Motivation Model (BMM) was adopted as a standard by the OMG. The BMM is a metamodel that provides a vocabulary for corporate governance and strategic planning and is particularly relevant to businesses undertaking governance, regulatory compliance, business transformation and strategic planning activities.

[edit] OMG products

[edit] Common Object Request Broker Architecture
At its founding, OMG set out to create the initial Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard which appeared in 1991. As of 31 March 2003, the latest standard is CORBA 3.0. OMG has also developed a core set of standards adapting CORBA for embedded and real-time systems. Implementations of real time CORBA are widely used in control systems in ships and aircraft.

[edit] Data Distribution Service
Data Distribution Service for real-time systems (DDS) is a specification of a publish/subscribe middleware for distributed systems created in response to the need to augment CORBA with a data-centric publish-subscribe specification. [1]

[edit] Model Driven Architecture
OMG evolved towards modeling standards by creating the standard for Unified Modeling Language (UML) followed by related standards for

Meta-Object Facility (MOF),
XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) and
MOF Query/Views/Transformation (QVT).

These together provide the foundation for Model Driven Architecture (MDA), and related set of standards, building upon the success of UML and MOF.
Systems Modeling Language (SysML), a modeling language based on UML for use in Systems Engineering, has been standardized in collaboration with INCOSE.
Significant progress has also been made in bringing the world of UML modeling and the Semantic Web together through the adoption of the Ontology Definition Metamodel which relates UML models in a standard way with RDF and Web Ontology Language (OWL) models.
Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) is a landmark for the OMG, the first OMG specification to incorporate the formal use of natural language in modeling and the first to provide explicitly a model of formal logic. Based on a fusion of linguistics, logic, and computer science, and two years in preparation, SBVR provides a way to capture specifications in natural language and represent them in formal logic so they can be machine-processed. SBVR is an integral part of MDA.

[edit] Architecture Driven Modernization
Architecture Driven Modernization (ADM} is the reverse of MDA. It also means Architecture Driven Modernization. ADMTF is an OMG group similar to ADTF with high potential.
Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM), a common intermediate representation for existing software systems and their operating environments. Knowledge Discovery Metamodel is designed as the OMG's foundation for software modernization and software assurance. Knowledge Discovery Metamodel uses Meta-Object Facility to define an XMI interchange format between tools that work with existing software and an abstract interface for the next-generation assurance and modernization tools.
Abstract Syntax Tree Metamodel (ASTM), a modeling language for fine grained reverse engineering.
Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) and KDM are designed as two parts of a unique OMG Technology Stack for software analytics related to existing software systems. KDM defines an ontology related to software artifacts and thus provides an initial formalization of the information related to a software system. SBVR is further used to formalize complex compliance rules related to the software.

[edit] Domain models

Business models : OMG manages a number of standards for business modeling, including BPMN, the Business Motivation Model (BMM) and the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) specification.


Verticals : Considerable progress has also been made in developing vertical model-based standards in the healthcare, finance, telecommunications, manufacturing, software-defined radio, space/ground systems communications and some dozen other technology areas.


[edit] Software assurance and regulatory compliance
New activities have been initiated to address important concerns of Regulatory Compliance and Software Assurance, building upon the base standards of MDA.

[edit] Certification
OMG offers three professional certifications:

OCRES - OMG Certified Real-time and Embedded Systems Specialist[2]
OCUP - OMG Certified UML Professional[3]
OCEB - OMG Certified Expert in Business Process Management (BPM)[4]
