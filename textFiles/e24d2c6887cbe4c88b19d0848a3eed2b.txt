[edit] Notes

The filetypes that can be displayed by GQView depends on the image-processing libraries (libjpeg, libpng, etc.) installed on the operating system.
Prices will vary over time, and between suppliers, and are for approximate indication only
iPhoto is part of iLife, which includes a DVD authoring package (iDVD), a video editor (iMovie), a music player (iTunes), a multimedia web publisher (iWeb), and an audio-sequencing program (GarageBand)
ACDSee supports 61 various image formats and writes to 16. Reads 9 compression formats and writes to 2. Also ACDSee supports 33 Video Formats (Reads)
FastPictureViewer's DirectX hardware acceleration support depends on the actual video card installed and the amount of available video memory. The commercial version also supports previewing some camera RAW formats for which a WIC-enabled codec exists. Such RAW codecs are currently available from Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, Sony and for Adobe DNG.
Picasa has an experimental GNU/Linux version that runs under WINE.
A large majority of Windows based image viewers do not have Unicode support. Some exceptions that do work with Unicode include ExifPro, FastPictureViewer, Imatch and Ashampoo Photo Commander.
SView5 has different functionality under AmigaOS/MorphOS and Windows/.NET since the .NET port has just been started end of 2008.
