George W. Bush.


The term Bushism is a neologism that refers to a number of unconventional words, phrases, pronunciations, malapropisms, and semantic or linguistics errors that have occurred in and defined the public speaking of former United States President George W. Bush and, much less notably, of his father George H. W. Bush, also a former president of the United States.[1][2][3] The term has become part of popular folklore and is the basis of a number of websites and published books. It is often used to caricature the two presidents. Common characteristics include malapropisms, the creation of neologisms, spoonerisms, stunt words, and grammatically incorrect subject-verb agreement.
This occasional misuse of the English language in formal and public speeches has spawned several books that document the statements. The first, Bushisms/President George Herbert Walker Bush in His Own Words, was released in 1992. A poem entitled Make the Pie Higher, composed entirely of Bushisms, was compiled by high school English teacher Dirk Schulze under the pseudonym of Richard Thompson, as an example of a found poem for his students.[4]
