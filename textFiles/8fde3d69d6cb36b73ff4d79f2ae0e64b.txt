[edit] Life and work
Storm Thorgerson was born in Potters Bar, which was in Middlesex at the time and is now in Hertfordshire. He was a key member of the British graphic art group Hipgnosis, and designed many of their most famous single and album covers. Latterly, he runs a design studio called StormStudios - a loose group of freelancers. Perhaps his most famous designs are those for Pink Floyd.[1] His design for Dark Side of the Moon has been called one of the greatest album covers of all time, and is without a doubt one of the most iconic.[2] Many of his designs are notable for their surreal elements. He often places objects out of their traditional contexts, especially with vast spaces around them, to give them an awkward appearance while highlighting their beauty. To quote Thorgerson, "I like photography because it is a reality medium, unlike drawing which is unreal. I like to mess with reality...to bend reality. Some of my works beg the question of is it real or not?"[3] Several books have been devoted to surveying Thorgerson's work over three-plus decades.
