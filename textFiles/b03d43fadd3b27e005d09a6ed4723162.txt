[edit] History
The song Bella Ciao was sung by the left anti-fascist resistance movement in Italy, a movement by anarchists, communists, socialists and other anti-fascist partisans. The author of the lyrics is unknown, and the music seems to come from an earlier folk song sung by riceweeders in the Po Valley. Another interpretation has been given following the discovery in 2006 by Fausto Giovannardi of the CD "Klezmer - Yiddish swing music" including the melody "Koilen" played in 1919 by Mishka Ziganoff.[1]

[edit] Lyrics
Note: rhymes could not be rendered in English, and several short Italian words (bella, ciao) translate into long English words (beautiful, goodbye), so that the result is rather "heavier" than the original version. Also, there are several verses which differ in the Italian version, i.e. different ways to sing those verses. Those are written in brackets.






Italian lyrics


Una mattina mi son svegliato,
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
Una mattina mi son svegliato,
e ho trovato l'invasor.


O partigiano, portami via,
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
O partigiano, portami via,
ché mi sento di morir.


E se io muoio da partigiano,
(E se io muoio sulla montagna)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
E se io muoio da partigiano,
(E se io muoio sulla montagna)
tu mi devi seppellir.


E seppellire lassù in montagna,
(E tu mi devi seppellire)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
E seppellire lassù in montagna,
(E tu mi devi seppellire)
sotto l'ombra di un bel fior.


Tutte le genti che passeranno,
(E tutti quelli che passeranno)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
Tutte le genti che passeranno,
(E tutti quelli che passeranno)
Mi diranno «Che bel fior!»
(E poi diranno «Che bel fior!»)


«È questo il fiore del partigiano»,
(E questo è il fiore del partigiano)
o bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!
«È questo il fiore del partigiano,
(E questo è il fiore del partigiano)
morto per la libertà!»






English translation


One morning I awakened
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
One morning I awakened
And I found the invader


Oh partisan carry me away
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
Oh partisan carry me away
Because I feel death approaching


And if I die as a partisan
(And if I die on the mountain)
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
And if I die as a partisan
(And if I die on the mountain)
Then you must bury me


Bury me up in the mountain
(And you have to bury me)
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
Bury me up in the mountain
(And you have to bury me)
Under the shade of a beautiful flower


And the people who shall pass
(And all those who shall pass)
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
And the people who shall pass
(And all those who shall pass)
Will tell me: "what a beautiful flower"
(And they will say: "what a beautiful flower")


This is the flower of the partisan
(And this is the flower of the partisan)
Oh Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful, Goodbye beautiful! Bye! Bye!
This is the flower of the partisan
(And this is the flower of the partisan)
Who died for freedom





[edit] Alternate translation
Alternate, less literal and more "singable" translation - which also makes explicit some aspects that are left implicit in the Italian text:

SWEETHEART GOODBYE


One morning when I awakened
Sweetheart goodbye, oh goodbye, oh goodbye-bye-bye!
One morning when I awakened
I found invaders all around


Oh partisan, come take me with you
Sweetheart goodbye, oh goodbye, oh goodbye-bye-bye!
Oh partisan, come take me with you
Because I feel ready to die


If I die fighting as a partisan
Sweetheart goodbye, oh goodbye, oh goodbye-bye-bye!
If I die fighting as a partisan
You must come and bury me


Bury me there, up in the mountains
Sweetheart goodbye, oh goodbye, oh goodbye-bye-bye!
Bury me there, up in the mountains
Shade my grave with a lovely flower


So all the people who pass that way
Sweetheart goodbye, oh goodbye, oh goodbye-bye-bye!
So all the people who pass that way
Will say "Oh see that lovely flower! - "


"Ah that's the flower of the partisan fighter - "
Sweetheart goodbye, oh goodbye, oh goodbye-bye-bye!
"Ah that's the flower of the partisan fighter
who died for freedom's sake!"


[edit] International versions
The song has been recorded by various artists in many different languages including Italian, Russian, Bosnian, Kurdish, Croatian, Serbian, Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Finnish, Kabyle, German, Turkish, Japanese, Tagalog, Breton and Chinese.
The song is sung in a slightly different manner by Norwegian socialists. This Norwegian version describes the oppression of workers on the rice fields, and speaks of the freedom to come.
Bella Ciao is the end theme song for the Yugoslav WWII movie Most (The Bridge, The Savage Bridge).
A rewritten version of the song can be heard on Chumbawamba's acoustic album "A Singsong and a Scrap".
Another version of the song was recorded by the punk rock band Dog Faced Hermans [1] on the album "Every Day Time Bomb."
Former Yugoslav punk rock bands KUD Idijoti and later Goblini recorded their versions of the track.
The German hip-hop group Chaoze One has recorded an electronic version of the song with opera singing on their album "Neue Kreise."
Renowned filk musician Leslie Fish has written and performed several versions of the song, one of which can be found on the album "Smoked Fish".
