Life
Dahmer was born in West Allis, Wisconsin, to Lionel, an analytical chemist, and Joyce Dahmer. Seven years later his brother David was born.[1]. When he was eight years old, he moved with his family to Bath, Ohio, where he attended Revere High School. Dahmer's early childhood was normal, but between the ages of ten and fifteen he grew more and more withdrawn and uncommunative, showing little interests in any hobbies or social interactions.[2]. Instead of normal activities Dahmer became more and more interested in dead things. He biked around his neighborhood looking for dead animals, which he dissected at home, going so far as to put a dog's head on a stake.[3] Dahmer began drinking in his teens and was a full-blown alcoholic by the time of his high-school graduation.[4]
In 1977 Lionel and Joyce Dahmer divorced.[5] Dahmer attended Ohio State University, but dropped out after one quarter, having failed to attend most of his classes.[6] He spent most of his time there drunk.[7] Dahmer's father then forced him to enlist in the Army.[8] His son did well at first,[9] but after only two years Jeff Dahmer was discharged due to his alcoholism.[10] When the Army discharged Dahmer in 1981, it provided him with a plane ticket to anywhere in the country. Dahmer told police he couldn't go home to face his father, so he headed to Miami Beach, Florida, because he was "tired of the cold".[11] He spent most of his time there at a hospital but was kicked out shortly after for drinking.[11] After coming home he continued to drink heavily, and he was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct later in 1981.[12]
In 1982 Dahmer moved in with his grandmother in West Allis, Wisconsin,[13] where he lived for six years.[14] During this time his behavior grew stranger and stranger. Once his grandmother found a fully dressed male mannequin in his closet; Dahmer had stolen it from a store.[15] On another occasion she found a .357 Magnum under his bed.[16] Terrible smells came from the basement; Dahmer told his father that he'd brought home a dead squirrel and dissolved it with chemicals.[17] He was arrested twice for indecent exposure, in 1982 and 1986;[18] the second time came after he masturbated in front of two boys.[19]
In the summer of 1988 Dahmer's grandmother asked him to move out because of his late nights, his strange behavior, and the foul smells from the basement. He then found an apartment on Milwaukee's West side, closer to his job at the Ambrosia Chocolate Factory.[20] On September 26, 1988, one day after moving into his apartment, he was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy in Milwaukee named Somsack Sinthasomphone.[21]. He was sentenced to five years probation and one year in a work release camp. He was required to register as a sex offender.[22] Dahmer was paroled from the work release camp two months early, and he soon moved into a new apartment.[23] Shortly thereafter he began a string of murders that would end with his arrest in 1991.

Murders
Jeffrey Dahmer's first murder was in the summer of 1978. While still living in his father's house, Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Hicks, took him home, and bludgeoned him to death with a barbell after sex. Dahmer buried the body in the backyard.[24] Nine years would pass until Dahmer claimed his next victim, Steven Tuomi.[25] After the Tuomi murder, Dahmer would continue to kill sporadically; two more murders in 1988, another in early 1989, usually picking up his victims in gay bars and having sex with them before killing them.[26] He kept the skull of that victim, Anthony Sears, until he was caught.[27]
In May of 1990, he moved out of his grandmother's house for the last time and into the apartment that would later become infamous: Apartment 213, 924 North 25th Street, Milwaukee. Dahmer picked up the pace of his killing: four more murders before the end of 1990, two more in February and April of 1991, another in May 1991,[28], and then the Sinthasomphone incident.
In the early morning hours of May 30, 1991, 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone (by bizarre chance, the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had molested) was discovered on the street, wandering naked, heavily under the influence of drugs and bleeding from his rectum. Two young women from the neighborhood found the dazed boy and called 911. Dahmer chased his victim down and tried to take him away, but the women stopped him.[29] Dahmer told police that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, and that they had an argument while drinking. Against the protests of the two women who had called 911, police turned him over to Dahmer. They later reported smelling a strange scent while inside Dahmer's apartment but did not investigate it. The smell was the body of Anthony Hughes, Dahmer's previous victim, decomposing in the bedroom. The two policemen failed to run a background check which would have revealed that Dahmer was a convicted sex offender and child molester still under probation.[30] The officers laughed about the incident, one joking that his partner was "going to get deloused."[31] Later that night, Dahmer killed and dismembered Sinthasomphone, keeping his skull as a souvenir.
John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish, two of the three police officers who returned Sinthasomphone to Dahmer, were fired from the Milwaukee Police Department after their actions were widely publicized, including an audiotape of the officers making homophobic statements to their dispatcher and cracking jokes about having reunited the "lovers". The two officers appealed their termination and were reinstated with back pay. They were named officers of the year by the police union. Balcerzak would go on to be elected president of the Milwaukee Police Association in May 2005.[32][33]
By the summer of 1991, Dahmer was murdering approximately one person each week. He killed Matt Turner on June 30, Jeremiah Weinberger on July 5, Oliver Lacy on July 12, and finally Joseph Brandehoft on July 18. Dahmer got the idea that he could create "zombies" of his victims, and attempted to do so by drilling holes into their skulls and injecting hydrochloric acid into their brains.[34] Other residents of the Oxford Apartments complex noticed terrible smells coming from Apartment 213, as well as the thumps of falling objects and the occasional buzzing of a power saw.[35]

Arrest
On July 22, 1991 Dahmer lured another man, Tracy Edwards, into his home. According to the would-be victim, Dahmer struggled with Edwards in order to handcuff him, and ultimately failed to cuff his wrists together.[36] Wielding a large butcher knife, Dahmer forced Edwards into the bedroom, where Edwards saw pictures of mangled bodies on the wall and noticed the terrible smell coming from a large blue barrel.[37] Eventually, when Dahmer took his eyes off of Edwards, Edwards punched him in the face, kicked him in the stomach, ran for the door and escaped Apartment 213.[38] Running through the streets, with the handcuffs still hanging from one hand, Edwards waved for help to a police car driven by Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller of the Milwaukee police department.[39] Edwards led police back to Dahmer's apartment, where Dahmer at first acted friendly to the officers. However, Edwards remembered that the knife Dahmer had threatened him with was in the bedroom. One of the officers did what officers Balcerzak and Gabrish failed to do, and checked the bedroom. He saw the photographs of mangled bodies, and called for his partner to arrest Dahmer.[40] As one officer subdued Dahmer the other opened the refrigerator and found a human head. Further searching of the apartment revealed three more severed heads, multiple photographs of murdered victims and human remains, severed hands and penises, and photographs of dismembered victims and human remains in his refrigerator.[41]
The story of Dahmer's arrest and the inventory in his apartment quickly gained notoriety: several corpses were stored in acid-filled vats, and implements for the construction of an altar of candles and human skulls were found in his closet. Accusations soon surfaced that Dahmer had practiced necrophilia and cannibalism. Seven skulls were found in the apartment.[42] A human heart was in the freezer.[43]

Trial
Jeffrey Dahmer was officially indicted on 17 murder charges, which were reduced to 15. The murder cases were already so notorious that the authorities never bothered to charge him in the attempted murder of Edwards. His trial began on January 30, 1992.[44] With evidence overwhelmingly against him, Dahmer pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.[45] The trial lasted two weeks.[46] The court found Dahmer sane and guilty on 15 counts of murder and sentenced him to 15 life terms,[47] totaling 957 years in prison.[48] At his sentencing hearing Dahmer expressed remorse for his actions, also saying that he wished for his own death. In May of that year, Dahmer was extradited to Ohio, where he entered a plea of guilty for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks.[49]

Imprisonment and death
Dahmer served his time at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, where he ultimately declared himself a born-again Christian. This conversion occurred after viewing evangelical material sent to him by his father.[50] A local preacher from the Churches of Christ, Roy Ratcliff, met with Dahmer and agreed to baptize him.[51]
After attending a church service in the prison chapel an inmate tried to slash Dahmer's throat with a razor blade. Dahmer escaped the incident with superficial wounds.
On November 28, 1994, Dahmer and another inmate named Jesse Anderson were severely beaten by fellow inmate Christopher Scarver with a bar from a weight machine while on work detail in the prison gym. Dahmer died of severe head trauma while on his way to the hospital, in an ambulance.[52]

Aftermath
After the murders the Oxford Apartments at 924 North 25th Street were demolished; the site is now a vacant lot. Plans to convert the site into a memorial garden failed to materialize.
In 1994, Lionel Dahmer published a book, A Father's Story, and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims and their families. Most of the families showed support for Lionel Dahmer and his wife, Shari. He has retired and resides with his wife in Medina County, Ohio. Lionel Dahmer is an advocate for creationism, and his wife was a member of the board of the Medina County Ohio Horseman's Council.[53] Both continue to carry the name Dahmer and say they love Jeffrey despite his crimes. Lionel Dahmer's first wife, Joyce (Flint), died of cancer in 2000 at the age of 64. She was later buried in Atlanta, Georgia. Dahmer's younger brother David changed his last name and lives in anonymity.
Dahmer's estate was awarded to the families of 11 of Dahmer's victims who had sued for damages. In 1996 Thomas Jacobson, the lawyer representing eight of the families, announced a planned auction of Dahmer's estate to raise up to $1 million, sparking controversy.[54][55] A civic group, Milwaukee Civic Pride, was quickly established in an effort to raise the funds to purchase and destroy Dahmer's possessions. The group pledged $407,225 including a $100,000 gift by Milwaukee real estate developer Joseph Zilber for purchase of Dahmer's estate; five of the eight families represented by Jacobson agreed to the terms and Dahmer's possessions were destroyed.[56][57]
In January 2007, evidence surfaced potentially linking Dahmer to Adam Walsh's 1981 abduction and murder in Florida.[11] However Adam's father, John Walsh, believed that another serial killer, Ottis Toole, committed the crime.[58] When interviewed about Adam Walsh in the early 1990s Dahmer repeatedly denied involvement in the crime.[11] In 2008 Florida police declared the Walsh case closed, naming Toole, who died in prison in 1996, as the killer.[59]

Media portrayals

The movie Jeffrey Dahmer: The Secret Life was released in 1993, starring Carl Crew as Dahmer.
In 2002, the biopic Dahmer, starring Jeremy Renner in the title role, premiered in Dahmer's hometown. The film, which portrayed Dahmer in a somewhat sympathetic light, met with protest from the victims' families and quickly went to video.[citation needed]
Joyce Carol Oates' novel Zombie was based on Dahmer's life.[61]
