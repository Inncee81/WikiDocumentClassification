Clock rates:

5 MHz with 0.33 MIPS
8 MHz with 0.66 MIPS

Addressable memory 1 megabyte
Up to 10X the performance of 8080 (typically lower)

Used segment registers to access more than 64 KB of data at once, which many programmers complained made their work excessively difficult.

Identical in design to 486DX but without math coprocessor. The first version was an 80486DX with disabled mathco in the chip and different pin configuration. If the user needed math co capabilities, he must add 487SX which was actually an 486DX with different pin configuration to prevent the user from installing a 486DX instead of 487SX, so with this configuration 486SX+487SX you had 2 identical CPU's with only 1 turned on)
