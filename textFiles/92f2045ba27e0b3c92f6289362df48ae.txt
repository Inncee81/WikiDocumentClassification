The A. M. Turing Award is given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community. The contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field".[1] Often recognized as the "Nobel Prize of computing",[1] the award is named after Alan Mathison Turing, a British mathematician who is "frequently credited for being the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence".[2] As of 2007, the award is accompanied by a prize of $250,000, co-sponsored by Intel and Google.[1]
The first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, then of Carnegie Institute of Technology. Frances E. Allen of IBM, in 2006, was the first female recipient in the award's forty year history.[3][4][5] The 2008 award also went to a woman, Barbara Liskov.
The award recipients and the fields in which they earned the recognition are listed below. Refer to the individual recipients for more detailed information on their achievements.

Maurice V. Wilkes
Professor Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. Built in 1949, the EDSAC used a mercury delay line memory. He is also known as the author, with Wheeler and Gill, of a volume on "Preparation of Programs for Electronic Digital Computers" in 1951, in which program libraries were effectively introduced


1968

For his work on numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes


1969

artificial intelligence


1970
James H. Wilkinson
For his research in numerical analysis to facilitate the use of the high-speed digital computer, having received special recognition for his work in computations in linear algebra and "backward" error analysis


1971
John McCarthy
Dr. McCarthy's lecture "The Present State of Research on Artificial Intelligence" is a topic that covers the area in which he has achieved considerable recognition for his work


1972
Edsger W. Dijkstra
Edsger Dijkstra was a principal contributor in the late 1950's to the development of the ALGOL, a high level programming language which has become a model of clarity and mathematical rigor. He is one of the principal proponents of the science and art of programming languages in general, and has greatly contributed to our understanding of their structure, representation, and implementation. His fifteen years of publications extend from theoretical articles on graph theory to basic manuals, expository texts, and philosophical contemplations in the field of programming languages


1973
Charles W. Bachman
For his outstanding contributions to database technology


1974
Donald E. Knuth
For his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, and in particular for his contributions to "The Art of Computer Programming" through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title


1975
Allen Newell and
Herbert A. Simon
In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years, initially in collaboration with J. C. Shaw at the RAND Corporation, and subsequentially with numerous faculty and student colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University, they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing


1976
Michael O. Rabin and
Dana S. Scott
For their joint paper "Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem," which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an enormously valuable concept. Their (Scott & Rabin) classic paper has been a continuous source of inspiration for subsequent work in this field


1977
John Backus
For profound, influential, and lasting contributions to the design of practical high-level programming systems, notably through his work on FORTRAN, and for seminal publication of formal procedures for the specification of programming languages


1978
Robert W. Floyd
For having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of parsing, the semantics of programming languages, automatic program verification, automatic program synthesis, and analysis of algorithms


1979
Kenneth E. Iverson
For his pioneering effort in programming languages and mathematical notation resulting in what the computing field now knows as APL, for his contributions to the implementation of interactive systems, to educational uses of APL, and to programming language theory and practice


1980
C. Antony R. Hoare
For his fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages


1981
Edgar F. Codd
For his fundamental and continuing contributions to the theory and practice of database management systems, esp. relational databases


1982
Stephen A. Cook
For his advancement of our understanding of the complexity of computation in a significant and profound way


1983
Ken Thompson and Dennis M. Ritchie
For their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system


1984
Niklaus Wirth
For developing a sequence of innovative computer languages, EULER, ALGOL-W, MODULA and PASCAL


1985
Richard M. Karp
For his continuing contributions to the theory of algorithms including the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions to the theory of NP-completeness


1986
John Hopcroft and
Robert Tarjan
For fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures


1987
John Cocke
For significant contributions in the design and theory of compilers, the architecture of large systems and the development of reduced instruction set computers (RISC)


1988
Ivan Sutherland
For his pioneering and visionary contributions to computer graphics, starting with Sketchpad, and continuing after


1989
William (Velvel) Kahan
For his fundamental contributions to numerical analysis. One of the foremost experts on floating-point computations. Kahan has dedicated himself to "making the world safe for numerical computations."


1990
Fernando J. Corbat√≥
For his pioneering work organizing the concepts and leading the development of the general-purpose, large-scale, time-sharing and resource-sharing computer systems, CTSS and Multics.


1991
Robin Milner
For three distinct and complete achievements: 1) LCF, the mechanization of Scott's Logic of Computable Functions, probably the first theoretically based yet practical tool for machine assisted proof construction; 2) ML, the first language to include polymorphic type inference together with a type-safe exception-handling mechanism; 3) CCS, a general theory of concurrency. In addition, he formulated and strongly advanced full abstraction, the study of the relationship between operational and denotational semantics.
