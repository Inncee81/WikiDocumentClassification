JACK Audio Connection Kit




Latest release
1.9.2 / 23 March 2009


Operating system
Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X


Type
Sound server


License
GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License


Website
http://jackaudio.org/


The JACK Audio Connection Kit or JACK is a sound server daemon that provides low latency connections between so-called jackified applications, for both audio and MIDI data. It is created by Paul Davis and others. The server is licensed under the GNU GPL, while the library is licensed under the GNU LGPL.
JACK can use ALSA, PortAudio, CoreAudio, FreeBoB, FFADO and (still experimental) OSS as its back-end. As of 2008 it runs on Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Another implementation of jack, called JACKDMP, supports Windows as well. JACKDMP was recently renamed JACK 1.9, and will eventually become JACK 2.

[edit] Applications
Some software that works with JACK:

Aqualung – a GTK based music player
Ardour – a free digital audio workstation program for Linux and OS X.
Audacity[1]
Baudline – a signal analysis tool
CheeseTracker – an Impulse Tracker clone
ChucK – a real-time audio programming language
Freqtweak – a digital EQ
Hydrogen – an advanced drum machine
jaaa – audio signal generator and spectrum analyser [2]
japa – a 'perceptual' or 'psychoacoustic' audio spectrum analyser. [3]
MusE – a Qt-based MIDI/audio sequencer
Music Player Daemon – what the name says. A daemon that runs in the background and plays music.
Pure data – a graphical programming language for multimedia
qjackctl – a Qt based tool to control JACK
Renoise – a contemporary DAW/tracker.
Rosegarden – a free digital audio workstation program for Linux
SuperCollider – a real-time audio programming language
XMMS – a free music player for X11
XMMS2 – client/server based redesign of XMMS
ZynAddSubFX – an opensource software synthesizer
MOC – A ncurses based music player

As of 2007, there are many applications with JACK support; every well known video player supports JACK as audio output, and nearly every audio playing application for Linux supports JACK output.

[edit] Libraries

Allegro - a game programming library
bio2jack - a library that allows for simple porting of blocked I/O (bio) OSS/ALSA audio applications to JACK
