[edit] Plot





The plot summary in this article is too long or detailed compared to the rest of the content. Please edit the article to focus on discussing the work rather than merely reiterating the plot. (October 2008)


Max Cohen, the story's main character and occasional narrator is a number theorist who believes that everything in nature can be understood through numbers, and that if you graph the numbers properly patterns will emerge. He is working on finding predictable patterns within the stock market, using its many variables as his data set with the assistance of his homemade supercomputer, Euclid. He is shown to be capable of doing complex arithmetic calculations in his head when a young girl asks him to solve a huge problem for her and verifies the answer on her calculator. Max also suffers from chronic headaches, as well as extreme paranoia (possibly paranoid schizophrenia), manifested in menacing hallucinations, and a crippling form of social anxiety disorder.
In the course of his work, Max begins making stock predictions based on Euclid's calculations. In the middle of printing out the picks, Euclid suddenly crashes, but first spits out a 216-digit number that appears to be nothing more than a random string, as well as a single pick at one-tenth its current value. Disgusted, Max tosses out the printout of the number. The next morning, Max checks the financial pages and sees that the few picks Euclid made before crashing were accurate following a huge tech stock plunge. He searches desperately for the printout but cannot find it. Other than a woman living on his block who sometimes speaks to him, the only social interaction Max seems to have is with Sol Robeson, his old mathematics mentor, who regards Max as his prize student. He sympathizes with Max about the loss of Euclid but becomes unnerved when Max mentions the string of numbers, asking if the string was 216 digits long. When Max questions him about the string, Sol indicates that he came across such a number many years ago. He urges Max to slow down and try taking a break.
At a coffee shop, Max meets Lenny Meyer, a Hasidic Jew who coincidentally does mathematical research on the Torah. Lenny demonstrates some simple Gematria to Max and explains how some people believe that the Torah is a string of numbers that form a code sent by God. Max takes an interest when he realizes that some of the number concepts Lenny discusses are similar to other mathematical concepts, such as the Fibonacci Sequence. Max eventually decides to abandon working on the stock market and assist Lenny.
Max is also being pursued by agents of a Wall Street firm, who are interested in his work for financial reasons. One of the agents, Marcy Dawson, offers Max a powerful new computer chip called "Ming Mecca" in exchange for the results of his work, which Max accepts.
Utilizing the sophisticated chip, Max has Euclid analyze mathematical patterns in the Torah. Euclid crashes again, but once again spits out the 216-digit number. When his computer refuses to print out the number, Max begins to write it down. Midway through the writing, Max realizes that he knows the pattern, undergoes a sudden, intense moment of self-realization, and passes out. Thereafter, Max appears to become clairvoyant and able to visualize the stock market patterns he had been searching for. His headaches also increase in intensity, and he discovers a strange vein-like bulge protruding from his right temple. After speaking with Sol again, he leaves digusted after his mentor begs him to quit his work.
Marcy Dawson and her henchmen grab Max on the street, and try to force him to explain the 216-digit number. They had found the original printout and were trying to use it to manipulate the stock market to their own ends; however, their lack of comprehension regarding the number had led them to unwittingly crash the stock market. Although Max is held by Marcy's people at gunpoint, Lenny drives by and rescues him. However, soon, Lenny and his companions makes similar demands on Max to give them the number. They finally reveal their intentions: they believe the number was meant for them to bring about the Messianic Age, as the number represents the unspeakable name of God. Max refuses, insisting that whatever the source of the number, it has been revealed to him alone.
Max flees, and visits Sol again, only to find that he has since died of a second stroke. Max searches his house and finds mathematical scribblings similar to the kind Max himself had written. On a Go board, with its pieces arranged in a spiral, Max finds a piece of paper with the 216-digit number. He returns to his apartment.
Driven to the brink of madness, Max experiences another headache and resists the urge to take his pain medication. Believing that the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through the pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision breaks with Max hugging his beautiful female neighbor, which turns out to be an illusion. Max is standing alone, clutching himself in his trashed apartment. Giving up, Max burns the paper with the number and trepans himself in the right temple with a power drill. Later, Max sits on a park bench and watches the trees blowing in the breeze, at peace. When the girl with the calculator comes to visit him and begins asking math problems, he smiles and tells her he doesn't know.

[edit] Cast




Sean Gullette as Maximillian Cohen



Sean Gullette as Maximillian Cohen, a reclusive math genius
Mark Margolis as Sol Robeson, Max's mentor, who abandoned his research into π after it nearly killed him.

[edit] Production
π was written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, and filmed on high-contrast black-and-white reversal film.
π had a low budget ($60,000), but proved a financial success at the box office ($3.2 million gross in the U.S.) despite only a limited release to theaters. It has sold steadily on DVD.

[edit] Reception
The general critical reception has been good. On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie is rated 83% based on 42 reviews. On Metacritic, the movie has a rating of 72 (generally favourable reviews) out of 100 based on 23 reviews.

[edit] Mathematics and π

π features several references to mathematics and mathematical theories. For instance, Max finds the golden spiral occurring everywhere, including the stock market. Max's belief that diverse systems embodying highly nonlinear dynamics share a unifying pattern bears much similarity to results in chaos theory, which provides machinery for describing certain phenomena of nonlinear systems, which might be thought of as patterns. Unlike in the film, chaos theory does not allow one to predict the exact behavior of a chaotic system like the stock market and, in fact, provides compelling evidence that such predictions are, in principle, impossible.
The film's duration is exactly 1:23:45.

[edit] Kabbalah and π

The 216-letter name of God sought by the characters of the film is actually widely known and called the Sheim HaMeforash or the Explicit Name. It comes from Exodus 14:19-21. Each of these three verses is composed of seventy-two letters in the original Hebrew. If one writes the three verses in boustrophedon form — one above the other, the first from right to left, the second from left to right, and the third from right to left — one gets seventy-two columns of three-letter names of God. The seventy-two names are divided into four columns of eighteen names each. Each of the four columns represents one of the four letters of the Tetragrammaton.
The actual name of God, according to Jewish traditions, is the Tetragrammaton (YHWH or YHVH). This is the name that was intoned in the temple three times during the singular day of Yom Kippur, as referenced in the film. What has been lost is not the spelling of the name, as in the film, but the true pronunciation, since words written in Hebrew in the Torah do not include vowels. Furthermore, in the case of the Tetragrammaton, when vowels were used, the actual vowels were replaced with the vowels of the word Adonai to avoid pronouncing the Tetragrammaton, which is avoided in Judaism; hence the common, but mistaken, pronunciation of YHVH as Jehova.
In addition, it would be highly unlikely that the Hebrew Shem HaMeforash would translate into 216 digits in a decimal system for several reasons:

There is no zero in Hebrew numerals.
The Hebrew number system is non-positional.


[edit] The game of Go
In the film, Max periodically plays Go with his mentor, Sol.[1] This game has historically stimulated the study of mathematics[2] and features a simple set of rules that results in a complex game strategy. The two characters each use the game as a model for their view of the universe; Sol says that the game is a microcosm of an extremely complex and chaotic world, while Max asserts that patterns can be found in the complexity of its variations.[1][nb 1]
Actors Sean Gullette and Mark Margolis both spent many hours learning the game at the Brooklyn Go Club, and had the help of a Go consultant for the film.[1] As a result, the portrayal of the game in the film is fairly accurate, although some of the moves played by the actors are seemingly random, and the way Max holds his Go stones is amateurish.[3]

[edit] Footnotes


^ SOL: Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board to be a microcosm of the universe. Although when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered, in fact, the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern. MAX: But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable. SOL: So? MAX: So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order...a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number.
