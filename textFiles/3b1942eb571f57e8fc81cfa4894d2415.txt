American Psychological Association (APA) style is a widely accepted style of documentation, particularly in the social sciences. APA style specifies the names and order of headings, formatting, and organization of citations and references, and the arrangement of tables, figures, footnotes, and appendices, as well as other manuscript and documentation features. APA style uses the author-date style of parenthetical referencing, with such source citations keyed to a subsequent list of "References." The APA Publication Manual provides basic guidelines for documenting both print and electronic resources. The section on electronic resources is updated and supplemented by the 2007 APA Style Guide to Electronic References (PDF).

[edit] Sections and subsections
An APA style paper typically has the following sections, each of which starts on a new page.

Title Page
Abstract
Body
References
Footnotes
Tables (new page for each table)
Figure captions
Figures (new page for each figure)


[edit] Headings

Level 1: Centered Uppercase and Lowercase Heading
Level 2: Ideal Institute of Technology
Level 3: Engineering college
Level 4: Indented, italicized, lowercase paragraph heading ending with a period.
Level 5: CENTERED UPPERCASE HEADING[1]


[edit] Citation
Reference citations in text are done using parenthetical referencing. Most usually, this involves enclosing the author's surname and the date of publication within parentheses, separated by a comma, generally placed immediately after the reference or at the end of the sentence in which the reference is made. However, it is also common for the authors to be the subject or object of a sentence. In such a case only the year is in parenthesis. In all cases of citation, author name(s) are always followed immediately by a year, and years are never presented without author name(s) immediately preceding it. In the case of a quotation, the page number is also included in the citation.
Full bibliographic information is then provided in a Reference section at the end of the article. APA style defines that the reference section may only include articles that are cited within the body of an article. This is the distinction between a document having a Reference section and a bibliography, which may incorporate sources which may have been read by the authors as background but not referred to or included in the body of a document.

Single author
Format should be Author's last name (no initials) followed directly by a comma, then the year of publication. When one makes the reference to the author(s) directly as a part of the narrative, then only the year (and page number if needed) would remain enclosed within parentheses. The same holds for multiple authors.


A recent study found a possible genetic cause of alcoholism (Pauling, 2005).


Pauling (2005) discovered a possible genetic cause of alcoholism.


Two authors
Authors should be presented in order that they appear in the published article. If they are cited within closed parentheses, use the ampersand (&) between them. If not enclosed in parentheses then use expanded "and".


A recent study found a possible genetic cause of alcoholism (Pauling & Liu, 2005).


Pauling and Liu (2005) discovered a possible genetic cause of alcoholism.


Three to five authors

With three to five authors, the first reference to an article includes all authors. Subsequent citations in the same document may refer to the article by the principal author only plus "et al." However, all authors must be present in the references section.

A recent study found a possible genetic cause of alcoholism (Pauling, Liu, & Guo, 2005).


Pauling, Liu, and Guo (2005) conducted a study that discovered a possible genetic cause of alcoholism.


Pauling et al. (2005) discovered a possible genetic cause of alcoholism.


A recent study found a possible genetic cause of alcoholism (Pauling et al., 2005).


Six authors or more

The correct format is (First Author et al., Year). In the reference section, all six authors' names should be included.

Pauling et al. (2005) discovered a possible genetic cause of alcoholism.


Multiple publications, same author

If an author has multiple publications that you wish to cite, you use a comma to separate the years of publication in chronological order (oldest to most recent). If the publications occur in the same year, the Publication Manual recommends using suffixes a, b, c, etc. (note that corresponding letters should be used in the reference list, and these references should be ordered alphabetically by title).

Recent studies have found a possible genetic cause of alcoholism (Pauling, 2004, 2005a, 2005b).


Pauling (2004, 2005a, 2005b) has conducted studies that have discovered a possible genetic cause of alcoholism


Multiple publications, different authors

Follow the rules for one author above, and use a semicolon to separate articles. Citation should first be in alphabetical order of the author, then chronological.

Recent studies found a possible genetic cause of alcoholism (Alford, 1995; Pauling, 2004, 2005; Sirkis, 2003)


Direct quotes

The same rules as above apply here, the format being (Author, Year, Page Number).

When asked why his behavior had changed so dramatically, Max simply said, "I think it's the reinforcement" (Pauling, 2004, p. 69).


[edit] Reference list
The APA style guide prescribes that the Reference section, bibliographies and other lists of names should be accumulated by surname first, and mandates inclusion of surname prefixes. For example, "Martin de Rijke" should be sorted as "De Rijke, M." and "Saif Al Falasi" should be sorted as "Al-Falasi, S." (The preference for Arabic names now is to hyphenate the prefix so that it remains with the surname.)

[edit] Statistical expressions in APA
Some of the more common examples are given below. Italics and spaces need to be carefully noted.

Note on Probabilities
There are two ways to report statistical probability: pre-specified probability given as a range below the chosen alpha level and exact probability given as a calculated p-value. Since most statistical packages calculate an exact value for p, the Publication Manual recommends that exact p-values should be reported.

Example: p < .05
Example: p = .031 (preferred)


Exceptions, where a pre-specified probability range may be preferred, include large or complex tables of correlations or when the p-value is particularly small (e.g., p < .001).


Reporting F-tests
General format: F([df-between], [df-within]) = [F-obtained], p = [p-value], [eta-squared obtained] = [value].

Example: F(2, 50) = 9.35, p < .001, η2 = .03.




If a p-value is not significant, then the letters ns are substituted, or the precise p-value is substituted prefaced by an equals sign.

Example: F(2, 50) = 1.35, ns.
Example: F(2, 50) = 1.35, p = .18. (preferred)




If an F-value is less than 1, thereby implying that it can never be statistically significant, then neither the F-value itself, nor the associated p-value, is reported.

Example: F(2, 50) < 1.
Example: F < 1.




Reporting t-tests
General format: t([df error])= [t-obtained], p = [p-value], [Cohen's d obtained] = [value].

Example: t(9) = 2.35, p = .043, d = .70.




Reporting X2 tests
General format: Χ2([df error], N = [total sample size]) = [Chi-squared obtained], p = [p-value].

Example: X2(4, N = 24) = 12.4, p = .015.




[edit] Graph and table layout

Graphs

should not have tick marks for the measures
should have titles for the x and y axis
should not have outline around the graph
should not have minor lines on the chart
The legend should either not exist if the graph is simple or should be inside the chart
need to be on a figure captions page, with an explanation of the data represented
do not have page numbers, and should have penciled in, on the back the top and the figure caption that corresponds to it.


Tables

do have page numbers
do not have vertical lines




[edit] Other non-print sources
No personal communication is included in the reference list; instead, parenthetically cite the communicators name, the fact that it was personal communication, and the date of the communication in your main text only.
(E. Robbins, personal communication, January 4, 2001).
A. P. Smith also claimed that many of her students had difficulties with citation style (personal communication, November 3, 2002).
