[edit] Biography

[edit] Early career
Elfman was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Blossom Elfman (née Bernstein), a writer and teacher, and Milton Elfman, a teacher who was in the Air Force.[1] Elfman grew up in a racially mixed community in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles, where he was known as 'the whitest white kid'.[2] He spent much of his time in the local movie theatre, adoring the music of such film composers as Bernard Herrmann and Franz Waxman.
After dropping out of high school, he followed his brother Richard to France, where he played his violin on the street and performed with Le Grand Magic Circus, an avant-garde musical theater group. Violin in tow, Elfman next journeyed to Africa where he traveled through Ghana, Mali, and Upper Volta, absorbing new musical styles, including the Ghanaian highlife genre which would eventually influence his own music. Elfman contracted malaria during his one-year stay and was often sick. Eventually he returned home to the United States, where his brother was forming a new musical theater group, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. The group performed the music for Richard's debut feature film, Forbidden Zone. Danny Elfman composed his first score for the film and played the role of Satan. By the time the movie was completed, The Mystic Knights had shortened their name to Oingo Boingo and become a recording and touring rock group.

[edit] Personal life
In November 2003, Elfman married actress Bridget Fonda in a private ceremony at Los Angeles' First Congressional Church, with Fonda's father, Peter Fonda, giving her away. The couple reportedly met while working on the film A Simple Plan. They have one son, Oliver, born January 2005. [3]

[edit] Danny Elfman and Tim Burton
In 1985, Tim Burton and Paul Reubens invited Elfman to write the score for their first feature film, Pee-wee's Big Adventure. Elfman was apprehensive at first because of his lack of formal training, but with orchestration assistance from Oingo Boingo guitarist and arranger Steve Bartek he achieved his goal of emulating the mood of such composers as Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann.[4] He later described, in the booklet for the first volume of 'Music for a Darkened Theatre,' that the first time he heard his music played by a full orchestra was one of the most thrilling experiences of his life.[citation needed] Elfman has spoken of the affinity he developed right away with Burton,[4] and he has gone on to score all but two of his major studio films (Ed Wood, which was scored by Howard Shore, and Sweeney Todd, an adaptation of the 1979 Stephen Sondheim Broadway musical for which music already existed).
To date Elfman has scored the following Burton films:

Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) – his first orchestral score.
Beetlejuice (1988)
Batman (1989) – his first large-scale action score.
Edward Scissorhands (1990) – his personal favorite of his own scores.[citation needed]
Batman Returns (1992)
The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) - (which Burton wrote and produced, but did not direct) in which he also performed the singing voice of the lead character (Jack Skellington) and two supporting roles (Barrel, one of Oogie Boogie's three henchmen, and The Clown with the Tear-away Face).
Mars Attacks! (1996)
Sleepy Hollow (1999)
Planet of the Apes (2001)
Big Fish (2003)
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) - in which he also provided the voices for the Oompa-Loompas in the musical numbers.
Corpse Bride (2005) - in which he also performed the role of Bonejangles.
Alice In Wonderland (2010)

Burton has said of Elfman: "We don't even have to talk about the music. We don't even have to intellectualize – which is good for both of us, we're both similar that way. We're very lucky to connect" (Breskin, 1997).

[edit] Musical influences
He recalls that the first time he became aware of film music was in his youth during a screening of The Day the Earth Stood Still (Robert Wise, 1951). The music was by Bernard Herrmann, and that, he has said, was where his love of film music began (Russell and Young, 2000). Elfman purposefully nodded towards Herrmann's The Day the Earth Stood Still score in Tim Burton's sci-fi spoof Mars Attacks!
Other film composers have also proven to be influential, such as Nino Rota and Erich Wolfgang Korngold, the former in Elfman's playful music for Pee-wee's Big Adventure, the latter in his much grander work, Batman. Sometimes his music has a distinctly Russian feel, inspired by the likes of Prokofiev, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky’s ballet music, while his frequent use of choirs reflects his love of choral music by the likes of Mozart and Carl Orff. Jazz and rock influences from his earlier career are evident in such films as Chicago and To Die For.

[edit] Hearing damage
When asked during a 2007 phone-in interview on XETRA-FM if he ever had any notions of performing in an Oingo Boingo reunion, Elfman immediately rejected the idea and stated that in the last few years with the band he had begun to develop significant and irreversible hearing damage as a result of his continuous exposure to the high noise levels involved in performing in a rock band. He went on to say that he believes his hearing damage is partially due to a genetic predisposition to hearing loss, and that he will never return to the stage for fear of worsening the condition.

[edit] Serenada Schizophrana and concert works
Elfman has recently started working in the classical world, beginning with Serenada Schizophrana for the American Composers Orchestra. It was conducted by John Mauceri on its recording and by Steven Sloane at its premiere at Carnegie Hall in New York City on February 23, 2005. After its premiere, it was recorded in studio and released onto SACD on October 3, 2006. The meeting with Mauceri proved fruitful as the composer was encouraged then to write a new concert piece for Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Elfman composed an "overture to a nonexistent musical" and called the piece "The Overeager Overture."
