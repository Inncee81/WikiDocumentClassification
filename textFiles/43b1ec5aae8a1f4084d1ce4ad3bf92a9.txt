Avidemux is a free open-source program designed for multi-purpose video editing and processing. It is written in C/C++, using either the GTK+ or Qt graphics toolkit or a command line interface, and is a platform independent, universal video processing program. It is available for almost all distributions of Linux that are capable of compiling C/C++, GTK+ and the SpiderMonkey ECMAScript scripting engine. A Win32 version of this program is also available for Windows users, as well as Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD ports and packages. The program has also been successfully run under Solaris, though no official packages or binaries exist for it. The program can be run in 64-bit operating systems that are non-Windows and non-Macintosh based.

[edit] Comparison
Avidemux can be compared with VirtualDub (or VirtualDubMod). While it cannot do everything that VirtualDub can, Avidemux can do things that its Windows-only counterpart cannot. It supports OGM, MP4 and Matroska files natively, direct read input for various types of MPEG files, and many other video formats and containers. It offers MPEG editing and requantization. It also has built-in subtitle handling.
Avidemux has often been considered[by whom?] to be an open-source substitute for high-end commercial editors, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, although it does not have as many features. Avidemux's numerous features and functions are comparable to VirtualDub, but it has also been criticized for a poor user interface.[1] Due to Avidemux's multithreading features and native support for AMD 64bit, it was capable of outperforming VirtualDub in certain respects for several years.
Avidemux primarily uses its GUI to perform tasks. This means that it is capable of doing many things that non-GUI users would otherwise have to do using command line tools such as MEncoder or Transcode.

[edit] Features
The straightforward user interface is designed for convenience and speed with simple operations. Features include WYSIWYG cutting, appending, filters and re-encoding into various formats. Some of the filters were ported from MPlayer and Avisynth. Avidemux can also mux and demux audio streams into and out of video files, either through re-encoding or using a direct copy mode.
An integral and important part of the design of the program is its project system, which uses the SpiderMonkey ECMAScript scripting engine. Whole projects with all options, configurations, selections, and preferences can be saved into a project file. Like VirtualDub's vcf scripting capabilities, Avidemux has advanced scripting available for it both in its GUI and command line modes. It also supports a non-project system just like VirtualDub, where you can simply create all your configurations and save the video directly without making a project file. A project queue system is also available.
Avidemux has built-in subtitle processing, both for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to soft subtitle formats (VobSub sub, ass and srt) and various hard subtitle VobSub capabilities. While it is primarily a GUI program, Avidemux can also be run from and through the command line (which can also be used for batch processing and debugging).

[edit] Multithreading
Multithreading has been implemented in the following areas of Avidemux (some partially through libavcodec):

Encoding

H.264/MPEG-4 AVC (using x264)
MPEG-1, MPEG-2 (using libavcodec)
MPEG-4 (SP/ASP, using libavcodec MPEG-4 or Xvid)

Xvid requires the latest version from the CVS




Decoding

MPEG-1, MPEG-2 (using libavcodec)
MPEG-4 (SP/ASP, using libavcodec)




[edit] Credits and information
Avidemux was written from scratch, but additional code from FFmpeg, MPlayer, Transcode, Avisynth, DVD2AVI and other projects has been used on occasion as well. Nonetheless it is a completely stand alone program that does not require any other programs to read, decode, or encode other than itself. The built-in libavcodec library from the FFmpeg project is used for decoding and encoding of various audio and video formats such as MPEG-4 ASP. The primary (though not the only) Avidemux programmer is a person known as Mean, who often frequents the Avidemux forums. The Avidemux project is open to user input and many suggestions from its users have already been implemented as fully-written features.
