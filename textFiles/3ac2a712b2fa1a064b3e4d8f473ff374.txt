Mirabal sisters 25th anniversary of their death stamp.


The Mirabal sisters were four Dominican sisters, three of whom were assassinated by the dictator Rafael Trujillo.

[edit] History
Patria Mercedes Mirabal (February 27, 1924 – November 25, 1960), María Argentina Minerva Mirabal (March 12, 1926 – November 25, 1960) and Antonia María Teresa Mirabal (October 15, 1935 – November 25, 1960) — were citizens of the Dominican Republic who fervently opposed the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo. Bélgica Adela "Dedé" Mirabal-Reyes [1] was not assassinated the day her sisters were. As of 2008, she currently lives in Salcedo, Dominican Republic. She resides in the house where the sisters were born and works to preserve her sisters' memory through the "Museo Hermanas Mirabal" which is also located in Salcedo and was home to the girls for the final ten months of their lives.
The Mirabal women grew up in an upper class, well-cultured environment. All became married family women. The father of the Mirabal sisters was a successful businessman. When Trujillo came to power, their family lost almost all of their fortune. They believed that Trujillo would send their country into economic chaos. Minerva became particularly passionate about ending the dictatorship of Trujillo after talking extensively with an uncle of hers. Influenced by her uncle, Minerva became more involved in the anti-Trujillo movement. Minerva studied law and became a lawyer, but because she did not permit Trujillo's romantic advancements, he ordered that while she would be issued a degree she was not to receive her practitioner's license. Her sisters followed suit, and they eventually formed a group of opponents to the Trujillo regime, known as the Movement of the Fourteenth of June. Inside that group, they were known as "The Butterflies" (Las Mariposas in Spanish). They are known as Las Mariposas because that was the underground name that Minerva was recognized as in political dealings. Two of the sisters, María Argentina Minerva Mirabal and Antonia María Teresa Mirabal, were incarcerated and tortured on several occasions. Three of the sisters' husbands were incarcerated at La Victoria Penitentiary in Santo Domingo.

Despite these setbacks, they persisted in fighting to try to end Trujillo's dictatorship. After the sisters' numerous imprisonments, Trujillo decided to get rid of the sisters. On November 25, 1960, he sent men to intercept the three women after the women had visited their husbands in prison. The unarmed sisters were led into a sugarcane field, then executed along with their driver. Their car was later thrown off of a mountain known as La Cumbre, between the cities of Santiago and Puerto Plata.
Trujillo believed at the time that he had removed a significant problem. Having the three sisters killed backfired, however: the deaths of the Mirabal sisters caused a general public outrage throughout their native country. The resultant publicity of the deaths caused the Dominican Republic to become more interested in the Mirabal sisters and their cause. This public support and awareness contributed to Trujillo's assassination six months later in 1961.

The Mirabal sisters were buried in Ojo de Agua, an area outside the city of Salcedo in Salcedo Province, on the property of their second home where they lived the last ten months of their lives. This home has also been turned into a museum in their honor and is open to the public. There is also a library, bookstore, and souvenir shop located on the property. The three sisters are buried together, and Manolo, Minerva's husband, is also buried with them.

The surviving sister, Dedé, lives near the museum. One of her sons, Jaime David Fernández Mirabal, served as vice-president during Leonel Fernández's first term as president of the republic between the years of 1996 and 2000. Minou Tavarez Mirabal, the eldest daughter of Minerva Mirabal, served as a Congresswoman from 1998 until 2006 and was recently reelected for four additional years (until 2010). 
[edit] Publicity
On December 17, 1999, the United Nations General Assembly designated November 25 (the anniversary of the day of the murder of the Mirabal sisters) as the annual date for the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women in commemoration of the sisters. This day also marks the beginning of the 16 days of Activism against Gender Violence. The end of the 16 Days is December 10, International Human Rights Day.
In 1994, Dominican-American author Julia Álvarez published her novel In the Time of the Butterflies, a fictionalized account of the lives of the Mirabal sisters. The novel was adapted into the 2001 movie In the Time of the Butterflies, starring Salma Hayek as Minerva and Edward James Olmos as Trujillo. Marc Anthony also plays a role in the movie.
The sisters are mentioned in The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007) by Dominican-American novelist Junot Díaz.
The story is fictionalized in the children's book, How the Butterflies Grew Their Wings by Jacob Kushner.
Actress Michelle Rodriguez is currently involved in a film adaptation of the true story of the sisters called Trópico de Sangre, which recently wrapped filming in the Dominican Republic. Rodriguez plays Minerva Mirabal and also co-produces the film with her company Cheshire Kat Productions in association with Kemasi Films. Dedé Mirabal, the real life surviving sister, is participating in the development of the film.[2]
