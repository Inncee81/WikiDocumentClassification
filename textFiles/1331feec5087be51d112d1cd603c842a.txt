This article is about the synthesizer specification.  For the British DJ, see General Midi (DJ).
General MIDI or GM is a standardized specification for music synthesizers that respond to MIDI messages. GM was developed by the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Japan MIDI Standards Committee (JMSC) and first published in 1991. The official specification is available in English from the MMA, bound together with the MIDI 1.0 specification, and in Japanese from the Association of Musical Electronic Industry (AMEI).
GM imposes several requirements beyond the more abstract MIDI 1.0 specification. While MIDI 1.0 by itself provides a protocol which ensures that different instruments can interoperate at a fundamental level (e.g. that pressing keys on a MIDI keyboard will cause an attached MIDI sound module to play musical notes), GM goes further in two ways: it requires that all GM-compatible synthesizers meet a certain minimal set of features, such as being able to play at least 24 notes simultaneously (polyphony), and it attaches specific interpretations to many parameters and control messages which were left under-specified in the MIDI 1.0 spec, such as defining instrument sounds for each of the 128 possible program numbers.
GM synthesizers are required to be able to:

Allow 24 voices to be active simultaneously (including at least 16 melodic and 8 percussive voices)
Respond to note velocity
Support all 16 channels simultaneously (with channel 10 reserved for percussion)
Support polyphony (multiple simultaneous notes) on each channel

[edit] Parameter interpretations
GM Instruments must also obey the following conventions for program and controller events:

[edit] Program change events
In MIDI, the instrument sound or "program" for each of the 16 possible MIDI channels is selected with the Program Change message, which has a Program Number parameter. The following table shows which instrument sound corresponds to each of the 128 possible Program Numbers for GM only. Note that for purposes of computer programming, this table should start at 0 instead of 1 and thus use all of the 7-bit range (0-127) allowed by the MIDI Program Change message. It should also be noted that some MIDI keyboards display these Program Numbers as shown in the table (1-128), whereas others show the range as actually coded in the Program Change message (0-127).

[edit] Percussion notes




GM Standard Drum Map


In GM, MIDI channel 10 is reserved for percussion instruments only. Notes played on channel 10 always produce percussion sounds regardless of any Program Change messages or Program Numbers that may have been sent on channel 10. Each of the 128 different possible note numbers is interpreted as a separate, different instrument, and the percussion sound's pitch is not related to the note number:



35 Bass Drum 2
36 Bass Drum 1
37 Side Stick
38 Snare Drum 1
39 Hand Clap
40 Snare Drum 2
41 Low Tom 2

[edit] Controller events
In MIDI, adjustable parameters for each of the 16 possible MIDI channels may be set with the Control Change message, which has a Control Number parameter and a Control Value parameter. GM also specifies which operations should be performed by several Control Numbers:[1][2]
1 Modulation
6 Data Entry MSB
7 Volume
10 Pan
11 Expression
38 Data Entry LSB
64 Sustain
100 RPN LSB
101 RPN MSB
121 Reset all controllers
123 All notes off

[edit] RPN
GM defines several Registered Parameters, which act like Controllers but are addressed in a different way. In MIDI, every Registered Parameter is assigned a Registered Parameter Number or RPN. Registered Parameters are usually called RPNs for short.
Setting Registered Parameters requires sending (numbers are decimal):

two Control Change messages using Control Numbers 101 and 100 to select the parameter, followed by
any number of Data Entry messages of one or two bytes (MSB = Controller #6, LSB = Controller #38), and finally
an "End of RPN" message

The following global Registered Parameter Numbers (RPNs) are standardised [1] (the parameter is specified by RPN LSB/MSB pair and the value is set by Data Entry LSB/MSB pair):
0,0 Pitch bend range
1,0 Channel Fine tuning
2,0 Channel Coarse tuning
3,0 Tuning Program Change
4,0 Tuning Bank Select
5,0 Modulation Depth Range
127,127 RPN Null
For example: RPN control sequence to set coarse tuning to A440 (parm 2, value 64):
101:0, 100:2, 6:64, 101:127, 100:127

[edit] System Exclusive messages
Two GM System Exclusive ("SysEx") messages are defined: one to enable and disable General MIDI compatibility mode (for synthesizers that also have non-GM modes); and the other to set the synthesizer's master volume.

[edit] GS extensions
Main article: Roland GS
The first GM synthesizer in the Roland Sound Canvas line included a set of proprietary extensions to General MIDI standard. The most notable addition was the ability to address multiple banks of programs (instrument sounds) by using an additional pair of Bank Select controllers to specify up to 65536 'variation' sounds (cc#0 is Bank Select MSB, and cc#32 is Bank Select LSB).
Other most notable features were 9 Drum kits with 14 additional drum sounds each, Control Change messages for controlling the send level of sound effect blocks (cc#91-94), entering additional parameters (cc#98-101), portamento, sostenuto, soft pedal (cc#65-67), and model-specific SysEx messages for setting various parameters of the synth engine.

[edit] General MIDI Level 2
Main article: General MIDI Level 2
In 1999, the official GM standard was updated to include more controllers, patches, RPNs and SysEx messages, in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting and proprietary Roland GS and Yamaha GX additions. Here's a quick overview of the GM2 changes in comparison to GM/GS:

Number of Notes - minimum 32 simultaneous notes
Simultaneous Percussion Kits - up to 2 (Channels 10/11)
Additional 128 melodic sounds are included in variation banks, for a total of 256
9 GS Drum kits are included
Additional Control Change messages

Filter Resonance (Timbre/Harmonic Intensity) (cc#71)
Release Time (cc#72)
Brightness/Cutoff Frequency (cc#74)
Decay Time (cc#75)
Vibrato Rate (cc#76)
Vibrato Depth (cc#77)
Vibrato Delay (cc#78)


Registered Parameter Numbers (RPNs)

Modulation Depth Range (Vibrato Depth Range)


Universal SysEx messages

Master Volume, Fine Tuning, Coarse Tuning
Reverb Type, Time
Chorus Type, Mod Rate, Mod Depth, Feedback, Send to Reverb
Controller Destination Setting
Scale/Octave Tuning Adjust
Key-Based Instrument Controllers
GM2 System On SysEx message



Additional melodic instruments can be accessed by setting CC#32 to 121 and then using CC#0 to select the bank before a Program Change. The most expanded group is Acoustic Pianos.

[edit] General MIDI sound modules
