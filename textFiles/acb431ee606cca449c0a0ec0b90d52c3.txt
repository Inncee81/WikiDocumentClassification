Pentti Linkola


Kaarlo Pentti Linkola (born December 7, 1932 in Helsinki) is a radical Finnish environmentalist, dissident and fisherman. He has written widely about his ideas and is well-known in Finland. He lives a materially very simple life. Nowadays he is on old-age pension, but he still fishes on lake Vanajavesi.
Linkola is a misanthropist[citation needed] who blames humans for the destruction of the environment, and he has promoted ideas such as genocide for saving the environment and to keep the population in control.[citation needed] He strongly promotes deindustrialization.

[edit] Life
Linkola grew up in Helsinki, Finland. His father Kaarlo Linkola was the Rector of Helsinki University and his mother's father Hugo Suolahti had worked as the Chancellor of that same university. Pentti Linkola chose not to continue his zoological and botanical studies after his first year. It has been said that he became a free naturalist.[citation needed] During these years he wrote the Suuri lintukirja ("Great Bird Book") (1955) with Olavi Hilden.
Linkola's first political publication was the pamphlet Isänmaan ja ihmisen puolesta ("For the Fatherland and Human") (1960), in which he spoke strongly for pacifism and encouraged conscientious objection.
Linkola is known for his deep love for birds. In his writings Linkola often expresses his admiring feelings towards forests and nature in general. He advocates the extinction of cats, minks and some other species in Finland that he considers as foreign and destructive to the Finnish nature.

[edit] Ideas
In the essay collection Unelmat paremmasta maailmasta ("Dreams about a Better World") (1971) he explained for the first time his ecological attitudes. He has continued to speak against the modern Western way of life and the overconsumption of natural resources, and his latest books Johdatus 1990-luvun ajatteluun ("Introduction to the Thinking of the 1990s") (1989) and Voisiko elämä voittaa ("Could Life Win") (2004) are collections of his writings that have been published in various Finnish newspapers and magazines.
As a philosopher Linkola can be described as a biocentric empiricist. He demands that man return to a smaller ecological niche and abandon modern technology and the pursuit of economic growth. Sometimes however, he has said that the good society should have high military technology in order to defend itself from being conquered by non-environmental societies. He does not, however, explain how it is feasible to maintain such technology without a modern economy. Linkola considers human population growth the biggest threat to life on Earth. He advocates eugenics and genocide as a means to combat overpopulation. He has admired Stalinist and Nazi massacres, especially The Holocaust where "6 million" died by "ideally painless means".[1]
The book in which he wrote this later received the Eino Leino Award.[2]
He has suggested that big cities should be attacked with nuclear weapons. Linkola has described humans as the cancer of nature.[citation needed] When some particular war has started somewhere in the world, he has often given statements that the war is good since it decreases population.[citation needed]

[edit] Guru status
Pentti Linkola has encountered a lot of opposition to his criticism of the affluent Western society, but he has gained a guru status from some individuals, particularly by the merit of living as he teaches. He doesn't own a car or have running water. He used to earn his living by fishing from a rowing boat and selling the fish from door to door with a horse. He is now entitled to a pension but he continues to fish during wintertime.

^ On "kyettävä fasisminkin uudelleenarviointiin ja tunnustettava se palvelus, minkä tuo filosofia jo 30 vuotta sitten teki vapauttaessaan maapallon kymmenien miljoonien ylensyövien eurooppalaisten kuormituksesta, niistä kuuden miljoonan lähes ihanteellisen kivuttomalla, elinympäristöä haittaamattomalla tavalla" (Translation from Finnish: We even have to be able to re-evaluate the fascism and confess the service that that philosophy made 30 years ago when it freed the earth from the weight of tens of millions of over-nourished Europeans, 6 million of them by ideally painless means, without any damage to the environment") (Pentti Linkola: Toisinajattelijan päiväkirjasta. WSOY 1979)
