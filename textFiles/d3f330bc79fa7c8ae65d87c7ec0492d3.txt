Carved wooden rattleback


A rattleback, also known as an "anagyre", "celt", "Celtic stone", "rebellious celt", "rattlerock", "spin bar", "wobble stone" or "wobblestone" and by the product names "ARK," "Bizzaro Swirls," "RATTLEBACKS," "Space Pet" and "Space Toy," is a semi-ellipsoidal top which will spin on its axis in a preferred direction. But, if spun in the opposite direction, it becomes unstable, "rattles", stops and reverses its spin to the preferred direction.

Behold the mysterious celt,
with a property that amuses.
One way it will spin,
the other way it refuses.












This spin-reversal motion seems, at first sight, to violate the angular-momentum conservation law of physics. Moreover, for most rattlebacks, the motion will happen when the rattleback is spun in one direction, but not when spun in the other. Some exceptional rattlebacks will reverse when spun in either direction. [1] [2] [3] This makes the rattleback a physical curiosity that has excited human imagination since prehistorical times.

[edit] History
Archeologists who investigated ancient Celtic and Egyptian sites in the 19th century found celts which exhibited the spin-reversal motion. The antiquarian word "celt" (the "c" is pronounced as "s") describes adze-, axe-, chisel- and hoe-shaped lithic tools and weapons.
The first modern descriptions of these celts were published in the 1890s when Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker FRS wrote his "On a curious dynamical property of celts" for the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society in Cambridge, England, and "On a dynamical top" for the Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics in Somerville, Mass.
Additional examinations of rattlebacks were published in 1909 and 1918, and by the 1950s and 1970s, several more examinations were made. But, the popular fascination with the objects has increased notably since the 1980s when no fewer than 28 examinations were published.

[edit] Size and Materials
While rattleback artifacts are described as stone with various measurements, most which are sold currently as novelty puzzles and toys are described as plastic with measurements of 3.75-inches length x 0.75-inches width x 0.4375-inches height. Carved wooden rattlebacks are described with a measurement of 5.5-inches to 6-inches length. One plastic rattleback made and sold by Charles W. Sherburne is described with a measurement of 12-inches length. Glass rattlebacks, and those made of spoons[1], are described as being tested with unreported measurements. Larger rattlebacks, and those of other materials, aren't yet reported.
Two rattleback-design types exist. They have either an asymmetrical base where its rolling axis is skewed, or symmetrical base, with off-set weighting at the ends.

[edit] Physics
The spin-reversal motion follows from the growth of instabilities on the other rotation axes, that are rolling (on the main axis) and pitching (on the crosswise axis).




Rolling and pitching motions


When there is an asymmetry in the mass distribution with respect to the plane formed by the pitching and the vertical axes, a coupling of these two instabilities arises; one can imagine how the asymmetry in mass will deviate the rattleback when pitching, which will create some rolling.
The amplified mode will differ depending on the spin direction, which explains the rattleback asymmetrical behavior. Depending on whether it is rather a pitching or rolling instability that dominates, the growth rate will be very high or quite low.
This explains why, due to friction, most rattlebacks exhibit spin-reversal motion only when spun in the pitching-unstable direction, while they slow down and stop spinning before the rolling instability arises when spun in the "stable" direction. Also, after stopping, the spin in the "stable" direction is considerably slower than the original spin speed. Some rattlebacks, however, exhibit "unstable behavior" when spun in either direction, and incur several successive spin reversals per spin.[4]
Other ways to add motion to a rattleback include tapping by pressing down momentarily on either of its ends, and rocking by pressing down repeatedly on either of its ends.

Rattlebacks have been misdescribed and misused as:

A tool of divination - Cyclomancy


Influenced by magic


An expression of the object's Animism


Influenced by the Fourth Dimension


A demonstration of perpetual motion "free energy"


Influenced by Earth's magnetic field


An accurate test of judicial guilt


Influenced by the Coriolis effect
