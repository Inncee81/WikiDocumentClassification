This is a list of emerging technologies. Emerging technologies are new and potentially disruptive technologies, which may marginalize an existing dominant technology.[citation needed]
Only new and potentially disruptive technologies are included in the list. Information technology, for example, has already proven disruptive, whereas artificial intelligence is a subset of information technology with the potential of becoming disruptive in its own right.[citation needed]
Controversy exists over the degree of impact and economic viability of some emerging technologies. There is an ongoing public policy debate over emerging technologies and their implications for society.[citation needed]
This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
