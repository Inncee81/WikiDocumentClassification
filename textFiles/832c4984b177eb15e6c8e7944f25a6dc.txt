[edit] Biography

[edit] Early life
Burt Bacharach was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Irma (née Freeman) and Bert Bacharach, a syndicated newspaper columnist.[3] He is of German Jewish descent.[4] Bacharach studied music at McGill University, the Mannes School of Music, and the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California. His composition teachers included Darius Milhaud, Bohuslav Martinů, and Henry Cowell. After leaving the army Bacharach worked as a pianist, sometimes playing solo and sometimes accompanying singers such as Vic Damone, Polly Bergen, Steve Lawrence, the Ames Brothers and Paula Stewart (who became his first wife). From 1958 to 1961 he was the pianist, arranger and bandleader for Marlene Dietrich, with whom he toured internationally.

[edit] Early songwriting work
In 1957, Bacharach and lyricist Hal David were introduced at the famous Brill Building in New York City, and began their writing partnership. Almost a year later, they received a significant career break when their song "The Story of My Life" was recorded by Marty Robbins for Columbia Records, becoming a #1 hit on the U.S. Country charts in late 1957. Soon afterwards, "Magic Moments" was recorded by Perry Como for RCA Records, and became a #4 U.S. hit in February of that year. These two songs hit #1 in the UK back-to-back ("The Story of My Life" in a version by Michael Holliday), giving Burt and lyricist Hal David the honor of being the first songwriters in UK history to have written consecutive #1 hits. Other hits quickly followed. "Heavenly" was recorded by Johnny Mathis and became a gold record in the UK. Later the same year another Bacharach song, "Faithfully", also achieved gold record status with Mathis in the UK.
In the early 1960s, Bacharach wrote well over a hundred songs with David, including a wealth of popular hits throughout the 1960s and 1970s, many of which still enjoy popularity today. Bacharach and David were associated throughout the sixties with Dionne Warwick, a conservatory-trained vocalist whom the duo met in 1961. She began working for the duo when they needed a good singer to "demo" their songs properly for other artists. Bacharach and David noticed that Warwick's demos often surpassed the quality of the performances others were recording[citation needed]. They started writing a portion of their work specifically with Warwick in mind, which led to one of the most successful teams in popular music history.[5] Over a twenty year period, beginning in the early 1960s, Warwick managed to chart 38 singles co-written or produced by Bacharach, including twenty-two Top-40 hits on the American Billboard Hot 100 charts. During the early '60s, Bacharach also collaborated with Bob Hilliard on a number of songs such as "Mexican Divorce" for The Drifters and "Any Day Now" for Chuck Jackson.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bacharach's songs were made famous by a number of popular singers in addition to Warwick, including Dusty Springfield ("The Look of Love" from Casino Royale), ("Wishin' and Hopin"), Cilla Black (a cover of Dionne Warwick's "Anyone Who Had A Heart"), ("Alfie"), The Shirelles, The Beatles ("Baby, It's You"), The Carpenters ("(They Long to Be) Close to You"), Aretha Franklin, Isaac Hayes ("Walk On By" on the Hot Buttered Soul album), B.J. Thomas ("Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head"), Tom Jones ("What's New, Pussycat"), The Stranglers, The Drifters, Jack Jones ("Wives and Lovers"), Jackie DeShannon ("What the World Needs Now is Love"), Gene Pitney, Herb Alpert, Jerry Butler and Luther Vandross in the 1980s and 1990s.
In addition to mainstream pop, many Bacharach songs were adapted by jazz artists of the time, such as Stan Getz and Wes Montgomery. The Bacharach/David composition, "My Little Red Book", originally recorded by Manfred Mann for the film What's New, Pussycat?, and promptly covered by Love in 1966, has become a rock music standard; however, according to Robin Platts' book "Burt Bacharach and Hal David", the composer did not like this version.[6] Bacharach composed and arranged the soundtrack of the 1967 film Casino Royale which was "The Look of Love", performed by Dusty Springfield. Bacharach and David also collaborated with Broadway producer David Merrick on the 1968 musical production of Promises, Promises, which yielded several major hit songs (including the title tune). The year 1969 featured, perhaps, the most successful Bacharach-David collaboration ever, with the song "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head", which was written for and prominently featured in the acclaimed film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

[edit] Style
Bacharach's music is characterized by unusual chord progressions, striking syncopated rhythmic patterns, irregular phrasing, frequent modulation, and odd and changing meters. It tends toward a greater climactic effect than most popular music, especially greater than most popular music of the period with which he is most associated. Bacharach is more than just a songwriter, having himself arranged, conducted, and co-produced much of his recorded output. An example of his use of distinctive use of changing meter is found in "Promises, Promises" (from his score for the musical of the same name). His style is sometimes also associated with particular instrumental combinations he is assumed to favor or to have favored, including the prominent use of the flugelhorn in such works as "Walk on By", "Nikki", and "Toledo".

[edit] 1970s and 1980s
In 1973, Bacharach and David were commissioned to score the Ross Hunter-produced revival of the classic 1937 film, Lost Horizon for Columbia Pictures. The result was a critical and commercial disaster, and resulted in a flurry of lawsuits between the composer and the lyricist, as well as from Warwick, who reportedly felt abandoned when Bacharach and David refused to work together. Bacharach tried several solo projects (including the 1977 album Futures), but the projects failed to yield any memorable hits.
By the early 1980s, Bacharach's marriage to Angie Dickinson had ended, but a new partnership with lyricist Carole Bayer Sager proved rewarding, both commercially and personally. The two married, and collaborated on several major hits during the decade, including "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)" (Christopher Cross), "Heartlight" (Neil Diamond), "Making Love" (Roberta Flack), "On My Own" (Michael McDonald with Patti Labelle), and perhaps most memorably, "That's What Friends Are For" in 1985, actually the second single which reunited Bacharach and singer Warwick. The profits for the latter song were given to AIDS research. Bacharach's 1980s tunes showed a new sound, proving that Bacharach's work could continue to change with the times.
Other artists continued to revive Bacharach's earlier hits, giving them an entirely new audience in the 1980s and 1990s. Examples included Naked Eyes' 1983 dance version of "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me", Ronnie Milsap's smash 1982 country version of "Any Day Now", and many others. Bacharach also continued a successful concert career, appearing at auditoriums throughout the world, often featuring large orchestras as accompaniment. He also occasionally joined with Warwick, appearing in sold-out concerts in New York, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.

[edit] 1990s and 2000s
In 1996, celebrated jazz pianist McCoy Tyner recorded an album of nine Bacharach standards that featured Tyner's trio with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by John Clayton. In 1998, Bacharach co-wrote and recorded a Grammy-winning album with Elvis Costello, Painted from Memory, on which the compositions began to take on the sound of his earlier work. In 2006, he recorded a jazz album with Trijntje Oosterhuis and the Metropole Orchestra called The Look of Love (Burt Bacharach Songbook) which was released in November that year.[7] Bacharach collaborated with Cathy Dennis in 2002 to write an original song for the Pop Idol winner Will Young. This was "What's In Goodbye", and it appears on Young's debut album From Now On. During July 2002, Young was a guest vocalist at two of Bacharach's concerts, one at the Hammersmith Apollo and the other at Liverpool Pops.
Another star treatment of his compositions was the 2003 album Here I Am featuring Ronald Isley, revisiting a number of his 1960s compositions, and also the Vandross arrangement of A House Is Not a Home.
Bacharach's 2005 solo album At This Time saw a departure from past works in that Bacharach penned his own lyrics, some of which dealt with political themes. Guest stars on some tracks included Elvis Costello and Rufus Wainwright.
He has also worked with hip-hop producer Dr. Dre on his recent album At This Time and is expected to do work on Dr. Dre's long awaited Detox album.
On 24 October 2008, Bacharach opened the BBC Electric Proms at the Roundhouse in London, performing with the BBC Concert Orchestra accompanied by guest vocalists Adele, Beth Rowley and Jamie Cullum. The concert was a retrospective look back at his unparalleled six-decade career, including classics such as "Walk On By", The Look of Love, "I Say a Little Prayer", "What The World Needs Now", "Anyone Who Had A Heart", "24 Hours from Tulsa" and "Make It Easy On Yourself", featuring Jamie Cullum.
In early 2009 Bacharach worked with italian soul singer Karima Ammar and produced her critically acclaimed debut single Come In Ogni Ora. The song has been heard during the 59th San Remo Music Festival and also features him playing piano.

[edit] Film and television
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bacharach was featured in a dozen TV musical/variety specials videotaped in the UK for ITC, several of which were nominated for Emmy awards for direction (by Dwight Hemion). The guests included artists such as Joel Grey, Dusty Springfield, and Barbra Streisand. Bacharach and David also did the score for a short-lived ABC-TV series, ABC Stage 67, for a show titled On the Flip Side, starring Rick Nelson as a faded pop star trying for a comeback. While the series' ratings were dismal, the soundtrack showcased Bacharach's abilities to try different kinds of musical styles, ranging from (almost) 1960s rock, to pop, ballads, and Latin-tinged dance numbers.
In 1969, his instrumental composition "Nikki" (named for his daughter) premiered as the theme for the ABC Movie of the Week, a TV series which eventually ran on various nights of the week until 1975. Also during the 1970s, Bacharach and then-wife Angie Dickinson appeared in several TV commercials for Martini & Rossi beverages, and even penned a short jingle ("Say Yes") for the spots. Bacharach also occasionally appeared on TV/variety shows, such as The Merv Griffin Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and many others.
In the 1990s and 2000s, Bacharach has had cameo roles in a number of Hollywood movies including all three Austin Powers spy spoof movies. His music is also credited as providing inspiration for these movies, partially stemming from Bacharach's score for the 1967 James Bond film Casino Royale. During subsequent Burt Bacharach concert tours, each show would open with a very brief video clip from the movie Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, with Mike Myers (as Austin Powers) uttering "Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Burt Bacharach."
Bacharach appeared as a celebrity performer and guest vocal coach for contestants on the television show, "American Idol" during the 2006 season, during which an entire episode was dedicated to his music. In late 2006, Burt Bacharach appeared as the celebrity in a Geico auto insurance commercial, where he sings and plays the piano. He translates the customer's story through song ("I was hit. ..in the rear!")
In 2008, Bacharach featured in the BBC Electric Proms at The Roundhouse with the BBC Concert Orchestra[8]. He performed similar shows in the same year at the Walt Disney Concert Hall[9] and with the Sydney Symphony.

[edit] Legacy and influence

Popular songwriter Jimmy Webb has acknowledged Bacharach's influence on his work. So did singer-songwriter Laura Nyro.
On Status Quo's album Heavy Traffic, Track number 8 is named "Diggin' Burt Bacharach."
In interviews, Donald Fagen from Steely Dan has frequently cited Bacharach's combination of "Ravel-like harmony and street corner soul" as an early influence. Bacharach has praised Steely Dan's Aja highly.
On the cover of Oasis' first album Definitely Maybe, there is a framed picture of Bacharach to the left resting up against the sofa. Later, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher performed a duet of "This Guy's In Love With You" live with Bacharach. Gallagher also admits to having stolen elements of that same song when composing the Oasis track "Half the World Away".
Alternative-avant garde guitarist/composer Leonid Soybelman released an album named Much Ado About Burt Bacharach's Walk On By.
The British duo Swing Out Sister cites Bacharach as a major influence as well.
The British band Saint Etienne were influenced heavily by Bacharach's piano motifs.
German actor-musician André Schneider performed two of Bacharach's songs on his 1997 chanson album Sleepless Cities.
British keyboardist and composer Tony Banks from Genesis.
The American band Faith No More performed the song "This Guy's In Love With You" in several concerts.
Beach Boys lead man Brian Wilson has cited Bacharach as a heavy influence on his songwriting.
Welsh rock/electronic/psychedelic band Super Furry Animals have also been influenced by Bacharach's distinctive sound.
The Last Shadow Puppets have covered 'My Little Red Book'


[edit] Family
Bacharach has been married four times, first to Paula Stewart (1953–1958), second to actress Angie Dickinson (1965–1980), third to lyricist Carole Bayer Sager (1982–1991) — with whom he collaborated on a number of pieces — and fourth (since 1993) to Jane Strauss Hanson. He had a daughter, Nikki, with Dickinson; has an adopted son, Cristopher, with Bayer Sager; and has a son and a daughter, Oliver and Raleigh, with Jane.
Nikki Bacharach was born prematurely in 1966, and it was for her he wrote the instrumental piece "Nikki". She had chronic health problems as a result of her premature birth such as poor eyesight, and was also diagnosed with severe Asperger Syndrome and spent nine years at the Wilson Center, a psychiatric residential treatment facility for adolescents located in Faribault, Minnesota.[10] She committed suicide by suffocation using a plastic bag and helium on January 4, 2007 at age 40.[11] Bacharach said "She quietly and peacefully committed suicide to escape the ravages to her brain brought on by Asperger's".[12]
