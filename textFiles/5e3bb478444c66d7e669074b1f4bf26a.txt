Folktronica or Electrofolk is a genre of music comprising various elements of folk music and electronica.

[edit] History of term
The label "folktronica" seems to have originated in the British press, having come to encompass performers and bands that include elements of ambient electronica, folk, jazz, classical, and even hip-hop. In 2001, postmodern pop artist Momus released an album titled Folktronic deliberately exploring (and satirizing) the fusion [1]. A similar genre is "Laptop folk", which refers to a slightly more minimalistic electronic folk [2].
Folktronica was a term first used to describe the sound of the second album of British producer Kieran Hebden (Four Tet), Pause.
