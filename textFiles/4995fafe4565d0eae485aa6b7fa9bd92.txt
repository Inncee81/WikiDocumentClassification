Linked Data is a sub-topic of the Semantic Web. The term Linked Data is used to describe a method of exposing, sharing, and connecting data via dereferenceable URIs on the Web.

[edit] Principles
Tim Berners-Lee outlined four principles of Linked Data in his Design Issues: Linked Data note, paraphrased along the following lines:

Use URIs to identify things that you expose to the Web as resources.
Use HTTP URIs so that people can locate and look up (dereference) these things.
Provide useful information about the resource when its URI is dereferenced.
Include links to other, related URIs in the exposed data as a means of improving information discovery on the Web.

Tim Berners-Lee gave a presentation on Linked Data at the TED 2009 conference.

[edit] Components

URIs (specifically, of the dereferenceable variety)
HTTP
Resource Description Framework (RDF)
Serialization formats (RDFa, RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and others)


[edit] Linking Open Data Community Project




Class linkages within the Linking Open Data datasets


The goal of the W3C Semantic Web Education and Outreach group's Linking Open Data community project is to extend the Web with a data commons by publishing various open datasets as RDF on the Web and by setting RDF links between data items from different data sources. As of October 2007, datasets consist of over two billion RDF triples, which are interlinked by over two million RDF links.

[edit] Dataset Instance and Class Relationships
Clickable diagrams that show the individual datasets and their relationships within LOD, as shown by the figures to the right, are:

Instance relationships amongst datasets
Class relationships amongst datasets


[edit] Examples

[edit] Datasets

DBpedia - a dataset containing extracted data from Wikipedia; it contains about 2.18 million concepts described by 218 million triples, including abstracts in 11 different languages
DBLP Bibliography - provides bibliographic information about scientific papers; it contains about 800,000 articles, 400,000 authors, and approx. 15 million triples
GeoNames provides RDF descriptions of more than 6,500,000 geographical features worldwide.
Revyu - a Review service consumes and publishes Linked Data, primarily from DBpedia.
riese - serving statistical data about 500 million Europeans (the first linked dataset deployed with XHTML+RDFa)
UMBEL - a lightweight reference structure of 20,000 subject concept classes and their relationships derived from OpenCyc, which can act as binding classes to external data; also has links to 1.5 million named entities from DBpedia and YAGO
Sensorpedia - A scientific initiative at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using a RESTful web architecture to link to sensor data and related sensing systems.


[edit] Use Case Demos

Data from Northwind SQL Schema as Linked Data
Linked data for the discipline of numismatics
