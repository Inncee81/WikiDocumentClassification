PhotoRec is a data recovery software tool designed to recover lost files from digital camera memory, (CompactFlash, Memory Stick, SecureDigital, SmartMedia, Microdrive, MMC, USB Memory Drives etc.), Hard Disks and CD-ROMs. It recovers most common photo formats, including JPEG, and also recovers audio files including MP3, document formats such as Microsoft Office, PDF, and HTML, and archive formats including ZIP.
PhotoRec does not attempt to write to the damaged media you are about to recover from. Recovered files are instead written to the directory from where you are running PhotoRec or any other directory you choose. PhotoRec is shipped with TestDisk.

[edit] Operating systems
PhotoRec is compatible with:

DOS (either real or in a Windows 9x DOS box)
Microsoft Windows (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista)
Linux
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
SunOS
Mac OS X
