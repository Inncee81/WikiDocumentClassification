Logo Prix Ars Electronica


The Prix Ars Electronica is one of the most important yearly prizes in the field of electronic and interactive art, computer animation, digital culture and music. It has been awarded since 1987 by Ars Electronica (Linz, Austria), one of the world's major centers for art and technology.
In 2005, the Golden Nica, the highest prize, was awarded in six categories: "Computer Animation/Visual Effects," "Digital Musics," "Interactive Art," "Net Vision," "Digital Communities" and the "u19" award for "freestyle computing." Each Golden Nica came with a prize of €10,000, apart from the u19 category, where the prize was €5,000. In each category, there are also Awards of Distinction and Honorary Mentions.




The Golden Nica Award


The Golden Nica is gold plated replica of the Greek Nike of Samothrace. "Prix Ars Electronica" is a phrase comprised of French, Latin and Spanish words, loosely translated as "Electronic Arts Prize." The symbol for the Ars Electronica Center (available here) was chosen from a 1995 design competition for the opening of the first Center. It expresses connectivity and is reminiscent of ancient icons... but also looks like a circuit board.
