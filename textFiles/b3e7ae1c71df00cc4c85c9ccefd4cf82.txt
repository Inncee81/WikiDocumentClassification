Mr. Tickle, 1971






Little Miss Chatterbox, 1984


Mr. Men is a series of 48 (only 46 published in English) children's books by Roger Hargreaves started in 1971. Little Miss was an accompanying series of 42 (only 33 published in English) books by the same author with female characters that started in 1981. After Hargreaves' death in 1988, his son, Adam Hargreaves, began writing and illustrating new stories involving the Mr. Men and Little Miss characters, including the creation of ten new characters, four of which were inspired by work Roger Hargreaves had produced before his death.

[edit] History
Mr. Tickle was the first Mr. Men character created by Hargreaves after his son, Adam, asked him what a tickle looked like: a round, orange figure with long, bendy arms. Each book in the original Mr. Men and Little Miss series introduced a different title character and their single dominant trait in order to convey a double simple moral lesson. The Mr. Men and Little Miss characters would frequently reappear in the later books of other characters. The books' simple and silly stories, with bright-coloured, boldly drawn illustrations, made them quite popular, with sales over 100 million worldwide in 22 languages.
In 2001, a competition was held in the Sunday Times for children to submit their own Mr. Men character, which was to be published in a limited edition to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the series. Mr. Cheeky by 8 year-old Gemma Almond was the winner, and her creation was then published and sold only in branches of W H Smith, with a portion of the proceeds going to a charity for children's leukemia.
In April 2004, Hargreaves' widow, Christine, sold the rights to the Mr. Men and Little Miss characters to the UK entertainment group, Chorion.
In 2006, to celebrate 35 years of Mr. Men (and 25 years of Little Miss) Mr. Birthday and Little Miss Birthday were published. There was also an art exhibition at The Art Animation Gallery[1] in Central London, and in October 2006, Adam Hargreaves created the first Little Miss character based on a real person; 'Little Miss Stella', based on Stella McCartney, appeared in a limited edition of 1,000 books produced as fashion show invitations.[2]
The typeface for the Little Miss books from Bossy to Star is Univers; the books from Busy to Sommersault use Helvetica; and all the other books in the series use Optima.

[edit] TV series
The Mr. Men characters have been adapted into four animated television series. The first was produced in 1975 by Terry Ward's company, Flicks Films, formerly known as 101 Film Productions, with the voices and the narration provided by Arthur Lowe (better known for his role as Captain Mainwaring in the sitcom Dad's Army). During 1983, a second series by Flicks Films featured the Little Miss characters, and was narrated by John and Pauline Alderton (credited as Pauline Collins). The third series, Mr. Men and Little Miss, was produced in 1995 and aired on TV from 1995 to 1997 and was narrated by Geoffrey Palmer.
In 2006 Renegade Animation produced The Mr. Men Show, a new animated series which debuted on Channel Five's Milkshake! (UK) in February 2008. There would only be 25 characters featured in the first season, and most have had their names or appearances altered. The Mr. Men Show is directed by Mark Risley and written and produced by Eryk Casemiro and Kate Boutilier, the creative team from Nickelodeon's Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys and As Told by Ginger. The opening and closing narration is voiced by actor Simon Callow in the UK version and Joseph J. Terry in the US version.

Mr. Tickle's story begins with him in bed and making himself breakfast without getting up because of his "extraordinarily long arms". He then decides that it is a tickling sort of day and so goes around town tickling people - a teacher, a policeman, a greengrocer, a station guard, a doctor, a butcher and a postman.

10
Mr. Silly

11
Mr. Uppity
1972



Mr Uppity is probably the snootiest, richest, rudest man in the whole world. And so it follows that he is not very popular.
Thankfully our little friends the goblins take an interest in Mr Uppity, and use their magic powers to frighten him into behaving like a decent person.






12
Mr. Small
1972



He’s as cute as ickle pickle, and probably just as tasty.
Mr. Small is, unsurprisingly, the smallest of the Mr. Men. He lives in a house underneath a daisy, at the bottom of Mr. Robinson’s garden. His tiny size is an occupational hazard, as he soon finds out when he falls into sweet jars, mustard pots and match boxes. But he finds eternal happiness and fame when a man decides to write a book all about his adventures.

16
Mr. Noisy
1976



Mr. Noisy slammed doors and clumped down the hill; and even when he was asleep, his snore could be mistaken for a herd of elephants. He changed his ways when the residents pretended they couldn’t hear him. Eventually Mr. Noisy got so fed up of not being heard, he succumbed to their plan and began to whisper.





17
Mr. Lazy
1976



Mr Lazy lies in bed most of day. He only wakes up to yawn! But when he does get out of bed, he falls asleep in the garden!
However boring his life sounds, it soon becomes exciting when Mr Busy and Mr Bustle come to visit him. They've got all sorts of things for Mr Lazy to do, but he is never too keen to be getting on with them, not when there's sleeping to be getting on with!






18
Mr. Funny
1976



Mr. Funny is similar to Mr Happy. He drives about in his little shoe car making people laugh.
He performed his unique act of amusing magic at the zoo, which was closed due to all the animals having colds. Good old Mr. Funny pulled funny faces at the elephant, the lion, the bear, and the giraffe, and left them in fits of giggles.

Looking rather like Mr. Happy with a hat, Mr. Bounce is the Mr. Man who can’t sit still. Luckily, the superbly named Dr. Makeyouwell gives him a pair of tiny red boots. But being Mr. Man land, they aren’t ordinary boots. These boots are extremely heavy, and keep Mr. Bounce’s feet firmly on the ground. But the best thing about Mr. Bounce is the noise he makes when he hits the ground.





23
Mr. Muddle
1976



Poor muddled Mr. Muddle. He can’t do anything right. In fact he is so muddled up, his face is on the wrong side of his body!
He’s only too happy to lend a hand, but instead, usually ends up making the situation worse. Ask him to push and he’ll pull. Ask him to pick something up, and he’ll put it down.
But the clever people of Seatown realised that the way to get him to do the right thing, is to ask him to do the opposite.






24
Mr. Dizzy
1976



Poor Mr. Dizzy is the laughing stock of Cleverland.
He’s not very bright and all his neighbours delight in making him look stupid. When Mr. Dizzy drinks the water from the wishing well, he magically becomes intelligent and is able to outwit the pig and the elephant who had both made him look silly earlier.
It just goes to prove that if clever people can be confused by nice but dim Mr. Dizzy, then they should do it.






25
Mr. Impossible
1976



Mr Impossible is able to read backwards, upside down, hanging from the light shade whilst juggling with eggs.





26
Mr. Strong
1976



Mr Strong is so strong that you can barely believe it. He is the nearest thing to a super hero in Mr Man land. He gets all his strength from eating hundred of eggs!
His strength sometimes gets him in trouble, and he regularly breaks everything he touches by accident. But sometimes it helps save the day, especially if there is something really heavy that needs carrying.






27
Mr. Grumpy
1978



Mr. Grumpy is grumpy and he stamps on Mr Happy's foot, but he never apologised to Mr. Happy...

31

1978



Mr. Tall is one of the luckiest Mr. Men.
It takes him just four minutes to walk 40 miles; he can step over trees; and he can dangle his feet in the sea whilst sitting on the edge of a cliff. But Mr. Tall is gloomy about his long legs.
Luckily, Mr. Tickle, Mr. Nosey and Mr. Greedy are on hand to tell him that over proportioned body parts can be a benefit.






32
Mr. Worry
1978



Mr Worry practically worries on anything and everything.





33
Mr. Nonsense
1978



Mr. Nonsense sleeps in a rowing boat, in his house, which is up a tree.

When it snows (yellow snow, of course), the two of them go tobogganing in their makeshift toboggan - Mr. Nonsense’s bed boat!
And somehow he manages to make square snow balls!

Mr. Wrong

Mr. Skinny lives in Fatland; a place 100 miles from Mr. Greedy's house. Their lifestyles are just as wide apart.

36
Mr. Mischief
1978



“Oh mischief, glorious mischief … I do so love it!” he cries, as he claims another victim.
Mr. Happy, Mr. Greedy, and Mr. Funny all fall prey to Mr. Mischief and his tricks. Until, that is, he meets a wizard. As Mr. Mischief tries to swap his magic wand for a piece of wood, the wizard grabs him by the nose, and warns him he won’t get away with his tricks again. As the mischievous man goes home, all the pranks he played on the others are repeated on him, and he learns his lesson.
But not for long … as Mr. Fussy finds out to his cost.






37
Mr. Clever
1978



Mr. Clever is the self-acclaimed Cleverest Person In The World!
Not only that, but he has some fantastic gadgets, such as his alarm clock that makes tea; and his toothbrush that squeezes out the toothpaste for him. How clever!

It takes Mr. Busy just seconds to do something that would take us half an hour. He is always on the go, and expects others to keep up with him. Which, of course, they can't.

"Bah!" says Mr. Grumble.
He hates laughing; he hates singing; he hates people who pretend to be clowns. And he hates being turned into a pig -- which is exactly what happens whenever he grumbles.
