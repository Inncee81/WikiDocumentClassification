The Incredible Machine (aka TIM) is a series of computer games that were originally designed and coded by Kevin Ryan and produced by Jeff Tunnell, the now-defunct Jeff Tunnell Productions, and published by Dynamix; the 1993 through 1995 versions had the same development team, but the later 2000–2001 titles had different designers. All versions were published by Sierra Entertainment.

[edit] Objective
The general objective of the games is to create a series of Heath Robinson, or Rube Goldberg devices: arrange a given collection of objects in a needlessly complex fashion so as to perform some simple task (for example, "put the ball into a box" or "light a candle"). Available objects ranged from simple ropes and pulleys to electrical generators, bowling balls, and even cats and mice. The levels usually have some fixed objects that cannot be moved by the player, and so the only way to solve the puzzle is carefully arrange the given objects around the fixed items. There is also a "freeform" option that allows the user to "play" with all the objects with no set goal or to also build their own puzzles with goals for other players to attempt to solve.
Notably, the games simulated not only the physical interactions between objects, but also ambient effects like varying air pressure and gravity. The engine does not use a random number generator in its simulation of physics, assuring that the results for any given "machine" are reproducible.

[edit] Versions
The series featured the following versions:

The Incredible Machine (1992, MS-DOS / Macintosh / 3DO)
The Even More Incredible Machine (1993, MS-DOS / Microsoft Windows, Macintosh)
Sid & Al's Incredible Toons (1993, MS-DOS)
The Incredible Toon Machine (1994, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh)
The Incredible Machine 2 (1994, MS-DOS / Macintosh)
The Incredible Machine 3 (1995, Microsoft Windows / Macintosh)
Return of the Incredible Machine: Contraptions (2000, Microsoft Windows / Macintosh)
The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions (2001, Microsoft Windows / Macintosh)

The developers of the series have been criticized by fans for recycling content, specifically all the games after The Incredible Machine 2, rather than creating new additions to the games.

[edit] The Incredible Machine
The Incredible Machine, the first game in the series, was originally going to be developed for Electronic Arts for the Commodore 64 in 1984, but Dynamix worked on Arcticfox for the Amiga instead and work did not start on The Incredible Machine until the spring of 1993. The Even More Incredible Machine was actually an extended version of the original The Incredible Machine and had around 160 levels, about twice the number of levels in the original game, and also had quite a few more parts.

[edit] The Incredible Machine 2
The Incredible Machine 2 introduced new levels, an extended assortment of parts, a new interface, significantly improved graphics, sounds, and music, and two player hotseat play. It also improved on the "freeform" mode, allowing players to create completely playable puzzles by defining not only the participating parts, but also the set of circumstances under which the puzzle will be considered "solved". In terms of gameplay, this version provided the biggest addition to the series, while subsequent updates were basically only ports of the game to newer operating systems with updated graphics/sounds and sometimes new puzzles, but no new parts.

[edit] The Incredible Machine 3
The Incredible Machine 3, on some releases entitled Professor Tim's Incredible Machines, contained the same levels as The Incredible Machine 2, but had a new interface, as well as compatibility with Windows 3.1. It also allowed the player to build backgrounds for the puzzles and to scale the playing field.

[edit] Return of The Incredible Machine: Contraptions
In the next two versions, Return of The Incredible Machine: Contraptions and The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions, the game interface was updated again with new graphics, music, and sounds. They featured mostly new levels, except that Return of The Incredible Machine: Contraptions contained many levels (including most of the tutorial levels) from The Incredible Machine 3. The custom backgrounds and variable sized playing fields were also removed.

[edit] The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions
Even More Contraptions started a service allowing players to share their homemade puzzles using a service called "WonSwap", but due to the age of the game, this service is now defunct.[1]

[edit] Incredible Toons
Sid & Al's Incredible Toons and The Incredible Toon Machine are not an official part of the series, but are essentially a cartoon version of the same concept, created by Chris Cole.

[edit] Awards
The Incredible Machine was the winner of several prizes due to its innovative style and simulation abilities. It was innovative enough, in fact, that Sid & Al's Incredible Toons earned Jeff Tunnell and Chris Cole a patent for the game concepts.[2]

[edit] Availability
Some games from The Incredible Machine series are now very difficult to find, except from peer to peer networks, used software stores and online auction sites like eBay. The original publisher, Dynamix, was closed in 2001 by parent company Sierra, who was in turn scrapped in 2004 by its parent, Vivendi Universal. The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions, however, can be found via GameTap and Hoyle Puzzle Games 2005.
A mobile phone version was developed by Mobile Interactions Group[3] and published by Vivendi Games Mobile in 2006.[4]
The original game has been announced for a download release for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, but so far no price has been given and the only release date was 2009.[5]
