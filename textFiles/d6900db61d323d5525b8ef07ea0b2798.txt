From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The structures or musical forms of songs in popular music are typically sectional forms, such as strophic form. Other common forms include thirty-two-bar form, verse-chorus form, and twelve bar blues. Popular music songs are rarely through-composed.
The verse and chorus are considered primary, while the introduction and coda or ending may or may not be used in different performances and are not considered essential to the identity of most songs. A bridge is slightly more important. The verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song though the bridge, intro, and outro are usually only used once.

[edit] Elements

[edit] Intro
Main article: Introduction (music)
The introduction is a unique section that comes at the beginning of the piece. It usually builds up suspense for the listener so when the downbeat drops in, it is more of an emotional surprise. In classical music this would be referred to as the overture.

[edit] Pre-Chorus
Also referred to as a "build" or "transitional bridge," the pre-chorus functions to connect the verse to the chorus with intermediary material, typically using pre-dominant or similar transitional harmonies. Often when the verse and chorus involve the same harmonic structure, for example, the pre-chorus will introduce a new harmonic pattern in order to make the reappearance of the verse harmonies in the chorus seem fresh.

[edit] Chorus
Main article: Refrain
Chorus is used to mean the refrain of a song, which often sharply contrasts the verse melodically, rhythmically, and harmonically, and assumes a higher level of dynamics and activity, often with added instrumentation. Chorus form, or strophic form, is a sectional and/or additive way of structuring a piece of music based on the repetition of one formal section or block.
When two or more sections of the song have basically identical music and lyrics these sections are probably instances of the chorus. Sometimes this can be repeated at the end and at the beginning.

[edit] Bridge
Main article: Bridge (music)
In song writing, a bridge is an interlude that connects two parts of that song, building a harmonic connection between those parts.
Normally you should have heard the verse at least twice. The bridge may then replace the 3rd verse or precede it. In the latter case, it delays an expected chorus. The chorus after the bridge is usually last and is often repeated in order to stress that it is final.
If and when you expect a verse or a chorus and you get something that is musically and lyrically different from both verse and chorus, it is most likely the bridge.

[edit] Collision
A collision is a section of music where two different parts overlap one another. It is mostly used in fast-paced music.

[edit] Vocal runs
A vocal run is a melismatic variation on the chorus of a song. It's mostly used at the end or beginning of a song and adds a new layer to a chorus.

[edit] Instrumental Solo
Main article: Solo (music)
A solo is a section of reduced instrumentality designed to feature a single performer.

[edit] Outro
Main article: Outro
An outro, also called extro, is a unique ending to the song, and is equivalent to a coda or tag.

[edit] Break
Main article: Break (music)
A break is an instrumental or percussion section that forms an interlude during a song.

[edit] Ad Lib
Latin: Ad Libitum, "at will". Any additional line inserted between parts of a song. Usually, the ad lib repeats the previously-sung line in a different tune or key, and is sometimes even spoken. The singer may at his/her discretion include ad libs not originally in the song.

[edit] AABA form
Main article: Thirty-two-bar form
Thirty-two-bar form uses four sections, most often eight measures long each (4×8=32), two verses or A sections, a contrasting B section, the bridge or "middle-eight", and a return of the verse in one last A section (AABA).

[edit] Variation on the basic structure
Verse-chorus form or ABA form may be combined with AABA form, in compound AABA forms. a1 and a2 can also be used.

[edit] Twelve bar blues and other chord progressions
Main article: chord progression
Sections are often defined through the use of different chord progressions in different sections. However, the repetition of one chord progression may mark off the only section in a simple verse form such as the twelve bar blues.
