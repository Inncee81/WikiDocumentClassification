The term team building generally refers to the selection, development, and collective motivation of result-oriented teams. Team building is pursued via a variety of practices, such as group self-assessment and group-dynamic games, and generally sits within the theory and practice of organizational development.
When a team in an organizational development context embarks upon a process of self-assessment in order to gauge its own effectiveness and thereby improve performance, it can be argued that it is engaging in team building, although this may be considered a narrow definition.
The process of team building includes,

clarifying the goal, and building ownership across the team and
identifying the inhibitors to teamwork and removing or overcoming them, or if they cannot be removed, mitigating their negative effect on the team.

There are 10 Steps of Team Building 1. Getting Upper-Management Support 2. Define the purpose of your team 3. Identify Time Frames 4. Select Team members 5. Team-Member openings 6. Share the overall purpose 7. Team Name 8. Create the team mission statement and goals 9. Core Team Issues 10. Establishing team norms[1]
To assess itself, a team seeks feedback to find out both:

its current strengths as a team
its current weakness

To improve its current performance, a team uses the feedback from the team assessment in order to:

identify any gap between the desired state and the actual state
design a gap-closure strategy
