SuperMemo (from "Super Memory") is a learning method and software package developed by SuperMemo World in Poland from 1985 to the present. It is a practical application of the proposed spaced repetition learning technique that has been proposed for efficient instruction by a number of psychologists as early as in the 1930s. The authors of the learning method, and lead programmers of the software, are Dr Edward Jacek Gorzelańczyk and Dr Piotr Wozniak.
Proponents of the method claim that it makes possible faster learning and indefinite retention of memories (with repetition).
The method is available as a computer program for Windows, Windows CE, Palm Pilot, etc. It can also be used in a web browser or even without a computer. SuperMemo is based on research into long-term memory.
The desktop version of SuperMemo (since v. 2002) supports incremental reading.

[edit] Software implementation
The software implementation of the SuperMemo algorithm in its most rudimentary and basic form is simply this: A database of Question & Answer (Q&A) fields (or more practically, digital and electronic flashcards). The database is either a pre-made collection, self-made, or in some cases both through Merging.
The software then traverses with the user through each element that is scheduled for repetition (a new set of "reps" is computed for each day on the calendar). The program gathers information about the user's memory through their responses and grades to their active recalls (conscious response to their questions -- giving a conscious answer as opposed to passive review).
In three simple steps, the user reviews the card as follows:

The user is given a question by SuperMemo
The user responds with an answer from his own mind (active recall)
The user gives himself a grade of what best reflects his recall. (A-E grade, or 5-0 grade -- depending on what version and/or platform).

SuperMemo then calculates the necessary intervals for proposed repetitions of a single item or flash-cards. The specific algorithm SuperMemo uses has been published, and re-implemented in other, non-commercial programs such as Anki and Mnemosyne among others.
