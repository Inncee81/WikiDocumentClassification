This article is about the term's general meaning.  For its use as a proper noun, see Culture Shock.
Culture shock refers to the anxiety and feelings (of surprise, disorientation, uncertainty, confusion, etc.) felt when people have to operate within a different and unknown cultural or social environment, such as a foreign country. It grows out of the difficulties in assimilating the new culture, causing difficulty in knowing what is appropriate and what is not. This is often combined with a dislike for or even disgust (moral or aesthetical) with certain aspects of the new or different culture. The term was introduced for the first time in 1954 by Kalervo Oberg.[citation needed]

[edit] Phases of culture shock




Enthusiastic welcome offered to the first Indian student to arrive to Dresden, Germany (1951)


The shock (of moving to a foreign country) often consists of distinct phases, though not everyone passes through these phases and not everyone is in the new culture long enough to pass through all three[1]:

Honeymoon Phase - During this period the differences between the old and new culture are seen in a romantic light, wonderful and new. For example, in moving to a new country, an individual might love the new foods, the pace of the life, the people's habits, the buildings and so on.
Negotiation Phase - After some time (usually weeks), differences between the old and new culture become apparent and may create anxiety. One may long for food the way it is prepared in one's native country, may find the pace of life too fast or slow, may find the people's habits annoying, disgusting, and irritating etc. This phase is often marked by mood swings caused by minor issues or without apparent reason. Depression is not uncommon.
Adjustment Phase - Again, after some time (usually 6 - 12 months), one grows accustomed to the new culture and develops routines. One knows what to expect in most situations and the host country no longer feels all that new. One becomes concerned with basic living again, and things become more "normal".
Reverse Culture Shock (a.k.a. Re-entry Shock) - Returning to one's home culture after growing accustomed to a new one can produce the same effects as described above, which an affected person often finds more surprising and difficult to deal with as the original culture shock.

There are three basic outcomes of the Adjustment Phase:

Some people find it impossible to accept the foreign culture and integrate. They isolate themselves from the host country's environment, which they come to perceive as hostile, withdraw into a ghetto and see return to their own culture as the only way out. These Rejectors also have the greatest problems re-integrating back home after return. Approx. 60% of expatriates behave in this way.
Some people integrate fully and take on all parts of the host culture while losing their original identity. They normally remain in the host country forever. Approx. 10% of expatriates belong to this group of Adopters.
Some people manage to adapt the aspects of the host culture they see as positive, while keeping some of their own and creating their unique blend. They have no major problems returning home or relocating elsewhere. Approx. 30% of expatriates are these so-called Cosmopolitans.


[edit] Coping with culture shock

Experience makes it easier to cope with the difficulties of relocation. Some common strategies used to make the transition easier are:[2]:

Learning about the country and its culture before departing: E.g. reading, studying the language or attending cultural classes. This way, the country and its people are more familiar upon arrival, one is more aware of differences and better prepared to deal with them.
Avoiding offense: Trying to not be offended, not offend locals, or be entangled in cultural misunderstanding.
Being open-minded about the culture one visits and tolerant / accepting of its unfamiliar aspects.
Taking a 'time out' or rest apart from cultural exchange in order to reduce the 'shock' of adjustment.

Some intercultural communication researchers claim that culture shock has many positive effects on intercultural sojourners, like increasing self-efficacy[3] and helping improve self-motivation.[4]
