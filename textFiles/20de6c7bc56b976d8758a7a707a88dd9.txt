[edit] Origins
In 2006, this day was celebrated for the first time all over Spain and on the Internet, thanks to the publicity given by some media as:

Salas, Javier (2006-05-26). "Comecocos y mangas toman la calle: la revancha de los frikis". Telecinco. http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/concentracion/orgullo_friki/comecocos/dn_25946.htm. Retrieved on 2006-05-26. 
Perez, Javier (2006-05-26). "Orgullo friki". El Mundo. http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/05/26/descodificador/1148596810.html. Retrieved on 2005-05-26. 
Ramos, David (2006-05-25). "25 de mayo: Día del Orgullo Friki". 20minutos. http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/122796/0/dia/orgullo/friki/. Retrieved on 2005-05-25. 

The biggest concentration took place in Madrid, where 300 Geeks demonstrated their pride together with a human pacman.

[edit] 2007 celebration
In 2007, the celebration counted with more help from Official institutions (as the Price Circus in Madrid) and has been more widely celebrated throughout Spain. Official acts were announced in Pilar de la Horadada, Cádiz, Huesca, Calaf, Huelva and Valencia. A Nerd Blood Donation campaign took place. Among other acts, the movie "Gritos en el pasillo" ("Screams in the corridor") was presented.

[edit] 2008 Geek Pride Day comes to America
In 2008, Geek Pride Day crossed the Atlantic, and was officially celebrated in America, where it was heralded by numerous bloggers, coalescing around the launch of the GeekPrideDay website. Math author, Euler Book Prize winner, and geek blogger John Derbyshire not only did a shout out, but announced [2] that he would be appearing in the Fifth Avenue parade, dressed as number 57, on the prime number float - prompting some bloggers to say they'd be looking for him.

[edit] 2009 Geek Pride Day comes to Ottawa, Canada
Nerd Pride Day is set to come to Canada in May 2009, with festivities planned in Ottawa, Canada, the capital city. Ottawa is home to the Canada Science and Technology Museum as well, the Ottawa Chess Club, and a notable research centre in Canada [3]

[edit] Basic rights and responsibilities of nerds
A manifesto was created to celebrate the first Nerd Pride Day which included the following list of basic rights and responsibilities of nerds.[1]
Rights:

The right to be even nerdier.
The right to not leave your house.
The right to not have a significant other and to be a virgin.
The right to not like football or any other sport.
The right to associate with other nerds.
The right to have few friends (or none at all).
The right to have all the nerdy friends that you want.
The right to not be "in-style."
The right to be overweight and have poor eyesight.
The right to show off your nerdiness.
The right to take over the world.

Responsibilities:

Be a nerd, no matter what.
Try and be nerdier than anyone else.
If there is a discussion about something nerdy, you must give your opinion.
Save any and all nerdy things you have.
Do everything you can to show off your nerdy stuff as though it were a "museum of nerdiness."
Don't be a generalized nerd. You must specialize in something.
Attend every nerdy movie on opening night and buy every nerdy book before anyone else.
Wait in line on every opening night. If you can go in costume or at least with a related t-shirt, all the better.
Don't waste your time on anything not related to nerddom.
Try to take over the world!
