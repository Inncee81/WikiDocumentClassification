Nationality

Occupation
Marketing Consultant


Philip Kotler (born 27 May 1931 in Chicago) is the S.G. Johnson & Son Distinguished Professor of International Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He received his master's degree at the University of Chicago and his PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in economics. He did postdoctoral work in mathematics at Harvard University and in behavioral science at the University of Chicago.
He was selected in 2001 as the #4 major management guru by the Financial Times (behind Jack Welch, Bill Gates, and Peter Drucker,) and has been hailed by the Management Centre Europe as "the world's foremost expert on the strategic practice of marketing." In 2008, the Wall Street Journal listed him as the 6th most influential person on business thinking.
Kotler has consulted many major U.S. and foreign companies, including IBM, Michelin, Bank of America, Merck, General Electric, Honeywell, and Motorola—in the areas of marketing strategy, planning and organization, and international marketing.
He presents seminars in major international cities around the world on the latest marketing developments to companies and other organizations.

[edit] Empirical Research by Philip Kotler
In 2002 Professor Byron Sharp posted a question to the marketing academic email list ELMAR asking if Philip Kotler had ever made any empirical discoveries. Kotler replied (edited): "Dr. Byron Sharp raises a fair question. Most of my empirical work has been in consulting engagements where I would arrange for marketing research studies to yield evidence for the company's best strategy move. Being trained as an economist, most of my early intellectual work consists in building models of how marketing works. Later I worked on developing new concepts for marketing theory and practice, such as demarketing, social marketing, megamarketing, synchromarketing, place marketing, person marketing, etc."
