Part of the AFI 100 Years... series, AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes is a list of the top 100 movie quotations in American cinema. The American Film Institute revealed the list in June of 2005 in a three-hour television program on CBS. The program was hosted by actor Pierce Brosnan and had commentary from many Hollywood actors and filmmakers.
A jury consisting of 1,500 film artists, critics, and historians selected "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn," spoken by Clark Gable in the Civil War epic Gone with the Wind as the most memorable American movie quotation of all time.
Casablanca has the most quotes of any movie on the list, with six. Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz are next, with three each. Fourteen different actors, ten men and four women, each have two or more quotations attributed to them. Leading this select ensemble is Humphrey Bogart, who has five, four of them from Casablanca. Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh are tied for the most quotations by an actress, with three. Marlon Brando, Tom Hanks, and Al Pacino also have three apiece. James Cagney, Sean Connery, Clint Eastwood, Charlton Heston, Judy Garland, Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dustin Hoffman and Gloria Swanson each have two.

[edit] About
One actor has four quotes playing the same character in the same movie: Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (#5, #20, #43 and #67). Three actresses have two quotes playing the same character in the same movie: Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind (#31 and #59), Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard (#7 and #24) and Judy Garland in "The Wizard of Oz" (#4 and #23).
Three actors have quotes playing the same character in different movies: Clint Eastwood as Harry Callahan in Sudden Impact (#6) and Dirty Harry (#51); Sean Connery as James Bond in Dr. No (#22) and Goldfinger (#90); and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator (#37 and #76) in Terminator and T2.
One of the quotations - #22, "Bond. James Bond." - was spoken by a single character, played by six different actors across 22 different movies.[1]
Four of the quotations on the list consist of one word, or a single word repeated: "Rosebud," from Citizen Kane, "Plastics," from The Graduate, "Attica! Attica!" from Dog Day Afternoon, and "Toga! Toga!" from National Lampoon's Animal House. The longest is Katharine Hepburn's quote from On Golden Pond ("Listen to me, mister. You're my knight in shining armor...") at 40 words.
Three of the quotations were taken from actual events:

Lou Gehrig's farewell speech ("The Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth") from The Pride of the Yankees (#38)
Apollo 13's distress call ("Houston, we have a problem"; the official NASA transcript is "Houston, we've had a problem") (#50)
George Cohan's signature line ("My mother thanks you,...") from Yankee Doodle Dandy (#97)

In addition, Jack Nicholson's "Here's Johnny" line from The Shining (#68) was Johnny Carson's introduction on The Tonight Show.

[edit] Criteria
Jurors were asked to consider the following criteria in making their selections:

Movie Quotation: A statement, phrase or brief exchange of dialogue spoken in an American film.[2] Lyrics from songs are not eligible.
Cultural Impact: Movie quotations that viewers use in their own lives and situations; circulating through popular culture, they become part of the national lexicon.
Legacy: Movie quotations that viewers use to evoke the memory of a treasured film, thus ensuring and enlivening its historical legacy.

[edit] Footnotes


^ a b Appears in some form in a total of 21 films; Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die, The Man With The Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View To A Kill, The Living Daylights, Licence To Kill, GoldenEye, Tommorow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day, and Casino Royale.
^ AFI defines an American film as an English language motion picture with significant creative and/or financial production elements from the United States. Additionally, only quotations from feature-length American films released before January 1, 2004, were considered. AFI defines a feature-length film as a motion picture of narrative format that is typically over 60 minutes in length.
^ Later in the film, as he is taking over the Family business, Michael repeats the line. In The Godfather Part II, young Vito says, in more accented English, "I make him an offer he don't refuse."
^ Jake LaMotta’s character repeats Brando's speech in Raging Bull.
^ Usually misquoted as "I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille."
^ Paul Newman repeats the line later in the film, mocking the prison warden, though he says "a failure", rather than simply "failure."
^ This paraphrases a line from The Tempest by William Shakespeare: "We are such stuff as dreams are made on" (often misquoted as "..made of")
^ a b Also George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.
^ Usually misquoted as "Why don't you come up and see me sometime."
^ Sometimes claimed to be an ad lib.
^ Usually misquoted as "Play it again, Sam," which is a Groucho line from the Marx Brothers movie A Night in Casablanca
^ Popularly misquoted as "Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!", most likely from Blazing Saddles in which the line was so worded.
^ An actual quote from Lou Gehrig's retirement speech.
^ Often misquoted as "If you build it, they will come."
^ The line is based on an actual message from Apollo 13. Astronaut Swigert said "Houston, we've had a problem here," then Lovell repeated "Houston, we've had a problem".
^ Often misquoted as "Do you feel lucky, punk?"
^ Often misquoted as "... How he got in my pajamas I'll never know."
^ The scene from the film in which this line appears is also excerpted in the movie's trailer, but in the trailer the sequence is edited so that Gekko's line occurs as simply "Greed is good." This shorter version of the line has become more popular – and more widely quoted – than the version in the film.
^ This maxim is attributed to several military strategists, notably Sun-tzu, Chinese general.
^ Often misquoted as "Here's another fine mess you've gotten me into!"
^ This paraphrases a line from The Mikado by Gilbert and Sullivan
^ Although occurring in the 1949 film, this line did not become a widespread catchphrase until after the 1961 premiere of Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. In the opening scene of that play, Martha quotes this line and then (since she has apparently forgotten) she asks George which of Bette Davis's films it is from.
^ Often misquoted as "Are you trying to seduce me, Mrs Robinson?"
^ This line, which does not appear in any of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, was first said onscreen in The Return of Sherlock Holmes. The line's first occurrence is in the stage play Sherlock Holmes, written entirely by William Gillette with Doyle's approval, for which Gilette listed Doyle as co-author.
^ An ad-lib. The line, of course, is Ed McMahon's introduction of Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show.
^ Ad-libbed after a particularly good take
^ Usually misquoted as: "No more wire hangers, ever!"
^ Frequently heard as "... Twas beauty killed the beast"
^ This quote is sometimes attributed to Ronald Reagan portraying George Gipp. However, Reagan does not utter the phrase on screen, and the speech is reported by Rockne.
^ Later, "Vodka Martini, Shaken, not Stirred." In the film You Only Live Twice, accidentally "Stirred, not Shaken."
^ appeared in multiple other films.
