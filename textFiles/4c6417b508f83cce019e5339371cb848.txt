"Maternity leave" redirects here. For the episode of Lost, see Maternity Leave (Lost).
Parental leave is an employee benefit that provides paid or unpaid time off work to care for a child or make arrangements for the child's welfare. Often, the term parental leave includes maternity, paternity, and adoption leave.
In most western countries parental leave is available for those who have worked for their current employer for a certain period of time.[1] Sweden is one country which provides generous parental leave: all working parents are entitled to 16 months paid leave per child, the cost being shared between employer and State. To encourage greater paternal involvement in child-rearing, a minimum of 2 months out of the 16 is required to be used by the "minority" parent, in practice usually the father, and some Swedish political parties on the Left argue for legislation to oblige families to divide the 16 months equally between both parents. Norway also has similarly generous leave. In Estonia mothers are entitled to 18 months of paid leave, starting up to 70 days before due date. Fathers are entitled to paid leave starting from the third month after birth (paid leave is however available to only one parent at a time). The amount paid depends on wages earned during previous calendar year - most will receive 100% or full wage but there is an upper limit of three times national average.
The maternal-leave only system in Bulgaria is even more generous, providing mothers with 45 days 100% paid sick leave prior the due date, 2 years paid leave, and 1 additional year of unpaid leave. The employer is obliged to restore the mother to the same position upon return to work. In addition, pregnant women and single mothers cannot be fired.
The most generous maternal/paternal leave system is in Lithuania, where mothers are provided 8 weeks of 100% paid leave before the due date, 100% pay in the first year, 85% in the second year and additional (third) year of unpaid leave. Either mother or father can take the leave, or they can swap in shifts. Additionally father is provided one month of paternal leaver immediately after child's birth.
In 2000, parental leave was greatly expanded in Canada from 10 weeks to 35 weeks divided as desired between two parents. This is in addition to 15 weeks maternity leave, giving a total possible period of 50 weeks paid leave for a mother. There is still no paid leave for new fathers, however. In Canada maternity and parental leave is paid for by the Employment Insurance system.
In the UK, all female employees are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave, 39 weeks of which is paid, with the first six weeks paid at 90% of full pay and the remainder at a fixed rate.
Five countries in the world do not offer some form of paid parental leave - Australia, the United States, Liberia, Swaziland, and Papua New Guinea. However, most employees in Australia are entitled to at least 12 months' unpaid leave for the primary carer, and new parents are able to receive a Baby Bonus of A$5000 paid in 13 fortnightly instalments, which is roughly equivalent to the parental leave payment made to parents in New Zealand. From January 2009, the Baby Bonus has been restricted to parents on a combined income of less than A$150,000.
There is currently a push to expand paid maternity leave in the United States. One organization supporting paid maternity leave in the United States is Moms Rising.[2] Additional information about family leave policies and movements within the United States is available at PaidFamilyLeave.org. It is doing so by appealing to each state legislature individually to obtain maternity leave in that state. The Center for Law and Social Policy is also a leader in the campaign for national paid leave policy and publishes often on the subject.

If a person has worked for their current employer for 26 weeks or more before the 15th week before the due date (and received a salary that is higher than a fixed minimum), they can claim Statutory Maternity Pay. This typically means that the child can not have been conceived before the mother starts a new job. They must give the employer notice before the 15th week before the child is due. People not eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay may be able to receive Maternity Allowance (for example if they have changed jobs while pregnant, are unemployed or self employed, or earn less than a fixed minimum, but they must have been working for 26 of the 66 weeks ending the week before the pregnancy and for 13 of those weeks they must have earned more than 30 pounds per week). People unable to receive either of these benefits may be able to receive other benefits, such as incapacity benefit. Maternity leave can be started up to 11 weeks before the due date. If a woman has a pregnancy-related illness in the last 4 weeks of her pregnancy, her employer can request that her maternity leave begins then, even if she is only off sick for one day. A mother may not start working again for 2 weeks (or 4 weeks if she works in a factory) after the child's birth.[12] Both parents can have an additional 13 weeks unpaid overall (maximum of 4 weeks per year) if they have worked for an employer for over 1 year for a child under 6.

As international organizations are not subject to the legislation of any country, they have their own internal legislation on parental leave.

United Nations[13]
16 weeks 	100% (however, no fewer than 10 weeks must be after delivery, even if the pre-delivery leave was longer due to a late birth)
4 weeks 100% (or 8 weeks for staff members serving at locations where they are not allowed to live with their family)


The fact that a staff member is or will be on parental leave cannot be a factor in deciding contract renewal. To ensure that this is enforced, if a contract ends while the staff member is on parental leave, the contract must be extended to cover the duration of such leave.
