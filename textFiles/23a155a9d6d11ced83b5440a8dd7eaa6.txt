[edit] History
On April 30, 2007, at MIX 2007, Microsoft announced IronRuby, which uses the same name as Wilco Bauwer's IronRuby project with permission.[3] It was planned to be released to the public at OSCON 2007.[4]
On July 23, 2007, as promised, John Lam and the DLR Design Team presented the pre-Alpha version of the IronRuby compiler at OSCON. He also announced a quick timeline for further integration of IronRuby into the open source community.[5]
On August 31, 2007, John Lam and the DLR Design Team released the code in its pre-alpha stage on RubyForge.[6] The source code has continued to be updated regularly by the core Microsoft team (but not for every check-in). The team also does not accept community contributions for the core Dynamic Language Runtime library, at least for now.[7]
On July 24, 2008, the IronRuby team released the first binary alpha version, in line with OSCON 2008.[8] On November 19, 2008, they released a second Alpha version.
The team is actively working to support Rails on IronRuby.[9][10] Some Rails functional tests start to run, but a lot of work still needs to be done to be able to run Rails in a production environment.[11]

[edit] Mono support
IronRuby may run on Mono as it does on Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR), but the IronRuby team only tests it with the CLR on Windows.[12], it does not build on Mono for the moment[13][14]

[edit] .NET interoperability
The interoperability between IronRuby classes and regular .NET Framework classes is very limited for the moment because many Ruby classes are not .NET classes.[15] However, better support for dynamic languages in .NET 4.0 may increase interoperability in the future.[16]

[edit] License
IronRuby is released under the Microsoft Public License, which is OSI-certified and close to a BSD-style license.[17]
