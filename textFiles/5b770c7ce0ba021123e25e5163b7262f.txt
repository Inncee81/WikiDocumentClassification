It is also the seat of government of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, which is ruled by Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan – the current ruling Emir of the UAE. Abu Dhabi lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the Arabic Gulf from the central western coast. Approximately 860,000[2] people lived in Abu Dhabi as of 2007[update]. One of the world's largest producers of oil, Abu Dhabi has actively attempted to diversify its economy in recent years through investments in financial services and tourism.

[edit] History




Qasr al-Hosn, the oldest building in the city of Abu Dhabi showing the The First Tower (1761) seen from the gate


Parts of Abu Dhabi were settled in the 3rd millennium BC and its early history fits the nomadic herding and fishing pattern typical of the broader region. Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation, the Bani Yas, in the late 18th century, which also subsequently assumed control of the town of Dubai. In the 19th century the Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways.
Into the mid-20th century, the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to be sustained mainly by camel herding, production of dates and vegetables at the inland oases of Al Ain and Liwa Oasis, and fishing and pearl diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city, which was occupied mainly during the summer months. Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were, at this time constructed of palm fronds (barasti), with the wealthier families occupying mud huts. The growth of the cultured pearl industry in the first half of the twentieth century created hardship for residents of Abu Dhabi as pearls represented the largest export and main source of cash earnings.
In 1939, Sheikh Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan granted petroleum concessions, and oil was first found in 1958. At first, oil money had a marginal impact. A few lowrise concrete buildings were erected, and the first paved road was completed in 1961, but Sheikh Shakbut, uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last, took a cautious approach, preferring to save the revenue rather than investing it in development. His brother, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi. The ruling Al Nahyan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country. On August 6, 1966, with the assistance of the British, Sheikh Zayed became the new ruler. [3]
With the announcement by the UK in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf area by 1971, Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the United Arab Emirates.
After the Emirates gained independence in 1971, oil wealth continued to flow to the area and traditional mud-brick huts were rapidly replaced with banks, boutiques and modern highrises.

[edit] Location




Satellite image of Abu Dhabi (March 2003)






Abu Dhabi seen from SPOT satellite


The emirate of Abu Dhabi is located in the oil-rich and strategic United Arab Emirates and is an active member of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). It borders with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (south) and the Sultanate of Oman (east). The emirate borders the emirate of Dubai to its northeast. In the north is the Persian Gulf.
Abu Dhabi city is on an island located less than 250 metres from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and Mussafah Bridges. A third bridge, designed by Zaha Hadid, is currently under construction. Bridges connecting to Reem Island and Saadiyat Island are also under construction and should be completed in 2011.
Most of Abu Dhabi is located on the island itself, but it has many suburbs on the mainland for example: the Khalifa A, Khalifa B, Rhaha Beach, Between Two Bridges, Baniyas and Mussafah Residential.

[edit] Language and literature
The majority of the inhabitants of Abu Dhabi are expatriate workers from India, Pakistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Philippines, the United Kingdom and various countries from across the Arab world. Consequently, English, Tagalog, Tigrinya, Amharic, Bengali, and Urdu are widely spoken. Apart from Urdu and Hindi spoken by Indians, many Indian expatriates also contribute other South Asian languages to the cultural milieu, including Malayalam, widely spoken in Kerala.
The native-born population are Arabic-speaking Persian Gulf Arabs who are part of a clan-based society. The Al Nahyan family, part of the al-Falah branch of the Bani Yas clan, rules the emirate and has a central place in society.

[edit] Current ruler
Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan is the hereditary ruler of Abu Dhabi (UAE). He is a son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first president of the United Arab Emirates. His half-brother, General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and wields considerable influence as Chairman of Abu Dhabi's Executive Council and Deputy Supreme Commander of Abu Dhabi's armed forces.

[edit] Economy

Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest emirate of the UAE in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per capita income. The average net worth for Abu Dhabi's 420,000 citizens is AED 62 million (US$ 17 million), and more than $1 trillion is invested worldwide in this city alone. The GDP per capita also reached $63,000 [4], which is far above the average income of the United Arab Emirates and which ranks third in the world after Luxembourg and Norway. Abu Dhabi is also planning many future projects sharing with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) and taking 29% of all the GCC future plannings. The United Arab Emirates is a fast-growing economy: in 2006 the per capita income grew by 9%, providing a GDP per capita of $49,700 and ranking third in the world at Purchasing power parity. Abu Dhabi plays a large role in the world economy. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), currently estimated at US$ 875 billion, is the world's wealthiest sovereign fund, in terms of total asset value.[5] Etihad Airways maintains its headquarters in Abu Dhabi.[6]

[edit] Climate
Sunny/blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months of April through September are generally hot and humid with maximum temperatures averaging above 40 °C (104 °F). During this time, sandstorms also occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility down to a few meters.
The weather is cooler from November to March. This period also sees dense fog on some days. The oasis city of Al Ain, about 150 km (93 mi) away, bordering Oman, regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country; however, the dry desert air and cooler evenings make it a traditional retreat from the intense summer heat and year round humidity of the capital city.[7]

[edit] Transport




Interior of Abu Dhabi airport.


Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH) serves this city. Private vehicles and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city. There is a 2 AED pick-up fee plus 0.50 AED per kilometre. There are bus routes to nearby towns such as Baniyas, Habashan and Al Ain, among others. A service to Dubai (about 160 km/99 mi away) started in 2005.

[edit] Taxi transport
There are three main types of taxis in Abu Dhabi: the expensive ones owned by transport companies, which tend to start at AED 15.00; the silver 'new' ones, which are gradually replacing the white-and-gold 'old' taxis and are slightly more expensive. A few Filipinos are employed in the taxi industry, though the vast majority are Pakistanis who tend to be affectionately known as khans.

[edit] Bus transport
On 30 June 2008 the Department of Transport began public bus service in Abu Dhabi with four routes.[9] All routes were free until the end of 2008 in an attempt to entice people to use the bus system.[10] The four routes, which operate between 06:00 and 00:00 every day, come at a frequency of 10 to 20 minutes.[10]
Within the first week of service, the bus network had seen high ridership. Some of the buses, which have a maximum capacity of 45 passengers, only had room for standing. Some bus drivers have reported as many as 100 passengers on the bus at one time.[11] Although the new, free bus service has been a success, many taxi drivers are losing business. Taxi drivers have seen a considerable decrease in the demand for taxis while lines were forming for the buses.[12]
In addition to the current four routes, six routes are expected to be added in August 2008.[10] In 2009, the Department of Transport plans to have 21 bus routes in the city. A total of 1,360 buses are expected to be in operation by 2010.[11]

[edit] City planning




A Public Park in the City






Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum Street (formerly Airport Road)


The city was planned in the 1970s for an estimated maximum population of 600,000. In accordance with what was considered to be ideal urban planning at the time, the city has wide grid-pattern roads, and high-density tower blocks.
On the northerly end of the island, where the population density is highest, the main streets are lined with 20-story towers. Inside this rectangle of towers is a normal grid pattern of roads with lower density buildings (2 story villas or 6 story low-rise buildings).
Abu Dhabi city is a modern city with broad boulevards, tall office and apartment buildings, and busy shops. Principal thoroughfares are The Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street.
Abu Dhabi city is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens.
Mail is generally delivered to post-office boxes only; however, there is door-to-door delivery for commercial organizations. There are many parks (or public gardens) throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however there is often an entry fee for adults. The city has a "Corniche," or seaside promenade, about 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) in length, with gardens, playgrounds, and a BMX/Skateboard ring.
The design of the inner city roads and main roads are quite organised. All horizontal streets (starting from Corniche street, St. # 1) are odd and the verticals are evenly numbered. So Corniche is Street #1, Khalifa is Street # 3, Hamdan is Street # 5, and so on. While Salam Street is St # 8.[13]
Abu Dhabi has since established in 2007 the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council (UPC), the agency responsible for the future of Abu Dhabi’s urban environments, and the expert authority behind the visionary Plan Abu Dhabi 2030 Urban Structure Framework Plan published September 2007. The UPC is also working on similar plans for the Region of Al Ain and Western Region.

[edit] Planning problems




A street in Abu Dhabi city.



The city's population far surpasses the original estimated maximum population when it was designed. This causes traffic congestion, a shortage of car parking spaces, and overcrowding.


Although there is an addressing system for the city, it is not widely used, and so causes problems in describing building locations. This means directions must often be given based on nearby landmarks.


The lack of a comprehensive, reliable, and frequent public transport system has led to a near complete dependence on private cars and taxis as a means of transport. The addition of free public transportation in the form of public buses has lightened the congestion on the roads recently, and plans to build light railway connections between the center and the airport, and onwards towards Dubai, have been announced.


[edit] Future development
New developments on islands surrounding the city plan to increase the population of the city by up to 2,600,000. These developments will put the city on par with the other major city of UAE, Dubai.
The government of Abu Dhabi has announced plans to fund a campus for New York University, the first of its kind to be established by a major US research university outside of the United States. The university is expected to receive students by 2010.[14]

[edit] Culture and the arts
Abu Dhabi is trying to position itself as the "Cultural hub" of the Middle East, taking this mantle from regional cities such as Beirut, Tel Aviv and Cairo. It is home to a number of cultural institutions including the Cultural Foundation and the National Theater. The Cultural Foundation is home to the UAE Public Library and Cultural Center. Various cultural societies such as the Abu Dhabi Classical Music Society have a strong and visible following in the city. The recently launched Emirates Foundation makes grants in support of the arts, as well as to advance science and technology, education, environmental protection and social development. The International Prize for Arabic Fiction (IPAF) will be based in Abu Dhabi.

The creation of a major "up-scale cultural district" on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island has begun with the groundwork for a US$200 million Guggenheim Museum. The Frank Gehry-designed museum will display a "prestige collection" of modernist and contemporary art and is scheduled for completion in 2011. Upon completion, it is expected to be the largest exponent of the prestigious Guggenheim Museums.[15] In addition, there will be three further cultural focal points [16]: The Performing Arts Centre, The Sheikh Zayed National Museum and The Maritime Museum.


[edit] Events
Abu Dhabi stages hundreds of conferences and exhibitions each year in its state-of-the-art venues, including the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC). Another major event is the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC). Since 1998, the city has been host to the Abu Dhabi Combat Club Submission Wrestling World Championship, an event that regularly brings together practitioners of Jiu-Jitsu, Wrestling, Judo, Sambo, Shooto and Mixed Martial Arts from around the world to compete in several weight classes as well as an "absolute" division.
Abu Dhabi is planning to stage the biggest fireworks display in the world as part of the celebrations to mark UAE national day.[17]

[edit] Education
Abu Dhabi is home to several international and local private schools and universities. These schools and universities boast several languages that make up the population of Abu Dhabi.
