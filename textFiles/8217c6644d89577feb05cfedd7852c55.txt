[edit] History
IBM introduced the first three ThinkPad models, the 700, 700C, 700T, in October 1992.[1] The 700C used the Microsoft Windows 3.1 operating system, 25 MHz 486SLC processor, 120 MB hard disk drive, the industry's first 10.4″ TFT color display,[1] 2.2″ × 11.7″ × 8.3″ dimension (56 × 297 × 210 mm), and 3 kg (6.5 lb) weight, cost US$ 4,350. The design of the commercial versions differed significantly from the prototype's keyboard-less tablet design. The bright red TrackPoint, embedded in the keyboard, enabled the notebook to be used on an airline tray table without a mouse. An IBM researcher conceived the title "ThinkPad" from a corporate-issued leather-bound pocket notebook with the corporate motto 'Think' embossed on the cover.[1] The name met disagreements from the IBM corporate naming committee because the nomenclature system for the IBM computers was then numerical; however, the brand name "ThinkPad" was kept as the press showed appreciation for the title.[2] The first ThinkPads were very successful, and soon collected more than 300 awards for design and quality.[3]
The ThinkPad 750 flew aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour during a mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope on December 2, 1993. The ThinkPad 750C's task was to run a NASA test program which determined if radiation inherent in the space environment causes memory anomalies in the 750C or generates other unexpected problems.[4] In 1995, the average number used was five, and in 1999 the average number was nine. Throughout 2006, a ThinkPad A31p was being used in the Service Module Central Post of the International Space Station and seven ThinkPad A31p laptops were in service in orbit aboard the International Space Station.[5]
ThinkPads have been praised for exceptional build quality, system reliability, and services throughout their decade and a half of presence in the consumer market. The original design was a collaboration between Tom Hardy, corporate manager of the IBM Design Program, Italian-based designer Richard Sapper (noted then for the design of the Tizio lamp and later commissioned to design a ballpoint for Lamy) and Kazuhiko Yamazaki, lead notebook designer at IBM's Yamato Design Center in Japan. Sapper proposed a design inspired by the Shōkadō bentō, a traditional black-lacquered Japanese lunch box.[6]
The fold-out butterfly keyboard, which appeared in the ThinkPad 701 series, is widely considered a design masterpiece and is on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The ThinkPad 760 series also included an unusual keyboard design; the keyboard was elevated by two arms riding on small rails on the side of the screen, tilting the keyboard to achieve a more ergonomic design.
The 755CV featured another interesting design quirk: the screen could be separated from the lid, allowing it to be used to project the computer display using an overhead projector, before data projectors were commonplace.[7]

[edit] Lenovo purchase
In 2005 the Chinese manufacturer of ThinkPads, Lenovo, purchased the brand from IBM, in a five year deal whereby IBM still helps in the marketing and support of these products.

Added Magnesium-alloy chassis roll cage to reduce motherboard flex caused by holding the laptop one handed on a corner.
Added Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic to 15″ ThinkPad Models.
Reintroduced a line of Tablet PCs based on the X series.
Moved the physical location of GPU to the edge of motherboard near hinge to reduce the chance of damage caused by motherboard flex.
Introduced Widescreen displays with the Z series of ThinkPads and added the option of Widescreen to the T series models.
Brought back a consumer friendly laptop under the Z series line of ThinkPads.
Added rubber cushion to the hard drive tray to reduce vibration and to absorb shock.
Added the Windows key to all models of the 60- and 61-series making all the Windows shortcuts possible. (Although possible before with the keyboard remapping utility)
Added Magnesium-alloy lid roll cage for a sturdier lid while replacing the lid material from magnesium-alloy to plastic for better wireless signal reception.[8]
Official support for Linux.[9]
Added second drainage hole starting with the Z60 series
Ported the ThinkPad keyboard into stand-alone keyboards for desktop PCs in PS/2 or USB flavor. [10]
Added user forum on its website where actual ThinkPad developers and engineers view and reply to posts. [11]

The ThinkPad contains an intercooling mechanism that allows the computer's interworks to remain cool throughout its use. Its creator also placed vents, a draining mechanism, which allows any spilled material to drain through the computer without wrecking the keyboard.

The ThinkPad has introduced many innovations, including the TrackPoint pointing device. ThinkLight, an LED keyboard light at the top of the LCD screen, Active Protection System, an accelerometer sensor which detects when a ThinkPad is falling and shuts the hard drive down to prevent damage, Roll-cage design to eliminate motherboard flex, Biometric fingerprint reader, Client Security Solution, which improves security using a built-in TPM and facilitates deployment in corporate environment and drain holes to help reduce damages to the keyboard and components from accidental spillage.

[edit] Model information




Several ThinkPads in use aboard the International Space Station, including 760, 770, and A31p models.



ThinkPad 235
The Japan-only ThinkPad 235 (or Type 2607), is an interesting product because it is a progeny of the IBM/Ricoh RIOS project. Also known as Clavius or Chandra2, it contains unusual features like the presence of 3 PCMCIA slots and the use of dual camcorder batteries as a source of power. Features an Intel Pentium MMX 233 MHz CPU, support for up to 160 MB of EDO memory, and a built-in 2.5-inch (64 mm) hard drive with UDMA support. Hitachi markets Chandra2 as the Prius Note 210.
ThinkPad 240
The ultraportable ThinkPad 240 (X, Z) started with an Intel Celeron and went up to the 600 MHz Intel Pentium III. The RAM was expandable to 320 MB max with a bios update. With a 10.4-inch (260 mm) screen and an 18 mm key pitch (A standard key pitch is 19mm). They were also one of the first ThinkPad series to contain a built-in Mini PCI card slot (form factor 3b). The 240s have no optical drives and an external floppy drive. An optional extended battery sticks out the bottom like a bar and props up the back of the notebook. Weighing in at 2.9 pounds (1.3 kg) these were the smallest and lightest ThinkPads ever made.
ThinkPad 300 series
The 300 series (300, 310, 340, 350, 360, 365, 380, 385, 390 (all with various sub-series)) was a long-running value series starting at the 386SL/25 processor, all the way to the Pentium III 450. They were a bit large and slower than the more full-featured models but offered a less expensive ThinkPad.
ThinkPad 500 series
The 500 series (500, 510, 560 (E, X, Z), 570 (E)) were the main line of the ultraportable ThinkPads. Starting with the 486SX2-50 Blue Lightning to the Pentium III 500, these machines had only a hard disk onboard. Any other drives were external (or in the 570's case in the ultrabase). They weighed in at around 4 pounds (1.8 kg) and because of their excellent design are still in use today.
ThinkPad 600 series
The 600 series (600, 600E and 600X) are the direct predecessors of the T series, and are known for their portability, comfortable keyboard, and sturdy construction. The 600 series packed a 12.1" SVGA or a 13.3" XGA TFT LCD, Pentium MMX, Pentium II or III processor, full-sized keyboard, and optical bay into a package weighing roughly 2.3 kg (5 lb). IBM was able to create this light, fully featured machine by using lightweight but strong carbon fibre composite plastics. The battery shipped with some 600 series models had a manufacturing defect that left it vulnerable to memory effect and resulted in poor battery life, but this problem can be avoided by use of a third-party battery.
ThinkPad 700 series
The 700 series (700, 701, 720, 730 (tablet), 750, 755, 760, 765, 770 (many with sub-models)) were the cutting-edge Intel-based ThinkPads. They featured the best screens, largest hard drives and fastest processors available at the time. This was the first successful ThinkPad introduced in 1992 (the first ThinkPad was a tablet PC without a keyboard and a mouse).
ThinkPad 800 series
The ThinkPad 800 series (800/820/821/822/823/850/851/860) were unique in that they were based on the PowerPC architecture, rather than the Intel x86 architecture. They all used the PowerPC 603e CPU, at speeds of 100 MHz, or 166 MHz in the 860 model. The 800 may have used a 603, and it is unclear if the 800 was experimental or not. All units used SCSI 2 instead of IDE hard disks. The units are believed to have all been extremely expensive, as the 850 cost upwards of $12,000. The 800 series can run Windows NT 3.5 (probably 4.0 as well), OS/2, AIX 4.14, Solaris Desktop 2.5.1 PowerPC Edition, and Linux.
ThinkPad TransNote
The ThinkPad TransNote was a pen-based PC in a notebook. Data could be entered through the keyboard, TrackPoint, paper notepad (with writing sensor below), or the screen via stylus. This ThinkPad expanded on IBM's previous pen based notebooks (360P(E), 730T(E), and 750(P)).
ThinkPad A series
The A series was developed as an allround productivity machine, equipped with hardware powerful enough to make it a desktop replacement. Hence it was the biggest and heaviest ThinkPad series at its time, but also had features not even found in a T series of the same age. The A series was dropped in favour of the G series and R series.
ThinkPad G series
The G series consisted of only three models, the G40, G41 and G50. Being large and heavy machines, equipped with powerful desktop processors, this line of ThinkPads was consequently specialised in serving as a desktop replacement.
ThinkPad i series
The i series introduced the ThinkLight and were also the first notebooks equipped with Wireless LAN.





Lenovo ThinkPad R500






Lenovo ThinkPad R500 (lid closed)



ThinkPad R40 series
This line of notebooks comprised the R40 and the R40e. These had Mobile Celeron, Pentium 4-M or Pentium M processors, depending on sub-variant.
ThinkPad R50 series
Based on the T40 series, this line of notebooks includes the R50, R50e, R50p, R51, R51e and R52. This series of notebooks is available with fingerprint-readers and uses many components also found in T40-series models, such as batteries, keyboards and planars (system boards). The R51e and the R52, both based on the T43 system board, are the first R-series notebook to utilize DDR2-memory and include a SATA-controller, however uses only PATA-harddrives.
ThinkPad S30 and S31
Japan & Taiwan-only Pentium III model with no CD drive, a 10-inch (250 mm) screen, 256MB Maximum RAM, PCMCIA slot, CF slot, 2 USB 1.1 ports, Firewire port, RJ11 and RJ45, and a keyboard with English and Japanese shared keys. Battery with built-in stand, long life 5 hr run. HDD 20 GB upgradeable to 160 GB tested. Some models have built-in WiFi. BIOS are interchangeable in S30 and S31 and tested to work. The latest known BIOS is 1.82.
ThinkPad T20 series
Comprising the T20, T21, T22 and T23, these were Mobile Pentium III or Mobile Pentium III-M, sub-5 lb (2.3 kg) class machines. Contained processors ranging from 0.18 micrometre Mobile Pentium III 650 MHz to 0.13 micrometre Mobile Pentium III-M 1.20 GHz. Typically had 14.1-inch (360 mm) XGA screens, Ultrabay 2000 optical drives, S3 Savage/IX-MV graphics chip and Cirrus Logic CS 4614/22/24 sound chips; although variations along the line existed. Introduced the ThinkLight, a LED mounted inside the upper screen lip that illuminates the keyboard (activated with Fn-PgUp, the extreme diagonal keys); and titanium-reinforced and rubberized screen lids. Used MiniPCI form factor cards, which could be modem and/or Ethernet. With the T23, an internal WiFi antenna became available, so WiFi miniPCI cards could be used. These models did not contain the active hard drive protection or touchpad pointing device which appeared in later models. They were clad in black non-slip rubber with embedded glitter. The case lid had tabs along the edge that interlocked with depressions in the lower case when closed, to reduce case flexing. Comparatively more stylish, functional, and rugged machines; and easy to disassemble for repair or upgrades. The T23 machine, known internally in IBM as the 'Toronto' model, the first to include Windows XP, is acknowledged by many as having the best keyboard on any laptop computer[citation needed].
ThinkPad T30
Features include an Intel Mobile Pentium 4 processor ranging from 1.6 GHz to 2.4 GHz. A T30 may accommodate up to a 2.4 GHz processor with the latest BIOS and Embedded Controller upgrades. Graphics are provided by ATI Radeon Mobility 7500 hardware with 16 MB of discrete video memory, which supports external widescreen resolutions. Users have even reported success with output resolutions of 1920x1200 via DVI on the optional Port Replicator II docking station, although IBM claims a limit of 1280x1024 due to a weak TMDS transmitter. The T30 was available with a 14.1-inch (360 mm) screen, with resolutions of 1024 x 768 and 1400 x 1050. DVI video output is available with the optional Port Replicator II docking station, but resolution is officially limited to 1280x1024.[12] Features available include the embedded security subsystem, UltraNav touchpad, 256 MB standard memory (1 GB maximum according to IBM manual, but it has been reported[13] to accept 2 GB of RAM[14]), a 20, 40 or 60 GB hard disk, Ultrabay Plus drive, wireless, and Bluetooth. The T30 also contains a miniPCI slot usable for a wireless card. The shell is titanium-reinforced composite. The whole package was a bit heavier and thicker than the T4x series.





An ultraportable IBM X31 with an IBM T43 notebook



ThinkPad T40 series
Includes the T40, T41, T42, T43, and associated "p" series (for "performance"; e.g., T43p). A typical 14.1-inch (360 mm) T4x weighs 2.2 kg (4.9 lb), slightly less than the 600 series, and features an Intel Pentium M Processor (ranging from the Intel Pentium M at 1.3 GHz to the Intel Pentium M 770 at 2.13 GHz), a 14.1 or 15-inch (380 mm) LCD (XGA, SXGA+), an integrated GPU (Intel Graphics Media Adapter 900) or a discrete GPU (Radeon x300, 7500, 9000, Fire GL 9000, 9600, Fire GL T2, X300, and Fire GL V3200), and a hard drive ranging in size from 30 to 100 GB with the Active Protection System to protect the hard drive (T41 and later models). "p" (mobile workstation) models are also available with a 14-inch (360 mm) SXGA+ or a 15-inch (380 mm) SXGA+/UXGA FlexView display with wide viewing angle and high density IPS technology. These 15-inch (380 mm) display models weigh slightly more than their lesser brethren, with optical drive and battery, at 2.7 kg (5.9 lb). All T4x models use either 6-cell or 9-cell lithium-ion batteries, as well as an optional 4-cell Ultrabay Slim lithium-polymer battery. The 9-cell battery gives a runtime of 5+ hours and a crease allowing the notebook to lay flat on an airplane tray-table. Some T42 and T43 models feature a biometric security system with built-in fingerprint reader. Some types of the model also had the option to include Bluetooth support. The T40 was IBM's first ThinkPad to use the Pentium M "Banias" CPU. The T42 employed a Pentium M "Dothan" processor with a 400 MHz frontside bus, while the T43 used a later revision Dothan running a 533 MHz FSB.
ThinkPad T60 series
Includes the T60, T61; and associated "p" series (for "performance"; e.g. T60p); intended as the next generation of the T4x Series ThinkPads; this is the first T Series ThinkPad to include the Intel Core Duo "Yonah" Technology, and later the Intel Core 2 Duo "Merom" Mobile technology; and the first T-series ThinkPads to come in widescreen resolution. This model has a VMX-enabled BIOS (although the lowest end Intel Core CPUs themselves do not support VMX, such as the T5500), meaning that running fully virtualised operating systems via Xen or VMware is possible. The T61, announced in May 2007, features a widescreen resolution as the default resolution, and incorporates the Intel Santa Rosa platform having a fully 64-bit chipset, and is the first T-series ThinkPad to have an integrated web camera (optional), smart card reader (optional), and media card reader (optional). Furthering innovation founded in the T60, the T61 also sports a top-cover roll cage, aside from the magnesium roll cage inside the main chassis. T61 extra features include a fingerprint reader (some models, also available on T60) and a new improved framing (all T61 models).
ThinkPad T400 and T500 series
updated T61 series. Notable features include switchable graphics (ability to switch between discrete and integrated graphics) and LED backlit screens.
ThinkPad W Series
A recent line of mobile workstations designed to suit the needs of CAD/CAM users, 3D and Video artists and photographers. These are the most powerful ThinkPads ever made.
ThinkPad X20 series
Pentium III Mobile, sub-4 lb machines. Contained Pentium III-M processors ranging from 500 MHz to 1.13 GHz. 12.1 inch XGA screens, and ATI Rage Mobility M1 (X20, X21) or Radeon Mobility M6 (X22, X23, X24) graphics chips. Used miniPCI form factor cards, which supports modem and/or Ethernet. With the X22 and later machines, provisions for wireless networking support are built into the chassis. Ultrabay 2000 optical drive support can be fitted via the Ultrabase portable docking station option, and extended batteries can give the series a 5-hour running time.
ThinkPad X30 series
Pentium III Mobile (X30), Pentium M Banias (X31) or Pentium M Dothan (X32), 12.1 inch XGA screens, dedicated Graphic Chip (ATI M6 with 16 MB, which means no shared memory is cut from the RAM), Bluetooth on some models (upgradable), WLAN (802.11b, b/g or even a/b/g), FireWire, CompactFlash card slot. No built-in optical drive. Lots of options like second battery, Mediaslice (for battery and UltraBay), port replicators, docking stations (some with a PCI slot).
ThinkPad X40 Series
An example of the lightweight X series, weighing in at 1.2 kg (2.7 lb), 25% lighter than its predecessor, the X31. The last variant of the X40 series, the X41 Tablet, was the first ThinkPad tablet PC since the original pen-based ThinkPad. It is the lightest 12" Tablet PC with a keyboard from any manufacturer. It was also the final released ThinkPad designed by IBM before the brand was purchased by Lenovo. (The X40 was known internally in IBM as the 'Sydney' model)
ThinkPad X60 series
Includes the X60 and X61, with their associated "s" and "Tablet" series. The X60 is first X Series ThinkPad to feature Intel chips using the Intel Core architecture. The Core Duo L2400 (Low Voltage) CPU on the X60s model achieves 7+ hours of battery life on standard benchmarks, and can reach around 10 hours under light use, when using the extended-life battery. Note this model lacks a built-in optical drive, unlike the larger T60. The X61, like the T61, also is the first X-series ThinkPad to use Intel's Santa Rosa platform. This series includes the Thinkpad Reserve Edition, a 5,000 model limited edition laptop designed for executive class professionals. It was clad in hand-stitched leather, and came with a 3 year 24/7 service warranty.
ThinkPad X200 series
Successor to the X60 series, the ThinkPad X200 notebook is packed with a host of new technologies that include a Solid State Drive (SSD), an optional integrated camera, 12.1" widescreen display, a new 9-cell battery for extended running time up to 9.8 hours, weight as low as 2.95 lbs, and CPU up to 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.
ThinkPad X300/301
Codenamed "Kodachi". Released February 26, 2008. Distinguished from other ultraportables by its usage of LED backlighting, removable battery, solid state drive, and integrated DVD burner, it is the flagship model for the X-series. It also integrates GPS, WWAN, and a webcam in the top lid. The thickest part of the notebook is 2.34 cm (0.92 inches)and the thinnest part is 1.85 cm (0.73 inches). X301 is a revision with newer, more powerful Intel processors.
ThinkPad Z60 series
This is the first ThinkPad to feature a widescreen (16:10 aspect ratio) display. The Z Series is also the first ThinkPad equipped with a titanium lid (on some models). Integrated WWAN and/or webcam also found on some configurations. The series includes, as of 2006, the Z60 and Z61; the latter of which is the first Z Series ThinkPad with Intel "Yonah" Dual Core Technology. The processor supports Intel VT; this is disabled in the BIOS but can be turned on thanks to a BIOS update. Running fully virtualised operating systems via Xen or VMware is therefore possible.[15]


[edit] Reception
Both IBM and Lenovo-manufactured ThinkPads have been recognized by the press for their reliability. Laptop Magazine states that the ThinkPad has the highest-quality laptop computer keyboard available.[16] The ThinkPad was ranked #1 in reliability and support according to PC Magazine's 2007 Survey.[17] The Lenovo ThinkPad is the PC Magazine 2006 Reader's Choice for PC based laptops, and ranked number 1 in Support for PC based laptops.[18] The ThinkPad Series is the first product line that has received PC World's Hall of Fame award. [19] The ThinkPad X Tablet series is PC Magazine Editor's Choice for tablet PCs. [20] The 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) ThinkPad X60s is ranked number 1 in ultraportable laptops by PC World. It lasted 8 hours and 21 minutes on a single charge with its 8 cell battery.[21] The Lenovo ThinkPad X60s Series is on PC World's Top 100 Product of 2006. [22]The 2005 PC World Reliability and Service survey ranked ThinkPad products ahead of all other brands for reliability.[23] In the 2004 survey, they were ranked second (behind eMachines)[24] Lenovo was named the most environment-friendly company in the electronics industry by Greenpeace in 2007. [25] Lenovo ThinkPad T60p received the Editor's Choice award for Mobile Graphic Workstation from PC Magazine. [26] Lenovo ThinkPad X60 is the PC Magazine Editor's Choice among ultra portable laptops.[27]

[edit] Criticism
There have been concerns and complaints about the service, support, hardware, and security before and after Lenovo acquired the ThinkPad line. For example:

IBM EasyServ has been outsourced to Solectron.[28] The default depot repair is now handled by Solectron, and there have been complaints about unsatisfactory repairs and charges from users.[29][30][31]
Many who ordered T60s or T61s between May 9 and May 24, 2007 did not receive their orders when promised due to a variety of problems at Lenovo.[32]
Lenovo in Canada has a buggy ordering system that causes delayed delivery time and results in customers' frustration. [33]
Many IBM ThinkPad models give a no-1802 error when trying to install "unauthorized" wireless cards. This prevents users from starting up their computers unless the wireless mini-PCI card is removed, or an IBM-authorized card is used. However, there are workaround patches.[34]
The latest SL series lacks several of the otherwise common key features of a ThinkPad, such as the Roll Cage or the ThinkLight.
15" displays with 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution are no longer offered, including the popular IPS flexview.


For the T500, Lenovo switches from using the keyboard's stiffener plate to using a stiffer chassis to reduce weight, which results in a more rigid keyboard [35] . Many feel that the new keyboard flexes more, even though Lenovo's own deformation test shows the new keyboard to perform better by 0.03mm (0.001181 inches). [36]
