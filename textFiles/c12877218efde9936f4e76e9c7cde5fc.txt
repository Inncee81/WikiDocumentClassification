A media center system


The term media center refers either to a dedicated computer appliance or to a specialized personal computer software, both of which are adapted for playing various kinds of media (music, movies, photos etc.), and it usually has a a 10-foot user interface design to be used in living-room TV with a remote control. A media center may also allow watching DVD movies and watching and recording television broadcasts.
The media itself may be stored, received by terrestrial, satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet. Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on a (wireless) network attached storage. Some software is capable of doing other tasks, such as finding news (RSS) from the Internet. Media centers are often operated with a remote control, connected to a television set for video output, and can sometimes function as a normal personal computer.
A media center can be purpose-built, modified or created by individuals by adding media center software to a PC or some other computer, for example an Xbox. Lately, some video game consoles (Playstation 3 and Xbox 360) with their network services can act as a media center devices by default.

[edit] Functionality and advantages
Typically, complete media centers offer the following functions to the user:

Integration of all forms of media, entertainment and communication functions including TV-reception (analogue TV, DigitalTV via terrestrial-, cable-, satellite-, IPTV-, webTV-networks), broadband Internet access, radio, IP-telephony, video-telephony, e-mail etc. into one common user friendly GUI (graphical user interface) controlled with a remote control or wireless keyboard by the family members typically in the living room
Ability to receive digital media files (via direct video signal, computer network or USB)
Ability to store digital media (usually on a standard computer hard disk drive)
Ability to play back digital media through standard television or hi-fi equipment
Simplicity (compared to a computer equipped to accomplish transfer, storage and TV/hi-fi playback)
Cost savings (compared to a computer equipped to accomplish transfer, storage and TV/hi-fi playback)
Portability (compared to a computer equipped to accomplish transfer, storage and TV/hi-fi playback)

Though media centers are often built using similar components to personal computers, they are often smaller; media centers sometimes have hardware that is not usually seen in personal computers, such as receivers for remote controls, or television tuner cards. Media centers have not seen widespread popularity but are starting to take hold in the UK and the United States.

[edit] Common applications




The MythTV media center software's main menu.


There are several common applications for which media centers are beginning to gain popularity. Simply put, any application requiring the playback of digital media based files, but not requiring the full features and flexibility of a personal computer stands to benefit from the reduced size, reduced complexity and reduced cost of media centers when compared to similarly equipped PCs.
Common applications include :

Digital Sign Systems
Automotive Entertainment Systems (i.e. limousines, tour buses, car stereos)
In flight/room entertainment and Video On Demand Systems
Mobile sales professionals
Portable collections for travelers and audio/video enthusiasts
