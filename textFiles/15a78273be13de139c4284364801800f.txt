[edit] Overview




"Dharma Juggler", by Gunther Berkus, 1997. Early Poser 1 / Bryce composite image. The original Poser wireframe image has been enhanced using Adobe Photoshop.


Poser is a 3D rendering software package for the posing, animating and rendering of 3D polymesh human and animal figures. Akin to a virtual photography studio, Poser allows the user to load actors, props, lighting and cameras for still and animated renderings.
Natively using a subset of the Alias object (OBJ) file format and a text-based markup for content files, Poser comes with a basic library of human, animal, robotic, and cartoon figures.
Poser also includes poses, hair pieces, props, textures, hand gestures and facial expressions. As Poser does not allow for original modeling of objects, a large community market of merchants and artists creating, selling and marketing third-party Poser content emerged.
Poser is available in English, Japanese, German and French for both Windows and Macintosh platforms.

[edit] Features
Poser 6.0 comes with a host of features, such as the inclusion of "Primitive" zygotes; spheres, cubes and other shapes at both low and high resolution. As with Poser 5.0, it is compatible with 3ds Max, LightWave and Maya, which enables Poser 6.0 to render more than simply people. Indeed, Poser has become almost limitless in the characters it can render. As a result of its huge third-party community, many models are available, such as spaceships, aliens, weapons and other such props.

[edit] Usage
Poser has become a popular tool for digital artists creating original images featuring human figures. It is used for both individual images ("pin-ups") and comics. While Poser has animation capability, this use is less common. However, Poser animation can be seen in industrial applications, such as the animated instructions for checkout machines in Albertsons, Save-On stores and Wal-Mart. Poser figures and animations have been seen in some computer games from budding game creators (Desert Rifle-Qi games and Cake shop-Elefun games).
In addition, an aftermarket has grown up around the trade and sales of ready-made Poser content. Individuals produce models and textures for human figures, props, scenes, animals, etc.

[edit] Library
The Poser 7 package comes with many already-installed features that do not have to be purchased at an online store. These are stored in the "Library." The Library includes:

Figures, which contains human, animal, cartoon, dinosaur, insect, wildlife, and many other poser figures that have a multitude of animation tools to work with.
Poses, There are poses for almost every figure, and there are many human poses from sleeping to picking something up to fighting.
Expressions, which contains any expression imaginable, or close to it.
Hair, which has many types of hairstyles to place on the characters.
Props, which contains objects like clothes and chairs.
Lights, which contains many ways to light your scene.
Cameras, which contains many camera angles.


[edit] Program history
Poser was created by artist and programmer Larry Weinberg, as a software replacement for artist's mannequins. Versions 1.0 and 2.0 were published by Fractal Design; in 1997, Fractal Design was acquired by MetaCreations, and Poser's interface was redesigned by MetaCreations' Phil Clevenger for release as Poser 3 in 1998. This interface has remained as the basis for all subsequent versions. In 1999, MetaCreations sold Poser to egi.sys AG, who established the subsidiary Curious Labs, with Larry Weinberg as CEO, to handle Poser development and publication. Curious Labs, and Poser, were sold to the publisher, e frontier, in 2003. On 15 November 2007 Smith Micro Software announced the purchase of Poser, Anime Studio and Manga Studio from e frontier.[1]
