From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

There are a number of different Greek words for love, as the Greek language distinguishes how the word is used. Ancient Greek has four distinct words for love: agape, eros, philia, and storgē. However, as with other languages, it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words. Nonetheless, the senses in which these words were generally used are given below.

Agapē (αγάπη agápē) means "love" in modern day Greek, such as in the term s'agapo (Σ'αγαπώ), which means"I love you". In Ancient Greek it often refers to a general affection rather than the attraction suggested by "eros"; agape is used in ancient texts to denote feelings for a good meal, one's children, and the feelings for a spouse. It can be described as the feeling of being content or holding one in high regard. The verb appears in the New Testament describing, amongst other things, the relationship between Jesus and the beloved disciple. In biblical literature, its meaning and usage is illustrated by self-sacrificing, giving love to all--both friend and enemy. It is used in Matthew 22:39, "Love your neighbour as yourself" (see also Great Commandment), and in John 15:12, "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you" (see also New Commandment), and in 1 John 4:8, "God is love." However, the word "agape" is not always used in the New Testament in a positive sense. II Timothy 4:10 uses the word in a negative sense. The Apostle Paul writes,"For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved (agapo) this present world...." Thus the word "agape" is not always used of a divine love or the love of God. The Christian sense of the term deepens the original Greek sense and encompasses a total commitment or self-sacrificial love for the thing loved. A great deal of Christian theology is influenced by the frequency of this word in the New Testament and traditional interpretation of the difference between φιλία and αγάπη. John 21 is a great example in which the difference between the words has, in popular circles, been strongly emphasized. However, both the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament) and the New Testament both use αγάπη more frequently than φιλία. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish the difference in meaning between these two words throughout the book of John itself. And of great importance is the apparent interchangeability between the two words in the Septuagint, frequently being used alternately to translate the same Hebrew words.


Eros (love) (ερως érōs) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Modern Greek word "erotas" means "(romantic) love". However, eros does not have to be sexual in nature. Eros can be interpreted as a love for someone whom you love more than the philia love of friendship. It can also apply to dating relationships as well as marriage. Plato refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. It should be noted Plato does not talk of physical attraction as a necessary part of love, hence the use of the word platonic to mean, "without physical attraction". Plato also said eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty, and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. The most famous ancient work on the subject of eros is Plato's Symposium, which is a discussion among the students of Socrates on the nature of eros.


Philia (φιλία philia), which means friendship in modern Greek, a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept developed by Aristotle. It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality and familiarity. In ancient texts, philos denoted a general type of love, used for love between family, between friends, a desire or enjoyment of an activity, as well as between lovers. This is the only other word for "love" used in the ancient text of the New Testament besides agape, but even then it is used substantially less frequently. It also is used of God's love for Jesus and the relationship between Jesus and the beloved disciple.


Storge (στοργή storgē) means "affection" in ancient and modern Greek; it is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring. Rarely used in ancient works, and then almost exclusively as a descriptor of relationships within the family. It is also known to express mere acceptance or putting up with situations - as in "loving" the tyrant.


Thelema (θέλημα thélēma) means "desire" in ancient and modern Greek; it is the desire to do something, to be occupied, to be in prominence. It is also used in the New Testament in the phrase "will of the flesh" to describe sexual intercourse John 1:13.
