Elections for the United States Senate were held on November 4, 2008, with 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate being contested. Thirty-three seats were regular elections; the winners were eligible to serve six-year terms from January 3, 2009, to January 3, 2015, as members of Senate Class II. There were also two special elections: one in Wyoming and another in Mississippi; the winners serve the remainder of terms that expire on January 3, 2013, as members of Senate Class I.
The 2008 presidential election, many gubernatorial elections, and elections for all House of Representatives seats occurred on the same date, as well as many state and local elections.
Going into the 2008 election, the Senate consisted of 49 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and two independents (Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut) who caucused with the Democrats.[1] Of the seats up for election in 2008, 23 were held by Republicans and 12 by Democrats. In the 111th Congress, the Democrats hold 56 seats in the Senate, with the two independents continuing to caucus with the Democrats for a total of 58. The result in Minnesota is currently being contested in court, with Democrat Al Franken holding a narrow lead over Republican incumbent Norm Coleman. For the second time in a row, no incumbent Democratic senators lost their seats. Because there were no open Democratic seats, the election was also the second cycle in a row where no seats switched from Democratic to Republican. Democrats defeated four Republican incumbents: Ted Stevens of Alaska, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, and Gordon Smith of Oregon. Democrats also picked up open seats in Colorado, New Mexico, and Virginia.

[edit] Hill committees’ role
Each major party has Hill committees that work to support its candidates for the House and Senate, chiefly by providing funds. On the Senate side, the committees are the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).
In this cycle the DSCC was more successful at fundraising. As of June 30, 2008, data from the Federal Election Commission showed the NRSC with $24.6 million on hand, as compared with the DSCC's $43 million.[2] The NRSC chair, Senator John Ensign, took the unusual step of chastising the Republican Senators who, like him, are not facing re-election, and who he thought should have done more to help raise money for their colleagues.[2]

[edit] Results by state

[edit] Democratic gains

[edit] Alaska
Main article: United States Senate election in Alaska, 2008
Dispelling rumors that he would retire due to advanced age (he was 84 years old on election day) and ongoing federal investigations into his conduct, Senator Ted Stevens filed papers for re-election for an eighth term.[7]
An ex-oil company executive, Bill Allen, paid for part of the renovation costs on Stevens's personal residence. The FBI investigated the remodeling of Stevens home by Veco Corp., which is part of a broader corruption investigation involving Stevens's son, former State Senate President Ben Stevens.[8] Two former Veco executives have plead guilty to paying the younger Stevens $242,000 in bribes.[9] On July 30, 2007, the IRS and FBI raided Stevens's home in Alaska. On September 14, 2007, former Veco CEO Bill Allen testified at the trial of former State House Speaker Pete Kott that Veco paid people working to double the size of Stevens's home.[10]
On July 29, 2008, a federal grand jury indicted Stevens on seven felony counts for making false statements[11], and on October 26, a jury found Stevens guilty on all charges.[12]
The Democratic candidate was Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich, the son of popular former Democratic Representative Nick Begich. Begich announced his candidacy for the Senate seat on April 22, 2008.[13]
On October 19, 2007, the AP reported that despite the allegations and FBI probe, several veteran GOP Senators—including Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), and Kit Bond (R-MO)—donated enough money to Stevens's re-election campaign to make it one of Stevens's most successful fund raising quarters ever.[14]
Sen. Stevens' conviction on seven felony counts of corruption put his reelection bid in serious jeopardy, coming just over a week before the election, though Stevens appealed the conviction. Nevertheless, Stevens was narrowly ahead in the vote count after election day, with only about two-thirds of all votes counted. It only became clear Begich had prevailed when early votes, absentee ballots, and questioned ballots were counted.
On November 18, the race was called for Begich, who won with 47.8% to Stevens' 46.2%.

[edit] Colorado
Main article: United States Senate election in Colorado, 2008
On January 15, 2007, incumbent Senator Wayne Allard (R) announced he would not seek re-election, honoring his pledge to serve no more than two terms.[15]
Former Representative Bob Schaffer of Fort Collins was the Republican nominee. Former Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway was rumored to be considering a run, but declined to do so.[16] Other possible Republican candidates included former Congressman Scott McInnis and Colorado Attorney General John Suthers.
The Democratic nominee was 2nd district Congressman Mark Udall of Boulder who announced on January 15, 2007, that he would seek the seat and did not draw significant primary opposition.[17]
Other candidates included Bob Kinsey of Denver as the Green Party nominee,[18] Douglas "Dayhorse" Campbell as the American Constitution Party's nominee ,[19], and Independent candidate Buddy Moore, unaffiliated any party.[20]
On Election Day, Udall defeated Schaffer 52%-43%

[edit] Minnesota
Main article: United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008
The 2008 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota featured first-term Republican incumbent Senator Norm Coleman, Democrat Al Franken, a comedian and radio personality, and former U.S. Senator Dean Barkley, a member of the Independence Party of Minnesota.
A December 2007 poll showed Coleman's approval rating among Minnesota voters at 53%.[21] The seat was heavily targeted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee because of Minnesota's Democratic leanings and recent Democratic gains in national and statewide elections. These factors, coupled with a national political climate favorable to Democrats, made the Minnesota Senate race one of the most competitive and closely watched of the cycle.
Franken announced his candidacy on February 14, 2007, more than 20 months before the election.[22] Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, a professor at the University of St. Thomas (St. Paul, Minnesota), joined the race in October 2007.[23] Attorney Mike Ciresi, an unsuccessful candidate in the 2000 Democratic U.S. Senate primary, was considered a serious candidate, but withdrew from the race on March 10, 2008, clearing the path for Franken to secure the party's nomination.
Barkley ran under the banner of the Independence Party, the largest third party in Minnesota.[24][25] He was included in most of the debates and ultimately received 15% of the vote in the general election, a strong showing for an independent candidate. It is not clear whether Barkley detracted more votes from Coleman or Franken.
Polls over the course of the campaign indicated that the race was very competitive, many showing Franken and Coleman virtually tied or within the margin of error, as well as several showing each candidate with a significant lead at one point or another. The presence of a serious third party candidate further complicated matters.
On November 4, 2008, Coleman received 1,211,590 votes to Franken's 1,211,375 votes, a margin of 215 votes, far less than 0.1% percent, thereby triggering an automatic recount. Barkley received 437,404 votes, about 15% of total votes cast.[26]
On January 3, 2009, with the recount apparently completed, Franken had an unofficial lead of 225 votes, but former Senator Coleman's attorneys are contesting the official results in the courts.[27] In the meantime, Minnesota is being represented by only one senator.
On April 13, 2009, a three-judge panel ruled that Al Franken received the most votes in Minnesota's 2008 Senate race and ruled against Coleman's claims on all counts.[28] Coleman has vowed to appeal.[29]

[edit] New Hampshire
Main article: United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2008
Senator John Sununu represents the swing state of New Hampshire. The state traditionally leaned Republican, but John Kerry from neighboring Massachusetts narrowly won the state in the 2004 Presidential election. New Hampshire also saw major Democratic gains in the 2006 elections, when Democrats took both of the previously Republican-held House seats, the gubernatorial race with a record vote share of 74%, and majorities in the State House and Senate, giving them concurrent control of both bodies for the first time since 1874. However, New Hampshire had not elected a Democratic United States Senator since 1975.
Sununu's 2002 opponent, former Governor Jeanne Shaheen, decided to run and was generally considered to be a very formidable challenger.[30] Three consecutive monthly Rasmussen Reports poll showed Shaheen defeating Sununu by 49% to 41%.[31] Prior to Shaheen's entry, Portsmouth Mayor Steve Marchand,[32] Katrina Swett, wife of former Democratic congressman Richard Swett,[33] and former astronaut Jay Buckey[34] had announced that they were running for the Democratic nomination. After Shaheen's entry, however, all three withdrew and endorsed the former governor.
On election day, Shaheen defeated Sununu, 52% to 45%.

[edit] New Mexico
Main article: United States Senate election in New Mexico, 2008
While Senator Pete Domenici had declared that he would seek re-election in New Mexico, he changed his mind and announced on October 4, 2007 that he was retiring at the end of his current term due to a degenerative brain disorder.[35] Domenici normally would have been expected to win re-election easily, having won his current term with the support of two out of three New Mexico voters; however, he is to be investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for his role in firing U.S. Attorney David Iglesias. Domenici's role in the developing scandal had reduced the probability he would have been re-elected, and a SurveyUSA poll showed his approval ratings at 41%, with 54% disapproving.[36] The potential scandal may have also contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.
Tom Udall, the popular Representative from New Mexico's 3rd District, was the Democratic nominee. The Republican nominee was Rep. Steve Pearce, who represented the more conservative southern part of the state.
When asked whether the Republicans were abandoning their hopes of holding onto Domenici's seat, Senator John Ensign, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded that "You don’t waste money on races that don’t need it or you can’t win.”[37]
Udall won the election with 61% of the vote, with Pearce taking 39%.

[edit] North Carolina
Main article: United States Senate election in North Carolina, 2008
In North Carolina, there had been rumors that Senator Elizabeth Dole would retire from the Senate and run for governor, but she said in 2006 that she intended to run for re-election.[38] There was early speculation that North Carolina Governor Mike Easley might be pressured into running against her but this did not come to pass.[39] The Democratic nominee was state Senator Kay Hagan,[40] who defeated Jim Neal and Dustin Lassiter in the Democratic primary. A Rasmussen poll released May 11, 2008 showed Hagan leading Dole by a statistically insignificant margin, 48% - 47%,[41] suggesting a competitive race. Hagan's poll numbers continued to best Dole's, however, and Hagan defeated Dole by a wider than expected margin of 53% to 44%.

[edit] Oregon
Main article: United States Senate election in Oregon, 2008
Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon ran for a third term. He defeated ophthalmologist Gordon Leitch[42] in the May 20 Republican primary. Smith faced Democratic Oregon House of Representatives Speaker Jeff Merkley in the November general election. Merkley beat longtime Democratic activist Steve Novick and three other candidates in a hotly contested primary.[43]
In a July 16, 2008 poll, Merkley overtook Smith for the first time 43% to 41%. [44]
On November 6, 2008, Jeff Merkley was projected the winner of the contest, with 48.9% to Smith's 45.6%. Gordon Smith has formally conceded. [45]

[edit] Virginia
Main article: United States Senate election in Virginia, 2008
John Warner announced on August 31, 2007 that he would not seek re-election for another term.[46] Former Governor Jim Gilmore, who dropped out of the 2008 presidential election, was the Republican nominee for the seat.[47] Popular Democratic former Governor Mark Warner (no relation) was the Democratic nominee for the race.[48] Polling showed him as a strong favorite to win the seat.[49]
When asked whether the Republicans were abandoning their hopes of holding onto Warner's seat, Senator John Ensign, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded that "You don’t waste money on races that don’t need it or you can’t win.”[37]
In one of the first senate races called on election day, Warner won, taking 64% of the vote, with Gilmore winning 34%. Since Democrat Jim Webb had defeated incumbent Republican George Allen for Virginia's other Senate seat in 2006, Virginia's senate delegation flipped from entirely Republican to entirely Democratic in just two years.

[edit] Democratic holds

[edit] Arkansas
Main article: United States Senate election in Arkansas, 2008
Despite being a first-term senator in a state George W. Bush won twice, Democrat Mark Pryor faced no opposition from Republicans in his re-election bid. Although Bush carried the state twice, Arkansas Democrats swept the seven state races held in the 2006 general election. Pryor is the son of longtime U.S. Senator and former Arkansas Governor David Pryor. It was rumored that Lt. Governor Bill Halter would challenge Pryor in the primary, but Halter declined to file as a candidate.[50] Rebekah Kennedy of the Green Party was Pryor's only opposition.
Pryor won on election day, with 74% of the vote. Kennedy took 19%.

[edit] Delaware
Main article: United States Senate election in Delaware, 2008
On August 23, 2008, the Democratic nominee for President, Barack Obama, announced that Biden would be joining him on the ticket as the Vice Presidential nominee.[51] Delaware law allowed Biden to run for Vice President and Senator at the same time, so he would have kept the seat if the ticket had lost. On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama won the presidential election, making Biden the next VP. The Governor of Delaware will appoint a replacement until a special election can take place. Depending on the date of Biden's resignation from the Senate, his successor will be appointed by either the current governor (Democrat Ruth Ann Minner) or her successor, Democrat Jack Markell. Biden's Republican opponent in the Senate race, conservative political commentator Christine O'Donnell, tried to make an issue of Biden's dual campaigns, claiming that serving his constituents is not important to him.
Biden was reelected with 65% of the vote, or 257,484 votes. O'Donnell received 140,584 votes (35% of the vote).

[edit] Illinois
Main article: United States Senate election in Illinois, 2008
Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin remained favored in Illinois. He sought to be re-elected in a state that has steadily become more Democratic since 1992. CQpolitics.com rated the contest as "safe Democrat."
Physician Steve Sauerberg of La Grange won the February 5 Republican primary.[52] Kathy Cummings, a retired special education teacher was nominated via convention by the Green Party.[53] Chad Koppie, a retired airline pilot and vice-chairman of the Illinois Center Right Coalition, was the nominee of the Constitution Party.
Durbin won with 63% of the vote. Sauerberg had 33%.

[edit] Iowa
Main article: United States Senate election in Iowa, 2008
In a state that has been trending to the Democratic party recently, Senator Tom Harkin faced the Republican nominee, small business owner Christopher Reed, who he defeated with 63% of the vote to Reed's 37%.

[edit] Louisiana
Main article: United States Senate election in Louisiana, 2008
Incumbent Mary Landrieu was elected in 1996 following a recount and was narrowly re-elected in 2002 in a runoff election. Since those elections, Democrats have had to endure the loss of some reliable voters because Hurricane Katrina dispersed many African-Americans from New Orleans, although the vast majority still live within Louisiana. The state has become more Republican over the past 12 years. Louisiana elected David Vitter in 2004, the state's first Republican senator since Reconstruction. And Louisianans elected Republican Bobby Jindal as the first Indian-American Governor in the country's history in 2007. Louisiana's electoral votes easily went to George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.
On August 27, 2007, state Treasurer John N. Kennedy announced he was switching parties from Democrat to Republican. On November 29, after being personally recruited by Vitter and former Bush administration official Karl Rove, Kennedy announced plans to challenge Landrieu in 2008.[54][55] An August 19 poll by Rasmussen Reports shows Landrieu leading Kennedy by a 53% to 37% margin.[56]
In the end, Landrieu was re-elected with 52% of the vote, Kennedy having 46%.

[edit] Massachusetts
Main article: United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2008
Incumbent John Kerry sought another Senate term in Massachusetts.[57] Republican author and conservative activist Jerome Corsi, known for his public criticism of Kerry, had stated that he would run for the seat in 2008 but later changed his mind. Jim Ogonowski, a retired Air Force pilot who was closely defeated by now-Representative Niki Tsongas in a 2007 special election, was running against Kerry.[58] but failed to obtain the required candidacy signatures. The Republican challenger turned out to be Jeff Beatty, an ex-Army Delta Force officer who garnered 30% of the vote in a challenge to Democratic Congressman Bill Delahunt in 2006. Kerry was challenged by defense attorney Edward O'Reilly for the Democratic nomination, winning 69 percent of the vote to O'Reilly's 31 percent.
As expected, Kerry won with 66% of the vote to Beatty's 31%. Libertarian Robert J. Underwood had 3%.

[edit] Michigan
Main article: United States Senate election in Michigan, 2008
With the Democratic Party takeover of Capitol Hill in the 2006 midterm elections, Senator Carl Levin has become one of the most powerful people in Washington as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He was expected to easily win re-election.
Challenging Levin were Republican State Representative Jack Hoogendyk, Green candidate Harley G. Mikkelson, US Taxpayers' candidate Mike Nikitin, Libertarian professor Scotty Boman, and Natural Law's candidate Doug Dern. [59]
As expected, Levin won re-election with 63% of the vote, to Hoogendyk's 34%.

[edit] Montana
Main article: United States Senate election in Montana, 2008
Senator Max Baucus is a popular Democrat in Montana, representing a state that has long been fairly Republican but also is receptive to Democrats in state and local elections. President Bush won Montana by more than 20 points in both 2000 and 2004, but Montana also has a popular Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer, and a newly elected Democratic junior senator, Jon Tester. Baucus was not expected to face a significant challenge from the 85 year old Republican nominee, Bob Kelleher, who surprised observers by winning the June 3 Republican primary despite supporting a number of positions that put him to the political left of Baucus, such as nationalization of the American oil and gas industry.[60]
Baucus easily won re-election, taking 73% of the vote, with Kelleher taking 27%.

[edit] New Jersey
Main article: United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2008
Senator Frank Lautenberg sought re-election in 2008, though he was 84. In the Primary, Lautenberg soundly defeated Representative Rob Andrews (NJ-1) by a margin of 62% to 32%. In November 2006, the senator had the lowest approval rating of any Democrat running for re-election in 2008 (with 39% approving and 45% disapproving),[61] with his approval standing only at 42% as of September 2007 with voters saying he does not deserve re-election 46%-36%.[62] The Republican nominee was former Congressman and 1996 senatorial candidate Dick Zimmer.
Sara Lobman of the Socialist Workers Party and Independent Anthony Fisher were also declared candidates.[63][64] Furthermore, in the wake of the financial crisis, Carl Peter Klapper entered the race as a write-in candidate.[65]
Lautenburg won re-election, winning 56%-42%.

[edit] Rhode Island
Main article: United States Senate election in Rhode Island, 2008
In Rhode Island, Democratic Senator Jack Reed had an approval rating of 66% in November 2006.[66] National Journal has declared that "Reed is probably the safest incumbent of the 2008 cycle". Reed's opponent was Robert Tingle, a pit manager at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, whom Reed defeated in his re-election campaign in 2002.[67] A July 7 Rasmussen poll had Reed leading Tingle 72% to 20%.[68]
Reed won the election as expected, with 73% of the vote.

[edit] South Dakota
Main article: United States Senate election in South Dakota, 2008
In South Dakota, Senator Tim Johnson's seat was considered a top GOP target in 2008, considering Johnson's narrow 524-vote victory in 2002 over then-Representative and current U.S. Senator John Thune, as well as his recent health problems. Johnson underwent surgery in December 2006 for a Cerebral arteriovenous malformation and was discharged from the hospital on April 30, 2007. On October 19, 2007, Johnson formally announced that he is seeking re-election.[69] According to a November 2006 SurveyUSA poll, Johnson has an approval rating of 70%, with just 26% disapproving of his performance,[70] making him an early favorite despite the state's Republican leaning.
Republicans were unsuccessful in persuading Governor Mike Rounds and former Lieutenant Governor Steve Kirby to run. State Representative Joel Dykstra announced his candidacy on July 5, 2007. Other Republicans included Charles Lyonel Gonyo and Sam Kephart. Dykstra won the Republican primary on June 3.
Johnson was re-elected, with 62% to Dykstra's 38%.

[edit] West Virginia
Main article: United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2008
Senator Jay Rockefeller, great-grandson of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, sought a fifth term representing West Virginia. Even though West Virginia is a historically Democratic state, in which the party had a 50-32% edge in party affiliation over the Republicans in the 2004 elections, the state party is more conservative than the national party, giving its votes to President George W. Bush in that election and in 2000.[71] Democrats Sheirl Fletcher and Billy Hendricks challenged Rockefeller in the primary but were defeated. The Republican nominee was Jay Wolfe of Salem, a former State Senator.
As expected, Rockefeller handily won on election day, being re-elected with 64% of the vote. Wolfe had 36%.

[edit] Republican holds

[edit] Alabama
Main article: United States Senate election in Alabama, 2008
Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions sought re-election to a third term. Johnny Swanson announced his candidacy in March 2006 for the Democratic nomination.[72]
Despite voting heavily for Bush in 2004, Alabama still has a strong Democratic presence; Democrats control majorities of both chambers in the state legislature. Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries Ron Sparks appeared to be preparing for a run, but on June 12, 2007, Sparks announced that he will not seek the Senate seat, in order to avoid a primary battle with state Senator Vivian Davis Figures.[73] Figures has won elections in the Republican-leaning Mobile area. In the Democratic primary, Figures won the nomination and will face Sessions in November.
Not on the ballot, but running a write-in campaign, was Darryl W. Perry, the 2004 Libertarian Party nominee for Pennsylvania State Treasurer and 2007 candidate for Mayor of Birmingham, Alabama.[74][75] Perry was endorsed by Alabama Statesmen,[76] Boston Tea Party,[77] Christians for Life and Liberty[78] and PaulCongress.com[79]
Session defeated Figures, taking 63% of the vote to Figures' 37%

[edit] Georgia
Main article: United States Senate election in Georgia, 2008
In the 2008 election, first-term incumbent Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss was opposed primarily by Democrat Jim Martin, as well as third party candidates, including Libertarian Allen Buckley and Eleanor Garcia of the Socialist Workers Party.
Martin, current Georgia Commissioner of Human Resources, former member of the Georgia General Assembly, Vietnam War veteran, and 2006 candidate for Lieutenant Governor, secured the Democratic nomination after defeating Dekalb County CEO Vernon Jones by a 59% to 41% margin in the August 5 run-off election.
In December 2007, Chambliss had an approval rating of 53% and a disapproval rating of 34% according to Strategic Vision, a Republican polling firm.[80] For most of the campaign, Chambliss maintained a comfortable lead in most polls. However, in the weeks leading up to the 2008 general election, polls showed the race tightening, reflecting a general nationwide trend.
On November 4, 2008, Chambliss received 49.7% of the vote,[81] with Martin about 3% behind and Buckley receiving 3% of the vote.[82] However, Georgia law states that if no candidate receives a simple majority of the popular vote, then the election will be decided in a run-off. On December 2, 2008, Chambliss won the run-off with 57% of vote to Martin's 43%.[83]

[edit] Idaho
Main article: United States Senate election in Idaho, 2008
On September 1, 2007, Senator Larry Craig announced his intent to resign from the Senate effective September 30, 2007.[84] The announcement followed by just six days the disclosure that he had pleaded guilty on August 1, 2007 to a reduced misdemeanor charge arising out of his arrest on June 11 at the Minneapolis airport for soliciting sex with a man in the restroom. Craig found almost no support among Republicans in his home state or Washington. On October 4, 2007, Senator Craig announced he will not seek re-election, but would remain in office until the end of his term.[85]
Lieutenant Governor Jim Risch was the Republican candidate; U.S. Army veteran and former congressman Larry LaRocco was the Democratic candidate.[86] Risch and LaRocco ran against each other in the 2006 Lieutenant Governor race, which Risch won by a wide margin. The latest poll by Rasmussen Reports shows Risch leading LaRocco by a 58% to 30% margin [3]. Libertarian Kent Marmon is also running.[87] The last Democratic Senator from Idaho was Frank Church, who was defeated in the Republican landslide of 1980 after serving four terms.
Risch won the election with approximately 58 percent of the vote.[88]

[edit] Kansas
Main article: United States Senate election in Kansas, 2008
Senator Pat Roberts sought re-election to a third term. Although Kansas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932, former Democratic Congressman and army veteran Jim Slattery was nominated to run against Roberts. Pat Roberts currently has an approval rating of 56%.[89]
Roberts was re-elected with 60% to Slattery's 36%.

[edit] Kentucky
Main article: United States Senate election in Kentucky, 2008
Democrats made Senate Minority Leader, four-term Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky a target due to his leadership of Senate Republicans and his ties to President Bush, as well as his mediocre approval rating in the state, which is below 50%.[90]
Businessman and U.S. Army veteran Bruce Lunsford, who lost the 2007 Democratic gubernatorial primary to current Governor Steve Beshear, was the Democratic nominee.
Once thought to be secure in his reelection, McConnell's lead had shrunk dramatically thanks to the financial crisis and recent polling showed the race tightening between him and Lunsford. [91] Nevertheless, McConnell was re-elected by a margin of 53% to 47%.

[edit] Maine
Main article: United States Senate election in Maine, 2008
In Maine, Susan Collins sought a third term in the Senate. She has maintained a high approval rating, and also in her favor is the landslide re-election of Maine's senior Senator, Olympia Snowe, who had the largest margin of victory of any GOP Senate candidate - besides the largely-unopposed Richard Lugar (R-IN) - in the 2006 election cycle. Collins was re-elected with 58% of the vote in 2002 over State Sen. Chellie Pingree. Sen. Joe Lieberman, citing his status as an independent, endorsed Sen. Collins in her 2008 re-election bid.
On May 8, 2007, Rep. Tom Allen (ME-1) announced his candidacy on his website. He had already expressed interest in running and had been building the apparatus necessary to wage a Senate campaign.[92]
Collins won on election day with 61% of the vote, compared to 39% for Allen.

[edit] Mississippi
Main article: United States Senate elections in Mississippi, 2008
Incumbent Senator Thad Cochran announced that he would seek re-election for a sixth term.[93] Cochran, who has not faced serious opposition since he was re-elected in 1984, faced Democratic state Representative Erik R. Fleming, whom he defeated with 62% of the vote.

[edit] Mississippi (special)
Main article: United States Senate elections in Mississippi, 2008
Roger Wicker, formerly the representative of Mississippi's 1st congressional district, was appointed by Governor Haley Barbour on December 31, 2007, to fill the vacancy caused by the December 18 resignation of Trent Lott.[94][95] It had been speculated that Lott wished to resign before a new lobbying reform law, effective the first day of 2008, took effect; having resigned before the end of 2007, Lott may become a lobbyist in 2009 instead of 2010.[95] Controversy arose when Barbour called for the special election to be held on the same day as the general election. As a result, Mississippi's Attorney General Jim Hood challenged Barbour in court, claiming that the special election needed to be held within 100 days of Lott's resignation, as per state law.[96] Initially, a Mississippi Circuit Court judge sided with Hood, ruling that the election take place on or before March 19, 2008.[97] However, Barbour filed an appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which overturned the earlier ruling and set the special election for November 4, 2008.[98][99]
Democratic former Governor Ronnie Musgrove challenged Wicker. Another Democrat, former Congressman Ronnie Shows, also filed to run, but he withdrew in February 2008 and endorsed Musgrove.[100][101] Wicker beat Musgrove 55% to 45%.

[edit] Nebraska
Main article: United States Senate election in Nebraska, 2008
In Nebraska, incumbent Republican Senator Chuck Hagel chose to retire rather than run for a third term.
Former Governor Mike Johanns, who recently resigned as Agriculture Secretary, was the Republican nominee, having defeated opponent Pat Flynn 87-13 in the primary. Scott Kleeb, 2006 candidate for Nebraska's 3rd congressional district, defeated businessman Tony Raimondo, a former Republican, by a wide margin in the Democratic primary.
Nebraska state Green Party Co-Chairman Steve Larrick was also a candidate,[102] as was Kelly Rosberg of the Nebraska Party.
Johanns won, taking 58% of the vote, with Kleeb taking 40%

[edit] Oklahoma
Main article: United States Senate election in Oklahoma, 2008

[edit] South Carolina
Main article: United States Senate election in South Carolina, 2008
Senator Lindsey Graham, as a popular Republican incumbent in strongly conservative South Carolina, has been considered unlikely to be vulnerable to a Democratic challenge. Graham's support for a compromise immigration bill, however, drew an angry response from many South Carolina conservatives, who recruited Buddy Witherspoon, a former South Carolina Republican Party leader, to challenge Graham for the nomination. Graham easily bested Witherspoon in the June 10 primary.[104]
First-time candidate Bob Conley, an airline pilot, was the Democratic nominee.[105] Conley, whose victory in the Democratic primary was a surprise, is a former Republican who supported Ron Paul this year and has campaigned as the more conservative candidate on some issues, notably illegal immigration and the bailout of Wall Street.
The South Carolina Working Families Party nominated Michael Cone, who also ran for the Democratic nomination. This was the first time the party had nominated a candidate for statewide office.[106] However, Cone was not listed on the ballot in South Carolina. [107]
Graham easily won re-election with 58% of the vote to Conley's 42%.

He was certified March 3, 2008 by the Tennessee Division of Elections as having achieved ballot access for the November 4, 2008 election as a candidate for United States Senate.

[edit] Texas
Main article: United States Senate election in Texas, 2008
Texas has not elected a Democrat in a statewide election since 1994, but according to pre-election Rasmussen polling, Senator John Cornyn had an approval rating of 50%.[111] Texas House of Representatives member and Afganistan War veteran Rick Noriega secured his place as Cornyn's Democratic challenger in the March 4 primary, beating out opponents Gene Kelly, Ray McMurrey, and Rhett Smith. The same Rasmussen poll showed Cornyn leading Noriega by a narrow four percentage points - 47% to 43%.
Christian activist Larry Kilgore of Mansfield, Texas, was a Republican challenger for the March 2008 primary election, but Cornyn easily won the Republican primary.[112]
There were three Libertarians, including 2006 LP senate nominee Scott Jameson, running for their party's nomination.[113] In addition, the Green Party of Texas sought ballot access for its candidate David B. Collins.[114]
In the end, John Cornyn won re-election, 55%-43%

[edit] Wyoming
Main article: United States Senate elections in Wyoming, 2008
Senator Mike Enzi was considered likely to be re-elected without significant opposition for a third term in strongly Republican Wyoming. His Democratic opponent was Chris Rothfuss, a professor at the University of Wyoming and a chemical engineer, nanotechnologist, and diplomat. Pre-election polling indicated that Enzi led Rothfuss by 24%.
As expected, Enzi won another term, 76%-24%.

[edit] Wyoming (special)
Main article: United States Senate elections in Wyoming, 2008
John Barrasso was appointed by Governor Dave Freudenthal (D) on June 22, 2007 to fill the senate seat of Republican Craig L. Thomas, who died on June 4.[115] Wyoming law requires that the interim senator be affiliated with the same political party as the departed senator. Barrasso ran in the November 4, 2008 special election, held on the day of the 2008 presidential election, to serve out the remainder of Thomas' term, which expires in January 2013.[116]
On the Democratic side, Casper City Councilman Keith Goodenough announced his candidacy.[117] In the primary on August 19, Goodenough was defeated by a political newcomer, Gillette defense attorney Nick Carter, who became Barrasso's opponent in the general election.[118]
