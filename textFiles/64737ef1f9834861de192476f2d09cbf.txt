From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Core fonts for the Web was a project begun by Microsoft in 1996 to make a standard pack of fonts for the Internet. The project was terminated in August 2002, allegedly due to frequent EULA violations.[1] However, that same EULA allows redistribution if the packages are kept in their original format and filenames and not used to add value to commercial products. As a result, they are still available for download on third-party websites.
For Windows, the fonts are provided as standard executables, however they each include an embedded cabinet file, which can be extracted with appropriate software. This allows the fonts to be used on non-Windows operating systems, so long as they are distributed in original form. For the Macintosh, the files are provided as BinHexed Stuff-It archives.
Even though the fonts are legally [2] available from SourceForge and other Web sites and are included with Mac OS, Håkon Wium Lie (CTO of Opera Software) cited the cancellation of the project as an example of Microsoft resisting interoperability.[3]
In July 2007, Apple announced that it had renewed its licensing agreement with Microsoft for these fonts.[4]

[edit] Successors
In Windows Vista and Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft introduced ClearType Font Collection, which consists of 6 font families: Calibri, Cambria, Candara, Consolas, Constantia, Corbel. Version 1 of the fonts can be found in Microsoft's free Office 2007 viewers and converters, while version 5.00 of the fonts are shipped with Vista.
Cariadings, the only Symbol encoded font in the ClearType Font Collection, was initially announced to be available with Vista,[5] but is unavailable in the final Vista release.[6] The font is available commercially from Ascender for $20.
