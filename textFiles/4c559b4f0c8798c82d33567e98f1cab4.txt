[edit] List of former trademarks that have become generic terms
Main article: Genericized trademark
The following list contains marks which were originally legally protected trademarks, but which have subsequently lost legal protection as trademarks by becoming the common name of the relevant product or service, as used both by the consuming public and commercial competitors. Some marks retain trademark protection in certain countries despite being declared generic in others.

Aspirin - Still a Bayer trademark name for acetylsalicylic acid in about 80 countries, including Canada and many countries in Europe, but declared generic in the U.S.[1]
Cellophane[2] – Originally a trademark of DuPont[3]
Dry ice[4] – Trademarked by the Dry Ice Corporation of America in 1925[5]
Escalator – Originally a trademark of Otis Elevator Company[6]
Heroin[7] – Trademarked by Friedrich Bayer & Co in 1898[8]
Kerosene[9] – First used around 1852
Lanolin – Trademarked as the term for a preparation of sheep fat and water[10]

Touch-tone – Dual tone multi-frequency telephone signaling; AT&T states "formerly a trademark of AT&T"[16]
Trampoline – Originally trademarked by George Nissen[17][18] for the generic "rebound tumbler"
Videotape - Originally trademarked by Ampex Corporation[19], an early manufacturer of audio and video tape recorders.
Webster's Dictionary – The publishers with the strongest link to the original are Merriam-Webster, but they have a trademark only on "Merriam-Webster", and other dictionaries are legally published as "Webster's Dictionary"[20]
Yo-Yo – Still a Papa's Toy Co. Ltd. trademark name for a spinning toy in Canada, but declared generic in the U.S. in 1965[21]
Zipper – Originally a trademark of B.F. Goodrich[22]


[edit] List of protected trademarks frequently used as generic terms
Marks in this list are still legally protected as trademarks, but are sometimes used by consumers in a generic sense. Unlike the names in the list above, these names are still widely known by the public as brand names, and are not used by competitors. Scholars disagree as to whether the use of a recognized trademark name for similar products can truly be called "generic", or if it is instead a form of synechdoche.[23] The previous list contains trademarks that have lost their legal status in some countries, while the following list contains marks which have been registered as trademarks, continue in use, and are actively enforced by their trademark owners. Writing guides such as the AP Stylebook advise writers to "use a generic equivalent unless the trademark is essential to the story."
