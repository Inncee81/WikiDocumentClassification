SyncToy is a free PowerToy designed by Microsoft that provides an easy to use graphical user interface that can automate synchronizing files and folders. It is written using Microsoft's .NET framework. SyncToy 2.0 was rewritten to make use of the Microsoft Sync Framework.[1]
SyncToy can manage multiple sets of folders at the same time; it can combine files from two folders in one case, and mimic renames and deletes in another. SyncToy can keep track of renames to files and will make sure those changes get carried over to the synchronized folder.

[edit] Features
Users initially need to create a “folder pair” that represents the two folders ("left" and "right" folders) to be compared and synchronized. These folders can be on the local drive, on an external device such as a flash drive or camera, or on a network share from another computer. SyncToy supports UNC paths. It provides a Browse option to find the folder or network share, or users can type it in directly. SyncToy offers two safeguards to ensure that the user does not lose files permanently when they are deemed unnecessary during a sync. Firstly, a user can preview what is going to happen when the sync takes place, without actually changing anything; secondly, any deleted files are moved to the Recycle Bin.
SyncToy defines five different types of operations to synchronize two folders: Synchronize, Echo, Subscribe, Contribute, and Combine. A Synchronize operation takes the two folders and makes sure they have the exact same files. To do this, SyncToy may copy files in either direction and may delete or rename files in either folder. The Echo operation looks for changes (new files, renames, deletes) in the left folder and makes them in the right folder (one-way sync). A Contribute option is like an Echo, but it does not delete any files on the right folder that may have been deleted on the left folder. With Subscribe, the two folders are examined to see what files they have in common. If either the left or right side has updated these common files, only those files are synchronized. Any of the other files in the folders are untouched. Finally, the Combine operation just copies new files in both directions, without deleting anything. SyncToy doesn’t consider a renamed file to be new, so it is possible to have the same file under different names on the left and right folder after they have been combined. The Combine and Subscribe options were removed in SyncToy version 2.0.
If users obtain unexpected results it may be that copying the address of a folder from Windows Explorer into the boxes for folder pair creation needs to be terminated by a back-slash (\), otherwise the final subfolder will be ignored and the operations performed over possibly many more subfolders than intended.[citation needed] The user manual is highly ambiguous in places, and there is much uncertainty about the actual logic applied, so there is no substitute for experiments on copies of folders to ensure intended outcomes.[citation needed] Part of the uncertainty for the novice user derives from the fact that the actual logical description depends upon the status obtained through previous history of use of the SyncToy tool.[citation needed]

[edit] SyncToy 2.0
SyncToy has been upgraded for a version 2.0 release, available to download from Microsoft's website. It features a redesigned sync engine for better performance and scalability. It also includes better support for unattended synchronization runs, x64 compatibility, support for synchronizing encrypted files, file and folder exclusion based on both names and file types, renaming folder pairs and detection of drive letter reassignment.[2]

[edit] File Corruption
Certain file types (including JPEG images and WMA audio files) become corrupted when synchronised to some Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices. The corruption happens to the files stored on the NAS itself. This is something that affects SyncToy 2.0 and according to an employee, Microsoft has identified the problem and is working to provide a fix as of 12 March 2009.[3]
