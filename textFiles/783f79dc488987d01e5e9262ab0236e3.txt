From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Within systems engineering, quality attributes are non-functional requirements used to evaluate the performance of a system. These are sometimes named "ilities" after the suffix many of the words share. Notable quality attributes include:


accessibility
accountability
accuracy
adaptability
administrability
affordability
agility
auditability
availability
credibility
standards compliance
process capabilities
compatibility
composability
configurability
Correctness
customizability
degradability
demonstrability
dependability
deployability
distributability
durability
evolvability
extensibility
fidelity
flexibility
installability
Integrity
interchangeability
interoperability
learnability
maintainability
manageability
mobility




modularity
nomadicity
operability
portability
precision
predictability
recoverability
relevance
reliability
repeatability
reproducibility
responsiveness
reusability
robustness
safety
scalability
seamlessness
serviceability (a.k.a. supportability)
securability
simplicity
stability
survivability
sustainability
tailorability
testability
timeliness
understandability
usability



Many of these quality attributes can also be applied to data quality.

[edit] Common subsets

A subset of them (Reliability, Availability, Serviceability, Usability, and Installability) are together referred to as RASUI.
Another subset used for Software Requirements (Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability) are together referred to as FURPS.
For databases RASR is an important concept (Reliability, Availability, Scalability, and Recoverability).
When dealing with safety-critical systems, the acronym RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety) is frequently used.
For interoperable software a common subset is (Portability, Operability, Openness and Predictability), sometimes referred to as POOP.
