Trabant




Manufacturer
VEB Sachsenring


Production
1957–1991


Body style(s)
2-door sedan (Limousine, Saloon)
2-door station wagon (Universal) There was also an army version


The Trabant is an automobile produced by former East German auto maker VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau in Zwickau, Sachsen. It was the most common vehicle in East Germany, and was also exported to countries both inside and outside the communist bloc. The main selling points were that it had room for four adults and luggage, and was compact, light and durable. Despite its poor performance and smoky two-stroke engine, the car has come to be regarded with affection as a symbol of the more positive sides of former East Germany and of the fall of communism (in former West Germany, as many East Germans streamed into West Berlin and West Germany in their Trabants after the opening of the Berlin Wall in 1989). For advocates of capitalism it is often cited as an example of the disadvantages of centralized planning[citation needed]. It was in production without any significant change for nearly 30 years.

[edit] Overview




A Trabant 601 Limousine.


The name Trabant means "fellow traveler" (Satellite) in Latin; the name was inspired by Soviet Sputnik. The cars are often referred to as the Trabbi or Trabi, pronounced with a short a.
Since it could take years for a Trabant to be delivered from the time it was ordered, people who finally got one were very careful with it and usually became skillful in maintaining and repairing it. The lifespan of an average Trabant was 28 years.[1] Used Trabants would often fetch a higher price than new ones, as the former were available immediately, while the latter had the aforementioned waiting period of mostly at least ten years.
There were two principal variants of the Trabant, the Trabant 500, also known as the Trabant P 50, produced 1957-1963; and the Trabant 601 (or Trabant P 60 series), produced from 1963 to 1989. (The Trabant 601 ended its production in 1991, after the introduction of a 1.1L VW engine in 1990 (see below)). The engine for both the Trabant 500 and 601 was a small two-stroke engine with two cylinders, giving the vehicle modest performance. At the end of production in 1989 it delivered 19 kW (26 horsepower) from a 600 cc displacement. The car took 21 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) and the top speed was 112 km/h (70 mph). There were two main problems with the engine: the smoky exhaust and the pollution it produced—nine times the amount of hydrocarbons and five times the carbon monoxides of the average European car of 2007. The fuel consumption was a modest 7 liters/100 km.[2] (34 mpg (US), 40 mpg (Imperial)).
The Trabant was a steel monocoque design with roof, bootlid, bonnet, fenders and doors in Duroplast, a form of plastic containing resin strengthened by wool or cotton. This helped the GDR to avoid expensive steel imports, but in theory did not provide much crash protection, although in crash tests it allegedly performed superior to some contemporary Western hatchbacks.[3][4] The Trabant was the second car to use Duroplast, after the "pre-Trabant" P70 (Zwickau) model (1954–1959). The duroplast was made of recycled material, cotton waste from Russia and phenol resins from the East German dye industry, making the Trabant the first car with a body made of recycled material.[1] 3.096.099 Trabants were made.[5]

Originally planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle, the decision to build a four-wheeled car came late in the planning process.[6] The name Trabant, Latin for "traveler" or "companion", was chosen in an internal contest in 1957, the year of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. Previous motorcycle production at Sachsenring had been under the aegis of AWZ (Auto-Werke Zwickau).
The Trabant was a relatively advanced car when it was launched in 1958; with front wheel drive, a unitary construction, composite bodywork and independent suspension all around. The main letdown was the engine: by the late 1950s small cars in western countries mainly used cleaner and more efficient four-stroke engines, as employed in the Volkswagen, whereas the Zwickauans were budgetarily forced to use two-strokes. When released the Trabant was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, which had an air cooled two cylinder four-stroke engine in the same size vehicle.
The Trabant's air cooled two cylinder 500cc (later 600cc) two-stroke engine was derived from a pre-war DKW design, with minor alterations being made throughout the car's production run. Wartburg, a GDR manufacturer of larger saloons, also used a DKW engine: a watercooled 3 cylinder 1000cc two-stroke unit, also found in earlier Saab cars.
In 1958 production began of the original Trabant, the P50. This car was the base of the Trabant series, and even the latest 1.1's had a large number of interchangeable parts with this car. The 500cc 18hp P50 evolved into a 20hp version in 1960, gaining a fully synchronized gearbox amongst other things, and finally got a 23hp 600cc engine in 1962, becoming the P60. The updated P601 was introduced in 1964. This car was essentially a facelift of the P60, with a different front fascia, bonnet, roof and rear, whilst retaining the original P50 underpinnings. This model stayed practically unchanged up to its production end, with the most major changes being 12v electrics, coil springs for the rear and a different dash for the latest models.
In 1989 a licensed version of the Volkswagen Polo engine replaced the elderly two-stroke engine, the result of a trade agreement between the two German states. The model, known as the Trabant 1,1 also had minor improvements to the brake and signal lights, a revised grille and replaced the leaf spring-suspended chassis with one using MacPherson struts. However, by the time it entered production in May 1990, German reunification had already been agreed to. The inefficient, labor-intensive production line was kept open only because of government subsidies. Demand plummeted, as residents of the east preferred second-hand western cars. The production line closed in 1991.
The Trabant's designers expected production to extend to 1967 at the latest, and East German designers and engineers created a series of more sophisticated prototypes through the years that were intended to replace the Trabi; several of these can be seen at the Dresden Transport Museum. However, each proposal for a new model was rejected by the GDR leadership for reasons of cost. As a result, the Trabant remained in production largely unchanged; in contrast, the Czechoslovak Škoda automobiles were continually updated and exported successfully. The Trabant's production method, which was extremely labor-intensive, remained unchanged.
Although Trabants had been exported from East Germany, they became well-known in the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall when many were abandoned by their Eastern owners after migrating westward. News reports inaccurately described them as having cardboard bodies. This is likely due to the fact that the body of the Trabant was Duroplast, a material that, in East German production, often made use of varying quantities of different fibers, such as cotton, or occasionally paper.
In the early 1990s it was possible to buy a Trabant for as little as a few marks, and many were given away. Later, as they became collectors' items, prices recovered, but they remain very cheap cars. Green Trabants are especially popular as they are said to bring good luck.
In the late 1990s, there were plans to put the Trabant back into production in Uzbekistan as the Olimp.[7] However, only a single model was produced.[8]
In 1997, the Trabant was celebrated for passing the "Elchtest" ("moose test"), a 60 km/h (37 mph) swerve manoeuvre slalom, without toppling over like the Mercedes-Benz A-Class infamously did. A newspaper from Thuringia had a headline saying "Come and get us, moose! Trabi passes A-Class killer test".[9]
In 2007 Herpa, a miniature vehicles manufacturer in Bavaria, showed a scale model of the "New Trabi" and revealed that they planned to introduce it. They bought the rights to the name and plan to produce a series of 5,000 cars. It would likely have a BMW engine and be sold for around €50,000.[10][11]
In 2007 the Trabant was brought into the world of Diplomacy. Steven Fisher, the Deputy Head of Mission in the British Embassy of Budapest uses it as his diplomatic car for work.[12]

[edit] Trabants in popular culture




The Painted Trabants used by U2 on their Zoo TV Tour hanging in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.


The Trabant appears in several films, sometimes in feature roles. Shortly after the German reunification, a comedy feature film named Go Trabi Go was released in Germany, chronicling the journey of an East German family across Europe in a Trabant. Although the film highlights the performance gap between the Trabant and newer models, it was a film laced with admiration of the car.[13] It was later followed by a sequel, this time about bringing the Trabi to the United States. A bright blue Trabi features in Good Bye Lenin!, the award-winning German film made in 2003 about the fall of the wall. The 1991 film Driving Me Crazy centers around the invention and subsequent theft of a Trabant modified to run on turnips rather than gasoline. The American movie Spy Game (2001) features a car chase involving a Trabant being driven by the spy Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), who is trying to smuggle an East German from East Berlin over to West Berlin. In the 1996 Czech film Kolja, the protagonist is ecstatic at finally getting a Trabant.
In their song "Blue Trabant", the Serbian rock group Atheist Rap sings about their Trabant which is in the end eaten by pigs. That song inspired a scene in the film Black Cat, White Cat. Trabant is also mentioned in their other song, "Wartburg limuzina". The rock group U2 used Trabants as props on their Zoo TV Tour, including several vehicles suspended from the ceilings of concert halls. These cars can now be seen suspended from the ceiling at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. A Trabant also appears on the cover of their album Achtung Baby, and in the music video for "One". The name of the Czech band Traband is an obvious pun, also name of Icelandic electro-rock band Trabant, just like the Polish rock band Los Trabantos.
The Trabant appears in several video games such as Half-Life 2 (where it is made out of metal instead of Duroplast), Interstate '82 (as a secret car called the Stein PappKarton), Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare in the "All Ghillied Up" mission near the first watch tower, and in the 2001 remake of Spy Hunter.
In the Mr. Plow episode of the American TV show The Simpsons, Homer attempts to buy a used car at "Crazy Vlad's Used Car Lot." In the next scene, Homer is seen crammed into a extremely small two door green car resembling a Trabant. A view of the column shifter is then seen, with Russian letters on the key. When Homer asks what country the car is from, Vlad responds "It does not exist anymore, but after a test drive, you to will find..." then he speaks a slogan in Russian. When Vlad then push starts the car, he yells "put it in H!" The emblem on the hood resembles a House Fly.
