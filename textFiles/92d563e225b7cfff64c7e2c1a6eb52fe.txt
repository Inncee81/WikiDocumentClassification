From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The phrase metasyntactic variable (pronounced /ˌmɛtəsɪnˈtæktɪk ˈvɛəriəbl/) is a neologism that is used in some programmer communities to describe a placeholder name or an alias term commonly used to denote the subject matter under discussion or an arbitrary member of a class of things under discussion. The term originates from computer programming and other technical contexts, and is commonly used in examples by hackers and programmers. The use of a metasyntactic variable is helpful in freeing a programmer from creating a logically named variable, although the invented term may also become sufficiently popular and enter the language as a neologism. The word foo is the principal example.[1]
Any word can be used as a metasyntactic variable, but "nonsense words" are commonly used. The same concept is employed in other fields where it is expressed by terms such as schematic variable (see logical form).

[edit] Explanation of the concept

[edit] Dissecting the phrase

'Meta' means providing information about, or transcending.
'Syntax' means the grammatical arrangement of words or the grammatical rules of a programming language.
'Variable' means something that can assume a value, or something likely to vary.

So we have a word that

transcends grammar and can assume a value

or one that

is more comprehensive than grammatical arrangement and is likely to vary.


[edit] Mathematical analogy

A metasyntactic variable is a word that is a variable for other words, just as in algebra letters are used as variables for numbers.[1]


[edit] Words commonly used as metasyntactic variables
A "standard list of metasyntactic variables used in syntax examples" is: foo, bar, baz, qux, quux, corge, grault, garply, waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud.[1] The word foo occurs in over 330 RFCs and bar occurs in over 290.[2]
Foo is used in one section of a tutorial on the C programming language by Brian W. Kernighan. Here, he illustrates the use of the extern declaration:[3]

Second, at the beginning of any file
that contains functions needing a variable whose definition is in some other file,
put in an extern declaration, outside of any function:

       extern  int     foo;

       f1( ) { ... }
          etc.

Spam, ham, and eggs are the principal metasyntactic variables used in the Python programming language.[4] This is a reference to the famous comedy sketch, Spam, by Monty Python, the namesake of the language.[5] In this extract from the Python tutorial showing the use of comments,[6] STRING is a metasyntactic variable.

Some examples:

# this is the first comment
SPAM = 1                 # and this is the second comment
                         # ... and now a third!
STRING = "# This is not a comment."

Wibble, wobble, wubble and flob are often used in the UK[7].
