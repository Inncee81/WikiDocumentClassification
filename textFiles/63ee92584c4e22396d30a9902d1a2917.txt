Anne of Green Gables is a bestselling novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery published in 1908. It was written as fiction for readers of all ages, but in recent decades has been considered a children's book. Montgomery found her inspiration for the book on an old piece of paper that she had written at a young age, describing a couple that were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of a boy, yet decided to keep her. Montgomery also drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, clipped from an American magazine and pasted on the wall above her writing desk, as the model for Anne Shirley, the book's main character.
Since publication, Anne of Green Gables has sold more than 50 million books.[1] In addition, this widely loved book is taught to students around the world.

[edit] Plot summary
Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, unmarried middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in the town of Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia as a helper on their farm. Through a series of mishaps, the person who ends up under their roof is a precocious girl of eleven named Anne Shirley. Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her pale countenance dotted with freckles, and with her long braids of red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly, thriving in the environment of Prince Edward Island. She is something of a chatterbox, and drives the prim, duty-driven Marilla to distraction, although shy Matthew falls for her immediately.
The rest of the book recounts her continued education at school, where she excels in studies very quickly, her budding literary ambitions and her friendships with people such as Diana Barry (her best friend, "bosom friend" as Anne fondly calls her), Jane Andrews, Ruby Gillis, and her rivalry with Gilbert Blythe, who teases her about her red hair and for that acquires her hatred, although he apologizes many times. Anne and Gilbert compete in class and Anne one day realizes she no longer hates Gilbert, but will not admit it.
The book also follows her misadventures in quiet, old-fashioned Avonlea. These adventures include her games with her friendship group (Diana, Jane and Ruby), her rivalries with the Pye sisters (Gertie and Josie) and her domestic mistakes such as dyeing her hair green. Anne, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane and several other students, eventually goes to the Queen's Academy and obtains a teaching license in one year, in addition to winning the Avery Prize in English, which allows her to pursue a B.A. at Redmond College.
The book ends with Matthew's death, caused by a heart attack after learning of the loss of all his and Marilla's money. Anne shows her devotion to Marilla and Green Gables by giving up the Avery Prize, deciding to stay at home and help Marilla, whose eyesight is diminishing, and teaching at the Carmody school, the nearest school available. To show his friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position in the Avonlea School to work at White Sands School instead, thus enabling Anne to teach at the Avonlea School and stay at Green Gables all through the week. After this kind act, Anne and Gilbert become best friends.

[edit] Characters
Anne Shirley - An imaginative, red-headed orphan who comes to live with Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, middle-aged sister and brother.
Marilla Cuthbert - A crisp, practical, no-nonsense woman who doesn't approve of Anne's wild imagination although she really does love the orphan.
Matthew Cuthbert - Marilla's brother, a shy, awkward man who takes a liking to Anne from the start. The two become friends fast.
Diana Barry - A bosom friend of Anne, Anne's kindred spirit, Anne and Diana become best friends from the moment they meet.
Gilbert Blythe - Anne's enemy from the beginning for pulling her hair and calling her "Carrots". Anne forgives Gilbert by the end of the book and the two become friends - and eventually man and wife.
Rachel Lynde - A neighbor of Matthew and Marilla and the nosiest person in town. Although she did not take a liking to Anne in the beginning she soon warms up to the freckled faced orphan.
Miss Stacy - Anne's new teacher. Miss Stacy is truly a kindred spirit to Anne. Miss Stacy worked hard to be accepted by Avonlea, as her teaching methods were new, and she was a "woman teacher."
Josie Pye - Anne's sometimes friend, sometimes rival, and classmate, a girl who is vain and generally disliked by the girls of Avonlea. Her younger sister is Gertie Pye.
Jane Andrews - One of Anne's friends whom she loves greatly, although Diana remains her closest friend. Jane is rather staid, and has little imagination.
Ruby Gillis - Another one of Anne's friends. Ruby is vain and flirtatious, always making the other girls jealous. Ruby loves getting the attention of the boys.
Reverend and Mrs. Allen - The minister and his wife, two fast friends for Anne.
Mr. Philips - Anne's first teacher, whom she despised.

[edit] Sequels
Montgomery continued the story of Anne Shirley in a series of sequels, and they are listed in the order of Anne's age in each of the novels.

[edit] Tourism




The Green Gables farmhouse located in Cavendish

The Green Gables farmhouse from which Montgomery drew her inspiration is located in Cavendish, Prince Edward Island. Many tourist attractions on Prince Edward Island have been developed based on Anne, and provincial license plates once bore her image.
Balsam Hollow and the forest that inspired the Haunted Woods described in the book are also located in the vicinity.[2] Each summer, the musicals Anne of Green Gables and Anne & Gilbert are performed at theatres in Prince Edward Island.
The popularity of Anne has extended into many countries and Anne of Green Gables has been translated into 36 languages.[3][4] Tourism by Anne fans is an important part of the Island economy.[5] The novel is very popular in Japan, [6][7] where it has been on the school curriculum since 1952 and Anne is revered as "an icon."[8] Many Japanese couples have wedding ceremonies on the grounds of the Green Gables farm and some girls arrive with red-dyed hair and pigtails, to look like Anne.[9]
Bala's Museum With Memories Of Lucy Maud Montgomery located in Bala, Ontario, Canada, is dedicated to Montgomery information and heritage, located in the former home of Fanny Pike where Montgomery and her family stayed for a vacation in 1922. She based her novel The Blue Castle on the region, changing the town's name to Deerwood, the only book she wrote not to be set in Atlantic Canada.

The Confederation Centre of the Arts' annual "Charlottetown Festival" headlines Canada's longest-running mainstage musical production Anne of Green Gables - The Musical. This show having run every summer since the Centre opened in 1964 has played to over 2 million viewers. Anne of Green Gables - The Musical was composed by Canadian theatrical legends Don Harron and Norman Campbell, with lyrics by Elaine Campbell and Mavor Moore. The production has played to Queen Elizabeth II and has also toured across Canada, the United States, Europe. Festival Artistic Director Walter Learning directed and organized a massively successful national tour of Japan in 1991. The musical also had a run in London's West End in 1969.
The Harbourfront Jubilee Theatre in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, hosts Anne and Gilbert, The Musical. Written by Nancy White, Bob Johnston and Jeff Hochhauser, the production is based on Montgomery's sequel novels to Anne of Green Gables.

[edit] Parodies
As one of the most famous characters in Canadian literature, Anne of Green Gables has been parodied by several Canadian comedy troupes, including CODCO (Anne of Green Gut) and The Frantics (Fran of the Fundy). Megan Follows also appeared on Made in Canada as Mandy Forward, the star of Pyramid Prodigy Productions' Adele of Beaver Creek series who discovered that the company was secretly producing an Adele of Beaver Creek porn knockoff.
In response to massive funding cuts to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during the later tenure of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the Vancouver-based political satire duo Double Exposure noted the effects of the budget cuts on CBC Television productions were so severe that several prominent fictional Canadian characters were being sent out to raise funds independently. There followed the sound of a doorbell, and the words: "([ding-dong]) Anne of Avon calling!"
