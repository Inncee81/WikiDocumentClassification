[edit] Biography
Karl Pilkington grew up in Manchester, and spent much of his childhood in Porthmadog, Wales due to his father's work.[4] He was also educated in Manchester, but had neither the punctuality or the motivation to learn. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant contacted Karl's school after a conversation during their XFM show [5] and discovered that he attained only one GCSE for History, for which he achieved an "E" grade.[6] Pilkington was surprised and upset at this as he remembered sitting several other GCSE exams - including English, Maths, Physics and Art, where he recalled making a "little clay man with his arms in a car" - however, he appeared not to know that registration is required for the school to pay for the exams and for it to be marked, and that you cannot just "turn up on the day", which may explain the lack of other grades. His reason for not registering was that he "never got a letter or anything telling him". (which after the exam results prompted Gervais to have a new segment called "Re-Education of Karl" in which he gave Pilkington some small historical books on Che Guevara, Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, and Rasputin) [7]
Despite his absence, Pilkington has been remembered by a schoolmate on Friends Reunited as bringing to school his pet magpie "Maggie" to show his friends, before it unexpectedly flew away; a story confirmed by Pilkington during the show in which this story was revealed.
According to Pilkington, his first name was chosen as a result of his mother dreaming when she had pneumonia and being assured of her survival by a doctor whose name-tag read "Karl".[8]
Pilkington has been through a number of jobs, his favourite being his paper round, which he had at age 14.[9]
In December 2005, Pilkington stood in for two BBC 6Music shows for Nemone, and co-presented the shows with Russell Brand. They proved so popular that by the following April Brand was working as a permanent DJ at BBC 6Music, which was the forerunner to his Radio 2 show.
It is often mused by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, that Karl "has a head shaped like a fucking orange." This phrase has become well known by the British public, and possibly worldwide, as this phrase was shouted at Stephen Merchant by a British tourist in a Vietnamese airport.[10]
Pilkington is a supporter of Manchester United.[11]
Pilkington lives in London and Kent and is known as something of a social recluse; he is rarely seen in public, even by his closest friends.
Pilkington has voiced his opinion on many occasions about doppelgängers. He is quoted as once saying "How would I know which one I was"

[edit] Persona
On 24 April 2006, The New York Times ran an article about Ricky Gervais and the podcast which described Pilkington's behaviour as a well executed "deadpan comedian" routine which "crosses Ali G and Steven Wright".[12]
Merchant and Gervais themselves have repeatedly denied claims that Pilkington's comic persona is their creation. In an on-air response to similar claims made by Chris Campling during a broadcast on Xfm, Merchant stated that he would be "ashamed" if the radio show were scripted, adding that "If we came up with a character as good as Karl, we would never squander him on a poxy little radio station like this one".[13] Gervais concurred, pointing out that writing half-hour episodes of shows such as The Office and Extras took the two up to a year, thus making the writing of weekly two-hour radio shows extremely unlikely.

[edit] Celebrity




Graffiti in Augusta, Georgia, of Karl Pilkington and his famous soundbite "I could eat a knob at night".


As a result of the success of The Ricky Gervais Show podcasts in particular, Pilkington has become a cult celebrity. Pilkington has often been mentioned in interviews given by Gervais, and he is often on the receiving end of Gervais's practical jokes. When asked who was the funniest person he knew, Gervais said that Karl Pilkington was "the funniest man alive in Britain today."[14] In addition, Pilkington appears in a twenty minute interview on Ricky Gervais's live stand-up comedy DVD, Politics. He was also invited to be an extra on the final episode of Gervais' and Merchant's Extras.
Pilkington reached new heights of fame by commenting that he could "Eat a knob at night" during a discussion on the podcast The Ricky Gervais Show when a conversation about how contestants on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! had to eat a kangaroo's penis.[15] Pilkington stated that, whilst in the morning he would be unable to face the appendage due to having a weak stomach, he would more than likely be able to eat it in the evening, 'when he had some rice or something on his stomach to bulk it up'. His phrase "I could eat a knob at night" has since spawned dance music remixes, T-shirts and other merchandise, as well as discussion on many websites. A newspaper commenting on this issue described Pilkington as a "phenomenon" who had made "Internet history".[16]
Pilkington also found work independently of Gervais and Merchant on a number of projects. He appeared as a guest on the Nation 277 series Flipside TV, been featured several times as a guest on BBC series The Culture Show,[17] was in several short films as part of the Channel 4 initiative "3 Minute Wonders", and Channel 4's "Karl Pilkington - Satisfied Fool" was broadcast 22 October 2007. The executive producer was Henry Normal, the co-owner of Baby Cow Productions[18]. Pilkington has also done voiceover work for such clients as Vodafone, HMV, Sony PSP, W H Smith and Unilever. [19]
