The Project Triangle in engineering is a triangle model of project. It is a graphic aid where the three attributes show on the corners of the triangle to show opposition. It is useful to help with intentionally choosing project biases, or analyzing the goals of your project.[1] This graphic can be confused with the project management triangle.

[edit] Overview
As a project management graphic aid, a triangle can show time, resources, and technical objective as the sides of a triangle, instead of the corners.[2] John Storck, a former instructor of the American Management Association's "Basic Project Management" course, used a pair of triangles called triangle outer and triangle inner to represent the concept that the intent of a project is to complete on or before the allowed time, on or under budget, and to meet or exceed the required scope. The distance between the inner and outer triangles illustrated the hedge or contingency for each of the three elements. Bias could be shown by the distance. His example of a project with a strong time bias was the Alaska pipeline which essentially had to be done on time no matter the cost. After years of development, oil flowed out the end of the pipe within four minutes of schedule. In this illustration, the time side of triangle inner was effectively on top of the triangle outer line. This was true of the technical objective line also. The cost line of triangle inner, however, was outside since the project ran significantly over budget.
James P. Lewis [3] suggests that project scope represents the area of the triangle, and can be chosen as a variable to achieve project success. He calls this relationship PCTS (Performance, Cost, Time, Scope), and suggests that you can pick any three.

[edit] Example




The project triangle.


You are given the options of Fast, Good and Cheap, and told to pick any two. Here Fast refers to the time required to deliver the product, Good is the quality of the final product, and Cheap refers to the total cost of designing and building the product. This triangle reflects the fact that the three properties of a project are interrelated, and it is not possible to optimise all three – one will always suffer. In other words you have three options:

Design something quickly and to a high standard, but then it will not be cheap.
Design something quickly and cheaply, but it will not be of high quality.
Design something with high quality and cheaply, but it will take a long time.

This constraint may apply to creative human activity, such as software, movies, books etc where quality is subjective. This is a false dichotomy when comparing technologies such as digital to analog in media formats.[citation needed]
There are also numerous spinoffs to this triangle, the most common including:

College: Work, Sleep, or Play – Pick two.
Girls: Single, Sane, Sexy and Smart– Pick any three. (also called The four S's of dating)
Men: Handsome, High-Earner, Faithful – Pick two.
Seventh generation consoles : Cheap, good games, high-res graphics; pick two
Choose two: (A) Fast, (B) Efficient, (C) Stable, (D) Windows (counts as two)
Bicycle Parts: Strong, Light, Cheap - Pick any two.
Opensource Software Development[4]: Speed/Time, Inclusiveness/Openness, Quality

Schedule, scope, resources and time software quality triangular pyramid – pick all four.

[edit] Project Management Triangle




The Project Management Triangle


Like any human undertaking, projects need to be performed and delivered under certain constraints. Traditionally, these constraints have been listed as "scope," "time," and "cost".[5] These are also referred to as the "Project Management Triangle," where each side represents a constraint. One side of the triangle cannot be changed without affecting the others. A further refinement of the constraints separates product "quality" or "performance" from scope, and turns quality into a fourth constraint.
The time constraint refers to the amount of time available to complete a project. The cost constraint refers to the budgeted amount available for the project. The scope constraint refers to what must be done to produce the project's end result. These three constraints are often competing constraints: increased scope typically means increased time and increased cost, a tight time constraint could mean increased costs and reduced scope, and a tight budget could mean increased time and reduced scope.
The discipline of Project Management is about providing the tools and techniques that enable the project team (not just the project manager) to organize their work to meet these constraints.
