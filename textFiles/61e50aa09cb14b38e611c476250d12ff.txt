CinePaint is an open source computer program for painting and retouching bitmap frames of movie film. It is a fork of version 1.0.4 of the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). It is likely the most successful open source tool in feature motion picture work today.[2] It is free software under the GNU General Public License.
Under its former name Film Gimp, CinePaint was used for films such as Scooby-Doo, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, The Last Samurai and Stuart Little.
Features that set CinePaint apart from its photo-editing predecessor include the frame manager, onion skinning, and the ability to work with 16-bit and floating point pixels for high dynamic range imaging (HDR). CinePaint supports a 16-bit color managed workflow for photographers and printers, including CIE*Lab and CMYK editing. It supports the Cineon, DPX, and OpenEXR image file formats. HDR creation from bracketed exposures is easy.
CinePaint is available for Linux, BSD, UNIX-like OSes, Mac OS X, and SGI IRIX.
Glasgow, a completely new code architecture being used for CinePaint, is expected to make a new Windows version possible and is currently under production. The Glasgow effort is FLTK based.[3]
