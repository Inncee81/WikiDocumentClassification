Aircrack-ng is a network software suite consisting of a detector, packet sniffer, WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK cracker and analysis tool for 802.11 wireless LANs. It works with any wireless card whose driver supports raw monitoring mode (for a list, visit the website of the project or [1]) and can sniff 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g traffic. The program runs under Linux and Windows; the Linux version has been ported to the Zaurus and Maemo platforms, and a proof-of-concept port has been made to the iPhone.
In April 2007 a team at the Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany developed a new attack method based on a paper released on the RC4 cypher by Adi Shamir. This new attack, named 'PTW', decreases the number of initialization vectors or IVs needed to decrypt a WEP key and has been included in the aircrack-ng suite since the 0.9 release.
Aircrack-ng is a fork of the original Aircrack project.

[edit] iPhone/iPod Touch
It is possible to install aircrack-ng on to an iPhone[citation needed]. However, this is not all that impressive or useful since the aircrack-ng program merely takes a file full of sniffed packets and uses the information to crack wep keys[citation needed]. So far there have been no reports of the ability to inject packets from the iPhone even put the iPhone's WiFi card into monitor mode in order to capture packets[citation needed].
