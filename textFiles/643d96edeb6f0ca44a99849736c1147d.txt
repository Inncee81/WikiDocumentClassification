[edit] Architecture
Graphviz consists of a graph description language named the DOT language[1] and a set of tools that can generate and/or process DOT files:

dot 
a command-line tool to lay out directed graphs into a variety of output formats (PostScript, PDF, SVG, annotated text and so on).
neato 
for "spring model" layout (in Mac OS version called "energy minimised")
twopi 
for radial graph layouts.
circo 
for circular graph layouts.
fdp 
another layout engine for undirected graphs.
dotty 
a graphical user interface to visualize and edit graphs.
lefty 
a programmable widget that displays DOT graphs and allows the user to perform actions on them with the mouse. Lefty can therefore be used as the view in a model-view-controller GUI application that uses graphs.


[edit] Applications
