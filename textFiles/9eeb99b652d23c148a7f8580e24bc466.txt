Trinity Rescue Kit (also known as TRK) is a free Live CD Linux distribution based on Mandriva Linux, aimed specifically at offline operations for Windows and Linux systems such as rescue, repair, password resets and disk cloning. Trinity Rescue Kit is bootable from a CD, USB media or a network using PXE. Documentation for TRK exists both on the website, as well as in the console by using the command "trkhelp -l -t". Trinity Rescue Kit omits the standard Linux manual command in order to conserve space. In addition, there are tools to migrate TRK from an ISO image to a bootable USB device and vice versa.
Trinity Rescue Kit has a graphical startup menu based on SYSLINUX and vesamenu32 which is used to select boot options.

[edit] History
Starting in 2001, after creating a bootable DOS-based CD of proprietary software for offline operations (named "The Vault"), Tom Kerremans decided to create a free bootable Linux CD. The purpose would be to include free tools that could help rescue a Windows installation that was being problematic. Binaries and scripts from other distributions inspired the Trinity Rescue Kit. Sources included Mandriva 2005 and the Fedora Cores 3 and 4. Regardless, the startup procedure and methods, as well as many scripts, are custom made for Trinity Rescue Kit.[1]

[edit] Features
The current version of TRK is 3.3 (Build 321) as of November 20, 2008. The next milestone will be 4.0 according to the official site. TRK is based on Linux kernel 2.6.26.
