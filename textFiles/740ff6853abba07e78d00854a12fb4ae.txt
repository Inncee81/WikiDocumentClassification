[edit] Site features

Creative Commons/Free Art License licensed music
BitTorrent and eDonkey for full album downloads
Ogg Vorbis and MP3 encoded audio files
An integrated rating and recommendation system
Tags and reviews to discover artists
Voluntary donations to artists through PayPal

There are more than 17,000 albums available for download now on Jamendo. [2]
Based in Luxembourg, Jamendo is multilingual. While the website was primarily in French at first, there are now complete, official versions in English, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish and Russian available as well (as of November 2008).
In April 2008, Jamendo launched a special interface for searching for MP3 and Ogg Vorbis torrents.[3]

[edit] Business model
According to one article on Jamendo's business model,[4] Jamendo's use of voluntary donations represents the first serious attempt for a file sharing site to provide a direct way to pay artists. In January 2007, Jamendo provided an advertising revenue sharing model for artists.[5]
While sites such as YouTube are still implementing plans to offer artists a share of their advertising revenue, Jamendo claims to let artists keep 50% of the revenue generated and almost 100% of the donations that Jamendo visitors give, go to individual artists.

[edit] Integration with media players
Jamendo has possibilities of integration within media players. Since the 0.9.6 release, Rhythmbox can browse and play all the Jamendo free (as in freedom) music library, download the albums, and make donations directly from within the application. You can also download and play albums from Jamendo using AmaroK2.[6]
