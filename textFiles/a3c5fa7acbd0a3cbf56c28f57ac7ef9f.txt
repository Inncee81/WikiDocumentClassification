Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is a science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick first published in 1968. The main plot follows Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter of androids, while the secondary plot follows John Isidore, a man of sub-normal intelligence who befriends some of the androids.
The novel set in a post-apocalyptic near future, where the Earth and its populations have been damaged greatly by Nuclear War during World War Terminus. Most types of animals are endangered or extinct due to extreme radiation poisoning from this war. To own an animal is a sign of status, but what is emphasized more is the empathic emotions humans experience towards an animal.
Deckard, the protagonist, is faced with retiring six escaped Nexus-6 model androids, the latest and most advanced model. Because of this task, the novel explores the issue of what it is to be human. Unlike humans, the androids possess no empathic sense. By introducing organic and realistically humanoid androids in this novel, Dick asks what qualities, if any, are unique to or are able to define what is human and makes readers question their own humanity.

[edit] Setting
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? occurs in 1992 [2021, in some editions], years after the radioactive fallout of World War Terminus destroyed most of Earth. The U.N. encourage emigration to off-world colonies, in hope of preserving the human race from the terminal effects of the fallout. One emigration incentive is giving each emigrant an “andy” — a servant android.
The remaining populace live in cluttered, decaying cities wherein radiation poisoning sickens them and damages their genes. All animals are endangered; owning and caring for one is a distinctively human empathic response, a civic virtue, and a social status symbol, per the animal's rarity. They are bought and sold as priced in “Sidney's Catalog” — which includes extinct species, marked “E”, and currently unavailable animals, marked in italic text and at the last price paid. People who cannot afford a real animal buy an electric animal for the sake of social status. The protagonist, Rick Deckard, owned a sheep, but it died of tetanus, and he replaced it with an electric sheep, thus maintaining his illusion of animal ownership.

[edit] Androids
Androids are used only in the Martian colonies, yet many escape to Earth, fleeing the psychological isolation and chattel slavery; although organic and indistinguishable from humans, they are considered things. Police bounty hunters, such as Rick Deckard, hunt and “retire” (kill) fugitive androids passing for human. Afterwards, the killed android's bone marrow is tested to confirm it was not a human. Because of anatomic vagus nerve differences, an android can commit suicide by holding his or her breath. Androids live some four years, because they cannot reproduce most life-function cells.
Early androids were detectable, because of their limited intelligence. As androids were improved, bounty hunters had to apply an empathy test — the Voight-Kampff — to distinguish humans from androids, by measuring blushing, involuntary eye movement, and responses to emotional questions about harming animals. Because androids are unempathic, their responses are either absent or fake — measurably slower than a human's; the simpler Boneli Test measures the reflex-arc velocity in the spinal column's upper ganglia.

[edit] Plot Summary
Rick Deckard lives in San Francisco, where he works as a bounty hunter for the city’s Police Department. He owns an electric sheep, which he has to care for as though it were real to conceal the fact that it is an artificial animal. At this time, most animals are extinct because of radioactive dust and hence, to own a real animal is rare. Also, in this society, people depend on the technology of the Mercer empathy box, and mood organ to set and feel their emotions. This technology is introduced with Deckard’s wife, Iran, who stays at home feeling depressed under the influences of this machine (Dick 4-5)[1]. (Chapter 1)
In a side plot, J. R. Isidore is considered "special" because his intelligence was deteriorated by radiation and hence, he is not permitted off Earth. He earns a living working for an artificial animal repair shop. When he is not working, he isolates himself by choosing to live alone in a abandoned apartment building where he spends his time using the empathy box, and listening to "Buster Friendly”. (Chapter 2)
At the police station, Deckard is informed that Nexus-6 androids, the most advanced and recent android version, are roaming the Earth. These androids have already killed several human and seriously injured the senior bounty hunter. Deckard is chosen to find and retire the six remaining Nexus-6 androids, which are hiding in metropolitan San Francisco. Deckard goes to the Rosen Association headquarters, manufacturers of the Nexus-6 android, located in Seattle. The purpose of this visit is to verify that the Voigt-Kampff empathy test, which distinguishes humans from androids based on their empathetic response to scenario questions, works on the latest android model. There, Deckard meets Rachael Rosen. (Chapter 3-4)
The Rosens ask Deckard to test the Voigt-Kampff test on Rachel and the results reveal that she is an android. However, the Rosens tell Deckard that Rachael is in fact a schizoid human being in an attempt for him to pursue the belief that the test is no longer effective and thus, requires the creation of a new empathy test. Without a reliable test, Deckard's job would be impossible because he would no longer be able to identify androids before retiring them. The Rosens use this information to bribe Deckard into not retiring the Nexus-6 androids by saying they will tell the world his test no longer works. Before he accepts the deal, Deckard asks one last question to Rachael and her delayed emotional response reveals that she is, in fact, an android. Therefore, the Rosens are lying and the Voigt-Kampff test is still valid. Rachael is shocked to learn she is not human, but rather, an advanced version of an android that has been implanted with artificial memories. (Chapter 5)
In the following chapter, readers are brieftly introduced to Pris Stratton. She lives in the same apartment building as Isidore. (Chapter 6)
Deckard then returns to San Francisco to further his task of retiring the remaining Nexus-6 androids. Rachael telephones Deckard to offer help because she thinks he is incapable of identifying and killing the androids, saying “without me, [...] one of them will get you before you get it.” (Dick 91)[2]. Deckard, however, dismisses Rachael’s suggestion. As the novel proceeds, he meets with W.P.O. agent Sandor Kadalyi who, in actuality, is Max Polokov, one of the Nexus-6 androids. Although Deckard is not immediately aware of this fact, he soon realizes that Polokov is an android and he shoots him. (Chapter 8)
Using his knowledge and love of opera, Deckard targets his next android victim, opera singer Luba Luft. He attempts to administer the Voigt-Kampff test. However, Luft refuses this request by calling the police and accuses Deckard of being a “sexual deviant” (Dick 105)[3]. The responding police officer, Officer Crams, says that he knows all the city bounty hunters and Deckard is not one of them. Deckard is taken by the officer to a headquarters he did not know exist and is he is accused for the murder of Kadalyi/Polokov. (Chapter 9)
At the station, Deckard is introduced to an officer, Garland (next android on his retirement list) and to Phil Resch, the headquarter's bounty hunter. Garland is not aware that he is an android, and both he and Resch believe that Deckard is actually an android because he killed Polokov. However, when a bone-marrow test proves that Kadalyi/Polokov was an android, Deckard’s name is cleared, and suspicion immediately falls on all the station’s police officers. Since Garland’s name is on Deckard’s list, he begins to doubt his own human identity. Resch asks that all the police, including Garland and himself, to take the Boneli Reflex-Arc android detection test, the station’s version of the Voigt-Kampff test. When Resch leaves to retrieve the test kit, Garland draws a laser tube. He hesitates to shoot Deckard and instead, he tells him that Resch is an android that has been implanted with false memories and it will be difficult to retire him. Upon his return, Resch shoots Garland; Deckard and Resch escape the police station to find and kill the opera singer Luft. (Chapter 10-11)
After Resch kills Luft in an art gallery elevator, Deckard administers the Voigt-Kampff test to Resch, who is anxious because he is afraid of the outcome being identified as an android. Because Resch was so eager to kill Luft, Deckard sees this as an inhuman trait which heightens his belief that Resch is an android. However, to Resch's relief, he passes the empathy test. As a result, Deckard compares himself to Resch, questioning which reaction is more of a human quality: his own empathetic response to Luft or Resch's indifference. Deckard becomes concerned about his empathy for Luft and thus, he hesitates whether or not he has the ability to continue hunting the androids. (Chapter 12)
Meanwhile, Isidore falls in love with Pris and spends time with her. During their time together, the two remaining androids, Roy and Irmgard Baty, come to her apartment. Isidore quickly realizes they are androids, but is glad to have company. When it is evident that he knows of their identity, the three androids vote on whether or not to kill Isidore or to use him as cover. Only Roy votes to kill Isidore. Despite his kindness to them, the androids are indifferent to Isidore, demonstrating the android's typical lack of emotions. (Chapter 13-15)
Deckard's boss insists he move quickly, strongly suggesting that he kill all the remaining androids in the same day, but Deckard is exhausted and resists. He connects to his empathy box to find an answer, but afterwards fights with himself in his mind about whether or not he should continue that night. He decides to continue hunting androids, but not on his own. He calls Rachael for help and after some convincing, she flies down and they meet in a hotel room in San Francisco. (Chapter 15)
Once they are together, Rachael confesses that she feels some form of empathy for Pris, another android, because they are the same make, and it seems that Deckard will be killing one of her own (Dick 189)[4]. The two bicker back and forth about whether to continue hunting that night, but then Rachael expresses that she loves Deckard. As a result, they postpone hunting androids for the night. (Chapter 16)
Afterwards, in the hovercar, Rachael admits to Deckard that she had seduced nine other bounty hunters in the past to prevent them from hunting androids. Among them was Resch, who was the only one capable of keeping their relationship from affecting his job. She assumes that Deckard is going to kill her because he is a bounty hunter. However, Deckard sees no reason to kill her, claiming that she only has two years left before her machinery breaks down. Rachael wins a minor victory in the sense that their relationship prevents him from killing her, but Deckard resolves to retire the remaining Nexus-6s. (Chapter 17)
In the meantime, the remaining androids continue to hide in Isidore’s apartment. When Isidore finds a spider, Pris decides to cut off its legs, one by one, to see how many are needed to walk. Isidore feels sympathetic towards the spider’s pain and drowns it. At the same time on television, Buster Friendly reveals that Mercer is a fraud and that the empathy box does not function in reality. The androids, who were expecting Friendly's announcement, confide in Isidore that Friendly is an android. Isidore refuses to believe this news. He turns to Mercer through the empathy to calm himself from this announcement as well as the spider’s torture because he refuses to believe Friendly. (Chapter 18)
Deckard reaches Isidore's building shortly after to hunt the androids, who warn Isidore in advance to send him away. Deckard meets Isidore outside his building, and while Isidore confirms that the androids are hiding in his apartment, he refuses to help Deckard any further. During the hunt, Mercer appears to Deckard in a vision and saves him from being shot in the back by Pris, who is mechanically identical to Rachael. After killing Pris, Deckard poses as Isidore. Roy and Irmgard are not capable of distinguishing between Deckard and Isidore, and this disguise enables him to retire them. (Chapter 19)
After retiring the remaining androids, Deckard returns home to learn that Rachael had gone to his house and pushed his bounty goat off the roof. To clear his mind, he takes a trip north in his hovercar to the radioactive Oregon desert. There, he decides to officially quit his job. He also finds a live toad, an animal thought to be extinct. Deckard brings the toad home to Iran, who discovers a control panel in the toad's belly, revealing that it is electric. However, Deckard is too exhausted from his numerous kills and does not seem to be troubled by the toad. While he sleeps Iran orders artificial flies for the artificial toad. (Chapter 20-22)

[edit] Analysis

[edit] Technology
In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Philip K. Dick explores a society, set in the future, that is overly dependent on advanced technology. As a result, technology has become a dominant force as it is embedded in every aspect of life. Dick examines the negative impact of technology on human beings and, throughout this novel, he questions who possesses more human-like qualities: the humans, or the androids (Calvin 341).[5]
Throughout the novel, Dick portrays humans as more machine-like than the actual machines. Scholars, such as Ritch Calvin, have picked up on this notion and argue that “Dick was frequently concerned with the ways in which technology swayed beliefs and practices” (343).[6] This statement is particularly demonstrated in the beginning when readers are introduced to the ‘mood organ’, a machine found in every home, which allows people to ‘dial’ an emotion. That is, they use this tool to set to the emotion of their choice. This exemplifies Dick’s idea that humans, in a sense, resemble machines more as they are capable to control their emotions by using an electronic device. That is, the technology of the mood organ evokes an emotional behaviour within the human as opposed to just feeling what naturally would come out of the situation: “the mood organ ‘dehumanizes’ because it separates experience and emotion, having them stand on their own instead of blurring together” (Vint 115).[7]
The primary means of distinguishing humans from androids is that the androids lack the humans’ ability to feel the emotion of empathy, as Ryan Gillis states: “the problem of telling humans and androids apart is once again complicated by authentic humans who either do not possess the ability or refuse to act empathically” (267)[8]. This is demonstrated on several occasions throughout the novel, but particularly when Deckard seeks Luba Luft to retire her. Deckard questions Luft, trying to prove that she is an android, because she is careless of what happens to other androids; however, she retaliates to this statement and accuses him of being an android because, as a bounty hunter, he kills androids as though he is emotionless (Dick 101)[9]. That is, he is not displaying any form of empathy or guilt towards retiring these machines as Luft points out and thus, in a sense, could be categorized as an android.
As Gillis states, androids are “technological constructs that are not designed to react emotionally” (267)[10]; however, some androids do not follow this criterion. That is, some androids do exhibit the empathy, although they are not meant to. For instance, Rachael displays an empathic emotional response at the thought of Pris, her identical android replica, is next on Deckard’s retirement list (Dick 189)[11]. Therefore, the defining characteristic of androids – that is, they do not feel empathy – is contrasted. Dick is purposely emphasizing that androids embody human qualities and hence, they are capable of feeling emotions (i.e. empathy). This further supports the notion that androids’ behaviour resembles that of humans, while humans –with their lack of empathy – are more like machines.
Calvin states that there is an increasing concern in the novel expressing the negative effects of technology upon society (342)[12]. In a sense, it seems as if technology is a tool that eliminates the characteristics that define humans as humans. In the novel, the capability to feel emotions, i.e. empathy, is what identifies a human apart from the androids. However, in this futuristic setting, technology has made it possible to allow humans to manipulate with their emotions, causing a separation. What is meant by separation is if these characters ‘dial’ their emotions, the experiences surrounding them do not matter as their emotion is already ‘set’ and hence, the individuals are machine-like and no longer naturally responsive. Overall, Dick is emphasizing that as society becomes increasingly dependent on technology, it will become more like the machines it relies on. It is as Calvin states: “the mechanical or technological beings serve as Dick’s primary metaphor for the loss of humanity” (344)[13].

[edit] Psychology
People cope with existential angst using a fictional device called a “Penfield Mood Organ” (reference to neurologist Wilder Penfield), to induce feeling by availing the user of a selection of moods, e.g. "awareness of the manifold possibilities of the future", the "desire to watch television, no matter what's on it"; the "pleased acknowledgement of husband's superior wisdom in all matters", and the "desire to dial" (each mood has a unique number which must be dialed in to the device). Users schedule their moods — even a depression — which contradicts the mood organ's cheerful purpose.

[edit] Religion
Mercerism is a prominent religious/philosophical movement on Earth. The movement is based on the legend of Wilbur Mercer, a man who lived before the war. Adherents of Mercerism grip the handles of an electrically powered empathy box, while viewing a monitor which displays patterns that are meaningless until the handles are gripped. After a short interval the user's senses are transported to the world of Wilbur Mercer, where they inhabit his mind in an experience shared with any other people using an empathy box at that moment.
Mercerism blends the concept of a life-death-rebirth deity with the values of unity and empathy. According to legend, Mercer had the power to revive dead animals, but local officials used radioactive cobalt to nullify the part of his brain where the ability originated. This forced Mercer into the "tomb world." He strives to reverse the decay of the tomb world and ascend back to Earth by climbing an enormous hill. His adversaries throw rocks at him along the way (inflicting actual physical injuries on the adherents "fused" with Mercer), until he reaches the top, when the cycle starts again, much like the plight of Sisyphus.
Mercer's tomb world is likely a reference to Swiss psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger and his account of Ellen West's personal experiences of anorexia nervosa in which she conceives of the material world as being like a tomb world.[14]

[edit] Entertainment
The Earth's most significant cultural icon, Buster Friendly, is a jovial talk show host whose simultaneous radio and television programs are broadcast twenty-three hours daily. Roy Baty identifies him as an android. Buster Friendly ideologically competes with Mercerism, openly attacking it in his programs.

[edit] Reception

[edit] Movie Adaptation
In 1982, Hampton Fancher and David Peoples' loose cinematic adaptation became the film Blade Runner. The international success of Blade Runner [15] helped bring Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and its author into the public eye. For that reason, after 1982 some editions of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? were branded with the title Blade Runner.

[edit] Stage version
In 2009, the book will be adapted as a stage play titled Łowca Androidów (Android Hunter, also the Polish title of the movie Blade Runner) by Polish director Grzegorz Wiśniewski. The play will premiere in June 2009 in Teatr Wybrzeże in Gdańsk[16].

[edit] Audio book
An audio book of the novel, unabridged and read by Scott Brick, was released in 2007 to coincide with the release of Blade Runner: The Final Cut. The audio book is a tie-in, using the Blade Runner: The Final Cut film poster and Blade Runner title.[17]

[edit] Sequels
Three novels intended to serve as sequels to both Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Blade Runner have been published: Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995), Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night (1996), Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon (2000). The official and authorized novels were written by Philip K. Dick's friend K. W. Jeter. They continue the story of Rick Deckard and attempt to resolve many of the differences between the novel and the film.
