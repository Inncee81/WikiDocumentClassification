[edit] Java EE 6 (2008)
Java EE 6 was first going to be developed under JSR 313 but was canceled. Java EE 6 has been developed under JSR 316 and is slated for release sometime in 2009.
The development has been plagued with controversy, although passed by 14 yes votes, 1 no vote (Apache), and 1 abstention (Borland), members aired concerns relating to the licensing terms applied by Sun Microsystems[1].
IBM's "yes" vote was caveated with:

IBM’s vote is based on the technical merits of this JSR and is not a vote on the licensing terms. IBM supports licensing models that create an open and level playing field by allowing third parties to create independent implementations of Java Specifications and that do not allow individuals or companies to exercise unnecessary control for proprietary advantage. We support open source as a licensing model for contributions in the JCP, and would hope others will support this direction. This comment is not necessarily directed at the current business or license terms for this JSR, however, it is a statement of IBM’s preferred licensing model.

Intel's was caveated with:

The Spec Lead has told us there are no “field of use restrictions” on implementations for this particular JSR. The Apache open letter about Java SE [2] claimed that a confidential license for a required JCP test suite restricts how Independent Implementations of that JCP spec can be used. Licenses to test for JCP compatibility must not be used to limit or restrict competing, compatible implementations; licenses containing such limitations do not meet the requirements of the JSPA, the agreement under which the JCP operates. For every JCP ballot, we will ask the Spec Lead whether such restrictions exist in their license.

Red Hat commented

The spec lead of the EE6 specification has confirmed that the EE6 TCK would contain no “field of use restrictions”, as originally raised by Apache with regard to another JSR (i.e. the SE TCK licensing). That is a good thing.
However, in the absence of an explicit JSPA rule that would forbid such field-of-use restrictions, we will remain worried that a similar issue might resurface anytime, for any JSR.
Consequently, in the future, for any submitted JSR (by SUNW or not), we will specifically expect the spec lead to provide clear information on that aspect and take the answer in account when casting our vote.

Apache voted NO with the following comment:

The Apache Software Foundation’s vote is based on the point of view that this spec lead - Sun - is in violation of the JSPA[2]
and therefore shouldn’t be allowed to start another JSR until the above matter is resolved.
This vote is not a comment on the technical merits of the JSR. If not for the issue of the spec lead, the ASF would have otherwise voted “yes”.
