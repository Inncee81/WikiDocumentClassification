The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, also known as the Diagram Prize, is a humorous literary award that is given to the book with the oddest title. The award was created by publisher Bruce Robertson, co-founder of the Diagram Group, an information and graphics company based in London, to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978.[1] The following year, the award was organised by Horace Bent, the diarist of British literary magazine The Bookseller.[2][3]
The Diagram Prize receives a considerable amount of press coverage every year.[4] In 2008, more people voted for the Diagram Prize (8,500 votes) than The Best of Booker Prize (7,800).[5][6] The prize is either a magnum of champagne or a bottle of claret, as well as increased publicity for both the book and its author.[7][4] The latest winner was The 2009-2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais by Philip M. Parker.[8]

[edit] Format
Nominees are selected from submissions sent in by librarians, publishers, and booksellers, although people cannot select books they publish themselves. However, since 1993, readers of The Bookseller have been allowed to nominate titles. Titles which are deliberately designed to be funny are normally rejected.[9] The winner was originally voted for by a panel of judges, but since 2000 the winner was voted for by members of the public via the Internet. Bent resisted this move and threatened to resign, but he later changed his mind and now creates the short list of finalists.[10]

[edit] Winners

[edit] Controversy
So far, there have two occassions in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991 as he felt there was no title that was odd enough to deserve the prize.[10] The prize has become noteworthy enough that in 2004, the bookseller castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, "There were too many self-consciously titled entries — presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories".[11] Bent has also express his dislike of people voting for ruder titles saying that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner, If You Want Closure in Your Relationship, Start with Your Legs.[12]
In 2009, the choice of The 2009-2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais as winner of the 2008 award was controversial as Parker did not write the book himself but used an automated authoring machine which produces thousands of titles on the basis of internet and database searches.[13] Philip Stone, charts editor and awards administrator at The Bookseller, commented by saying: "I think it's slightly controversial as it was written by a computer, but given the number of celebrity memoirs out there that are ghostwritten, I don't think it's too strange."[14]

[edit] Diagram of Diagrams
Two special anniversary awards known as the "Diagram of Diagrams" (the name reflects the "Booker of Bookers")[1] have been presented to honour both the 15th and the 30th anniversaries of the Diagram Prize. The nominations of the prizes were all of the previous winners up to that point in time. In 1993, the winner of the 15th anniversary award was Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice, the winner of the first Diagram Prize.[15][16] The second "Diagram of Diagrams", announced on 5 September 2008, was Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers, the 1996 winner.[15]
