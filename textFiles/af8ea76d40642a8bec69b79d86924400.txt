From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Mixed reality (MR) (encompassing both augmented reality and augmented virtuality) refers to the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualisations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. A mix of reality, augmented reality, augmented virtuality and virtual reality.

[edit] Applications
A topic of much research, MR has found its way into a number of applications, evident in the arts and entertainment industries. However, MR is also branching out into the business and education worlds with systems such as these:
IPCM – Interactive Product Content Management
Moving from static product catalogs to interactive 3D smart digital replicas. Solution consists of application software products with scalable license model.
SBL – Simulation Based Learning
Moving from e-learning to s-learning — state of the art in knowledge transfer for education. Simulation/VR based training, interactive experiential learning. Software and display solutions with scalable licensed curriculum development model.

[edit] Interreality Physics
In a physics context, the term "interreality system"[1] refers to a virtual reality system coupled to its real-world counterpart. A paper in the May 2007 issue of Physical Review E[2] describes an interreality system comprising a real physical pendulum coupled to a pendulum that only exists in virtual reality. This system apparently has two stable states of motion: a "Dual Reality" state in which the motion of the two pendula are uncorrelated and a "Mixed Reality" state in which the pendula exhibit stable phase-locked motion which is highly correlated. The use of the terms "mixed reality" and "interreality" in the context of physics is clearly defined but may be slightly different than in other fields.


An Example Mixed Reality: Virtual characters mixed into a live video stream of the real world. [3]



[edit] Examples

Examples of Augmented Reality with vision-based positioning system.


Free-floating holograms made by Vizoo, a mix of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. This example shows that neither just the term Virtual Reality nor Augmented Reality are applicable in this case; it is a combination.

[edit] Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino: Virtuality Continuum
In 1994 Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino defined a mixed reality as "...anywhere between the extrema of the virtuality continuum."[4] (VC), where the Virtuality Continuum extends from the completely real through to the completely virtual environment with augmented reality and augmented virtuality ranging between.




Paul Milgram's Virtuality Continuum (VC).




"The conventionally held view of a Virtual Reality (VR) environment is one in which the participant-observer is totally immersed in, and able to interact with, a completely synthetic world. Such a world may mimic the properties of some real-world environments, either existing or fictional; however, it can also exceed the bounds of physical reality by creating a world in which the physical laws ordinarily governing space, time, mechanics, material properties, etc. no longer hold. What may be overlooked in this view, however, is that the VR label is also frequently used in association with a variety of other environments, to which total immersion and complete synthesis do not necessarily pertain, but which fall somewhere along a virtuality continuum. In this paper we focus on a particular subclass of VR related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds, which we refer to generically as Mixed Reality (MR)."
