From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Spells in Harry Potter occur in the wizarding world of the series of books by author J. K. Rowling. Magic spells are used by many of the characters to achieve useful effects without the benefit of modern technology. The main depiction of a "spell" in the Harry Potter books consists of a gesture made with the character's wand, combined with a spoken or mental incantation. In the books and their associated film series, the names of the majority of these spells or the incantations used to effect them are derived from the Classical languages, particularly Latin.[1] These names are not grammatically correct in any language; most spoken phrases resemble Latin words of appropriate meaning but are not proper Latin themselves.
In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the concept of casting spells nonverbally is introduced. Earlier, every spell cast by the principal characters had been accompanied by the appropriate voiced incantation, although advanced adult practitioners of magic had cast nonverbal spells in previous books. Consequently, the incantations used for some spells introduced in Half-Blood Prince and its sequel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows are not available.
Spells are listed here by their incantations (when known), with their vernacular names in parenthesis. Some spells have no known incantation – the only reference in the text is by an informal name, either because in its only appearance in the relevant book it was cast nonverbally, or because it was never depicted in the books, only mentioned. The majority of spells cast in duels between adult characters in all seven books appear nonverbally; only their effects can identify such spells.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z




[edit] A


[edit] Accio (Summoning Charm)

Pronunciation: Various suggestions have been made, including:

['ɑkkio] (AK-ee-o) - Film and video game
['ɑksio] (AK-see-o) - Audio book
['æsio] (AH-see-o) - American audio book




Description: This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance.[2]
Seen/Mentioned: First mentioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when it was briefly used by Molly Weasley on the Weasley twins to confiscate their Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes' products from their pockets, before they left for the Quidditch World Cup. Hermione was also mentioned trying to learn this charm during her ride aboard the Hogwarts Express. Later on in the same book, Harry summons his broom to complete the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament.[GF Ch.20] Near the end of the book, Harry summons a Portkey he can't reach to escape from the Battle in the Graveyard. In "Order of the Phoenix", Bellatrix Lestrange attempts to summon the prophecy from Harry. Also seen in Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows to try to summon Horcruxes, and Harry tries to summon a falling Rubeus Hagrid. One of the Death Eaters tried to snatch Harry's Invisibility Cloak using this charm, but did not work.
Suggested Etymology: The Latin word accio means "I call" or "I summon".[3]In the Hungarian translation, the spell is called "Invito", possibly from the word "to invite".


[edit] Aguamenti (Aguamenti Charm)

Pronunciation: AH-gwa-MEN-tee (IPA: /a.gwə.'mɛn.ti/)
Description: Produces a jet of water from the caster's wand.
Seen/Mentioned: First seen in "Goblet of Fire", when Fleur put the fire out on her skirt "with a bit of water from her wand." First named in Half-Blood Prince, when Harry is being taught how to perform this specific charm in professor Flitwick's class. Later Harry casts this spell in an attempt to create water for Dumbledore to drink after taking Voldemort's potion[HBP Ch.26] and then to douse Hagrid's hut after it is set on fire later.[HBP Ch.28] Then in Deathly Hallows, Hermione Granger uses it to put out Mundungus' searing eyebrows after Harry accidentally set them on fire.[DH Ch.11] Later on, Harry uses it in a failed attempt to douse Vincent Crabbe's Fiendfyre curse in the Room of Requirement.[DH Ch.31]
Suggested Etymology: The Latin word aqua (water) combined with augmentum (compare with English augment), an increase, from augere, to increase; see aug- in Indo-European roots, meaning: “increasing the water (flow)”, this combination explains the QU/GU alteration in aqua- → agua- (see agua e. g. in Portuguese and Spanish). -menti is the genitive form of the suffix -mentum.


[edit] Alohomora

Pronunciation: ah-LOH-huh-MOR-ah (IPA: /ə'lo.həˌmo.ɹə/)
Description: Used to open and/or unlock doors,[4] but doors may be bewitched so that this spell has no effect.
Seen/Mentioned: Used throughout the series, first use by Hermione in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Later unsuccessfully cast by Ron, on the door from the room with the winged keys in Hogwarts.[PS Ch.16] Loses use gradually in the series as the characters discover more and more doors, chests etc. with counter-charms on them (e.g. The doors into Professor Snape's and Professor Umbridge's offices are mentioned as being Alohomora-proof.)
Etymology: From the West African Sidiki dialect used in geomancy meaning: Friendly to thieves as stated by J.K. Rowling in testimony during the WB and JKR vs. RDR Books[5]


[edit] Anapneo

Pronunciation: ah-NAP-nee-oh (IPA: /ə.'næp.ni.əʊ/)
Description: Clears the target's airway, if blocked.
Seen/Mentioned: Shown in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Horace Slughorn casts this spell on Marcus Belby when the latter begins to choke.[HBP Ch.7]
Suggested Etymology: The Greek word anapneo which means "to draw breath or to revive".[6]


[edit] (Anti-Cheating Spell)

Description: Cast on parchment or quills to prevent the writer from cheating while writing answers.
Seen/Mentioned: Mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as being cast on quills and exam papers for exams at Hogwarts.[PS Ch.16]


[edit] (Anti-Disapparition Jinx)

Description: Used to prevent Disapparition and/or Apparition in an area for a time. Presumably can be used to prevent an enemy from entering a defended area, or used to trap an enemy in an area.
Seen/Mentioned: Mentioned in Order of the Phoenix, used by Dumbledore to trap several Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries.[OP Ch.36] Also, cast long ago on Hogwarts, the reason why, as Hermione quotes innumerable times throughout the series, "no one can Apparate or Disapparate inside the Hogwarts grounds." In Deathly Hallows, it prevented the trio from escaping Hogsmeade when the same spell was placed around the area by Death Eaters.


[edit] (Antonin Dolohov's Curse)

Description: This curse causes serious internal injury, but does not show any external symptoms. It is described as cast with "a slashing motion", sending out a streak of purple flames. It is not non-verbal, though Harry couldn't hear it because Hermione had used the silencing charm Silencio on Dolohov before.
Seen/Mentioned: Seen only in Order of the Phoenix, this spell is cast three times by Antonin Dolohov during the battle between the Death Eaters and members of Dumbledore's Army at the Ministry of Magic.


[edit] Aparecium

Pronunciation: AH-par-EE-see-um (IPA: /æ.pə'ɹi.si.ʌm/)
Description: This spell makes invisible ink appear.
Seen/Mentioned: First seen in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, when Hermione tries to make hidden writing appear in Tom Marvolo Riddle's diary.[CS Ch.13]
Notes: See also Specialis Revelio.
Suggested Etymology: The Latin word appareo which means "to become visible or to appear".[7]


[edit] Avada Kedavra (Killing Curse)

Pronunciation: ah-VAH-dah kuh-DAHV-rah (IPA: /ə.'væ.də kə.'dæv.ɹə/)
Description: Causes a jet of green light, and a rushing noise; the curse causes instant death to the victim. It leaves no mark of death. There is no known counter-curse or blocking spell (with the exception of the curse striking another spell midflight, negating both), although the caster can be interrupted, the victim can dodge the green jet, hide behind solid objects (which burst into flame when hit by it), or, if the casting wizard is not sufficiently competent, the curse may be completely ineffective as described by Barty Crouch Jr (acting as Alastor Moody) in Goblet of Fire. Harry twice countered this spell by casting Expelliarmus. It is one of the three Unforgivable Curses; the use of this spell on another human being can earn the caster a life sentence in Azkaban.
These magical conditions have also been documented to defeat the curse, even on a direct hit:

Harry Potter was given magical protection against Lord Voldemort's use of the curse, when his mother sacrificed herself to save him.
Harry is the only person in the history of the magical world to have ever survived a direct hit of the killing curse.
Harry is saved by the twin cores effect between his wand and Voldemort's during a duel, as well as during a battle. During this battle, Harry's phoenix feather wand snaps the wand Voldemort borrowed from one of his servants, Lucius Malfoy. The reason for this is unknown. Dumbledore believes this feat to be due to the unique connections and relationships between the two duellists, which are complex and are "realms of magic hitherto unknown."
In Deathly Hallows, Harry survives two uses of the curse. The first occurs because when Voldemort tried to kill Harry as a baby, a piece of Voldemort's soul flaked off and was trapped within Harry himself (giving Harry a connection to, and many of the powers of, Voldemort). When the killing curse hit Harry in the Forbidden Forest, it killed the piece of Voldemort's soul trapped in Harry, and sent Harry to a nether region where Voldemort's use of Harry's blood gave Harry a lifeline back to the world of the living, should he choose to use it, and he decided to return to life. The second time, Harry was able to deflect the curse back at Voldemort (who died from it) because of a special condition involving the Elder Wand. This had been 'won' by Draco when he disarmed Dumbledore of his wand, but no one understood this at the time, and Draco did not use the Elder Wand. Harry had won Draco's wand in a life-or-death duel, thereby proving to the Elder Wand that Harry should be the wand's true master. Therefore, when Harry used Draco's wand to cast Expelliarmus against Voldemort's killing curse, the killing curse rebounded on Voldemort leaving Harry unharmed.




Seen/Mentioned: First said (not by name) at the beginning of the first book when Harry arrives at the Dursley's home. First seen in Goblet of Fire against Muggle Frank Bryce, and in every book following.
Suggested Etymology: During an audience interview at the Edinburgh Book Festival (15 April 2004) Rowling said: "Does anyone know where avada kedavra came from? It is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of abracadabra, which means 'let the thing be destroyed.' Originally, it was used to cure illness and the 'thing' was the illness, but I decided to make it the 'thing' as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them mine."[8]


[edit] Avis

Pronunciation: AH-vis (IPA: /a'vɪs/)
Description: This charm creates a flock of birds that pour forth from the caster's wand. When coupled with Oppugno, it can be used offensively.
Seen/Mentioned: Shown in Goblet of Fire, cast by Mr Ollivander to test Viktor Krum's wand.[GF Ch.18] In Half-blood Prince, it is cast by Hermione, followed by Oppugno which causes the birds to attack Ron Weasley.[HBP Ch.14]
Suggested Etymology: The Latin word avis which means "bird".[7]


[edit] B

[edit] (Babbling Curse)

Description: The Babbling Curse is not fully understood but it is presumed to cause a person to babble whenever they try to speak.
Seen/Mentioned: According to Gilderoy Lockhart, he once cured a Transylvanian villager of this affliction, but as he proved an untrustworthy source of information, it is possible the curse does not exist at all. However, the curse itself may exist, but it could be that someone else cured the said villager.


[edit] (Banishing Charm)

Description: Opposite to "Accio".
Seen/Mentioned: Seen in Goblet of Fire, cast by Hermione who perfectly banishes a cushion into a box which is their target in their Charms class. To Harry's great surprise, he also perfectly banishes a cushion during this lesson.


[edit] (Bat-Bogey Hex)

Description: Grotesquely enlarges the target's bogeys, gives them wings, and sets them attacking the target.
Seen/Mentioned: Ginny Weasley is depicted as an accomplished caster of this particular spell.[OP Ch.6] She is shown to use it in Order of the Phoenix on Draco Malfoy,[OP Ch.33] and in Half-Blood Prince on Zacharias Smith.[HBP Ch.7][9]


[edit] (Bedazzling Hex)

Description: Similar to a Disillusionment Charm, it can be used to conceal a person or an object. Is also used to make invisibility cloaks.
Seen/Mentioned: Mentioned in Deathly Hallows by Xenophilius Lovegood when speaking of the different methods by which Invisibility Cloaks may be created.


[edit] (Bubble-Head Charm)

Description: Puts a large bubble of air around the head of the user. Used as a magical equivalent of a breathing set.
Seen/Mentioned: in Goblet of Fire, Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour use this charm underwater in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament.[GF Ch.26] In Order of the Phoenix, it is described as used by many Hogwarts students when walking through the hallways, because of the bad smells caused by the various pranks played on Dolores Umbridge.[OP Ch.30]


[edit] C

[edit] (Caterwauling Charm)

Description: Anyone entering the perimeter of a Caterwauling Charm sets off a high-pitched shriek.
Seen/Mentioned: Mentioned in Deathly Hallows, cast by Death Eaters over Hogsmeade to protect against intruders.[DH Ch.28]
Note: Similar to an intruder charm: they both produce an alarm if the vicinity is disturbed.


[edit] Cave Inimicum

Pronunciation: KAH-vay ih-NIH-mih-kum (IPA: /ˈkæ.ve ɪ.ˈnɪ.mɪ.kʌm/)
Description: Spell used to strengthen an enclosure from enemies.
Seen/Mentioned: Shown only in Deathly Hallows, cast by Hermione and Harry Potter to strengthen their campsites' defences.[DH Ch.22]
Etymology: Correct Classical Latin for "Beware the enemy", from the verb caveo and the noun inimicus.[7]


[edit] (Cheering Charm)

Description: Causes the person upon whom the spell was cast to become happy and contented, though heavy-handedness with the spell may cause the person to break into an uncontrollable laughing fit. The spell was created by Felix Summerbee.
Seen/Mentioned: First seen in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.[PA Ch.15]


[edit] Colloportus

Pronunciation: cul-loh-POR-tus (IPA: /kɔ.lo.ˈpɔ˞.təs/)
Description: Magically locks a door, preventing it from being opened by Muggle means.[10]
Seen/Mentioned: First in Order of the Phoenix, cast by Hermione in the Department of Mysteries.
Notes: This spell functions as the counter spell to Alohomora
Suggested Etymology: The Greek word kollao, which means "to join closely together, bind closely",[11] with the Latin word porta meaning "a gate".[7]


[edit] (Colour-Change Charm)

Description: Changes an object's colour.
Seen/Mentioned: Attempted by Ron on initial trip to Hogwarts; Mentioned in Harry's Ordinary Wizarding Levels in Order of the Phoenix.[OP Ch.31]


[edit] Confringo (Blasting Curse)

Pronunciation: con-FRIN-goh (hard "g") or con-FRIN-joh (IPA: /kʌn.ˈfɹɪŋ.gəʊ/ or /kʌn.ˈfɹɪn.dʒəʊ/)
Description: Causes anything that the spell meets to explode in flames.
Seen/Mentioned: Seen only in Deathly Hallows. In the opening chapters, it is cast by Harry to destroy the sidecar of the flying motorbike.[DH Ch.4] Later, it is used by Hermione in an attempt to kill Nagini and facilitate an escape from Bathilda Bagshot's house in Godric's Hollow.[DH Ch.17]
Suggested Etymology: The Latin confringo, which means "to break in pieces, to bring to naught".[7]


[edit] Confundo (Confundus Charm)

Pronunciation: con-FUN-doh (IPA: /kʌn.ˈfʌn.dəʊ/)
Description: Causes the victim to become confused and befuddled.
Seen/Mentioned: First mentioned in Prisoner of Azkaban, when Severus Snape suggests that Harry and Hermione had been Confunded to believe Sirius Black's claim to innocence.[PA Ch.21] In Goblet of Fire, it is suggested that a powerful Confundus Charm is responsible for the Goblet choosing a fourth Triwizard contestant.[GF Ch.17] It is first seen in action when Hermione uses it on Cormac McLaggen during Quidditch tryouts in Half-Blood Prince.[HBP Ch.11] Its vernacular name is first revealed when Harry uses it on security guards during the Gringotts break-in in Deathly Hallows.[DH Ch.26]
Suggested Etymology: The Latin word confundo, which means "to confuse, throw into disorder".[7]


[edit] (Conjunctivitus Curse)

Description: A curse that causes great pain to the victim's eyes.
Seen/Mentioned: It is suggested by Sirius in Goblet of Fire as a means for defeating a dragon for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, and used by Krum for this purpose.[GF Ch.19, 20] Mentioned in Order of the Phoenix as cast by Madame Maxime against giants.[OP Ch.20]


[edit] Crucio (Cruciatus Curse)
Cruciatus redirects here. For the ligaments in the knee, see Cruciate ligament.

Pronunciation: KROO-see-oh/KROO-shee-OH (IPA: /ˈkɹu.si.əʊ/)
Description: Inflicts unbearable pain on the recipient of the curse. The effects of the curse depend upon the desires and emotions of the character - to produce the "excruciating" pain implied by the name, one must (according to Bellatrix Lestrange) desire to cause pain purely for its own sake or for fulfillment. The extreme pain inflicted by the curse when cast so - without any apparent evidence of physical harm - makes it uniquely suited as a form of torture. This pain has included the sensations of flaming bones and a head that was split open by crude methods without sedation.[HP4] One of the three Unforgivable Curses.
Seen/Mentioned: first seen in Goblet of Fire introduced by Barty Crouch Jr (acting as Moody) and used on a spider. Used regularly by the Death Eaters as torture, and by Voldemort as punishment, even against his servants. Used twice by Harry on Death Eaters, in Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows.
Suggested Etymology: Crucio (Latin) means "I torture", originating from crux (genitive crucis), which means "torture platform or stake", or more specifically, "cross". The word excruciating is descended from the same root - crucifixion was a form of torturous execution. In the novels, the verbal form of the word is 'cruciate', as when Amycus Carrow says in the final book "I'll Cruciate the lot of 'em." The caster has to believe the spell will work, as Harry realized in Deathly Hallows using it against Amycus, when he disrespected Professor McGonagall in the Ravenclaw common room.


[edit] D

[edit] Defodio (Gouging Spell)

Pronunciation: deh-FOH-dee-oh (IPA: dɛ.ˈfəʊ.di.əʊ/)
Seen/Mentioned: Cast by Harry, Ron and Hermione in Deathly Hallows to help dig their way out of the Gringotts Tunnels.[DH Ch.26]
Suggested Etymology: Latin defodio, meaning, "to dig, dig out."


[edit] Deletrius

Pronunciation: deh-LEE-tree-us (IPA: /də.'li.tɹi.əs/)
Seen/Mentioned: Seen only in Goblet of Fire when Amos Diggory gets rid of the echo of the Dark Mark from Harry's wand.[GF Ch.9]
Suggested Etymology: Latin verb delere meaning to destroy, from which the English word delete comes, meaning to remove.[12]


[edit] Densaugeo

Pronunciation: den-SAW-jee-oh /dɛn.'sɔ.dʒi.əʊ/)
Description: Causes the teeth of the recipient to grow at an alarming rate.
Seen/Mentioned: Seen only in Goblet of Fire, cast by Draco on Harry, which is then deflected onto Hermione.[GF Ch.18]
Suggested Etymology: Latin dens, meaning "tooth", and augeo, meaning "to enlarge".[13]


[edit] Deprimo

Pronunciation: DEH-prih-moh.
Seen/Mentioned: Introduced in Deathly Hallows when Hermione casts this to blast a hole in the Lovegood's living room floor.[DH Ch.21]
Suggested Etymology: Latin deprimo which means to "dig deep".[13]


[edit] Descendo

Pronunciation: deh-SEN-doh (IPA: /dɛ.ˈsɛn.dəʊ/)
Seen/Mentioned: Seen twice in Deathly Hallows, it is cast by Ron to magically cause the stairs in his room to descend,[DH Ch.6] and later by Crabbe in the Room of Requirement to lower the wall behind which Ron is hiding.[DH Ch.31]
Suggested Etymology: Latin descendo, meaning "to come down, to descend".[13]


[edit] Diffindo (Severing Charm)

Pronunciation: dif-FIN-doh (IPA: /dɪ.'fɪn.dəʊ/)
Seen/Mentioned: In Goblet of Fire when Harry urgently wants to talk to Cedric he casts this spell to rip his bag, delaying him for class, also in Order Of The Pheonix, Harry tries to cut the ropes wrapped around him but the spell fails,[GF Ch.9] and in Half-Blood Prince to switch covers of his potion books. Also shown several times in Deathly Hallows, for cutting ropes,[DH Ch.9] chains,[DH Ch.13] etc.
Suggested Etymology: Latin diffindo, "I divide."[3]


[edit] (Disillusionment Charm)

Seen/Mentioned: First in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when Dumbledore tells Harry that he does not need a cloak to become invisible. In Order of the Phoenix, Moody casts this charm on Harry.[OP Ch.3, 4] Mentioned in Half-Blood Prince on a purple leaflet from the Ministry of Magic.[HBP Ch.3] Xenophilius Lovegood mentions, in Deathly Hallows, that Invisibility Cloaks are sometimes created by casting a Disillusionment Charm on a regular cloak. Also in Deathly Hallows, Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle use the charm to hide outside the Room of Requirement.[DH Ch.21]
Notes: The described sensation of a Disillusionment Charm is a feeling "something cold and wet trickling down your back." When the charm is lifted, the subject feels something hot trickling down their back.[OP Ch.3, 4]


[edit] Dissendium

Pronunciation: dis-SEN-dee-um (IPA: /dɪ.'sɛn.di.əm/)
Description: Causes the statue of the humpbacked witch hiding the secret passage to Honeydukes, as well as other hidden passageways, to open up.[PA Ch.10]
Seen/Mentioned: Seen only in Prisoner of Azkaban.
Suggested Etymology: Latin discedo meaning "I swerve".[13]


[edit] Duro

Pronunciation: DOO-roh (IPA: })
Description: Turns its target to stone.
Seen/Mentioned: Seen in Deathly Hallows, cast by Hermione while escaping from Death Eaters in Hogwarts.[DH Ch.32]

[edit] E

[edit] Engorgio (Engorgement Charm)

Pronunciation: en-GOR-jee-oh (IPA: /ɪn.'gɔ˞.dʒi.əʊ/)
Description: Causes objects to swell in size.
Seen/Mentioned: A "Growth Charm" with the same effect is briefly mentioned. Hagrid is suspected of having performed the charm on his pumpkins in Chamber of Secrets. Next seen in the Goblet of Fire: Mentioned by Mr. Weasley as a probable charm used on Ton-Tongue Toffees which engorged Dudley's tongue when the Weasleys fetched Harry for the Quidditch World Cup; when Barty Crouch Jr, impersonating Moody, casts it on a spider to enhance a demonstration of the effects of the Cruciatus Curse; and Ron suggested it might be the cause of Hagrid's abnormal size before learning that he is half-giant. Harry in Deathly Hallows also cast it on a spider.
Suggested Etymology: English word engorge meaning "to fill to excess".[12]


[edit] (Entrail-Expelling Curse)

Description: Presumably causes the entrails (i.e. intestines) to be ejected from the body.
Seen/Mentioned: First mentioned in Order of the Phoenix when Harry visits St Mungo's following Arthur Weasley's attack by Nagini while guarding the Department of Mysteries.
Suggested Etymology: English word expel meaning "to drive or force out or away".[14]
Notes: The spell is listed under a portrait of Urquhart Rackharrow, 1612-1697, who is known for being the spell's inventor. [OP Ch.22]


[edit] Episkey

Pronunciation: eh-PIS-key (IPA: /ɛpɪ'ski/)
Description: Used to heal relatively minor injuries. When this spell is cast, the person feels their injured body part go very hot and then very cold.
Seen/Mentioned: Used in Goblet of Fire after the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. In Half-Blood Prince, Nymphadora Tonks uses this spell to fix Harry's broken nose; also used by Harry in the same book to fix Demelza Robins' mouth.
Suggested Etymology: Greek episkeu meaning "repair, restoration".[15]
Notes: Rowling writes in Half-Blood Prince that Harry's knowledge tells him this spell could belong to a family (or variety) of Healing Spells.


[edit] Erecto

Pronunciation: ee-RECK-toh or eh-RECK-toh (IPA: /ɪ.ˈɹɛk.təʊ/ or /ə.ˈɹɛk.təʊ/)
Description: Used to erect a tent or other structure.
Seen/Mentioned: Possibly used in Goblet of Fire by wizards at the campsites near the Quidditch World Cup. Used by Hermione and Harry to construct shelter for themselves and Ron in Deathly Hallows.
Suggested Etymology: Latin erectus meaning "upright, erect".[13]


[edit] Evanesco (Vanishing Spell)

Pronunciation: ev-an-ES-koh (IPA: (IPA: /ɛ.vn̩.'ɛs.kəʊ/)
Description: Makes the target vanish.
Seen/Mentioned: Used in Order of the Phoenix by Snape to make Harry's potions disappear from his cauldron. In addition, when Fred and George were showing off their puking pastilles, Lee Jordan cleared the bucket of vomit with the Evanesco spell. During their stay at #12, Grimmauld Place, Bill uses this on a stack of documents. This suggests that Vanished objects can be recovered.
Suggested Etymology: Latin evanesco meaning "to vanish".[13]
Notes: According to Minerva McGonagall, in Deathly Hallows, Vanished objects and organisms go "into non-being, which is to say, everything." This was McGonagall's response to the question, "Where do Vanished objects go?" from the doorknocker at Ravenclaw Tower.


[edit] Expecto Patronum (Patronus Charm)

Pronunciation: ex-PEK-toh pa-TROH-nuhm
Description: Conjures an incarnation of the caster's innermost positive feelings, such as joy, hope, or the desire to survive, known as a Patronus. A Patronus is conjured as a protector, and is a weapon rather than a predator of souls: Patronuses shield their conjurors from Dementors, and can even drive them away. A Patronus "cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so Dementors can't hurt it."[16] The conjured Patronus protects the witch or wizard that summoned it, obeys his or her commands, and fades away shortly after it is no longer required. When conjured, a Patronus appears silvery, ethereal, and semi-transparent. Improperly formed Patronuses range from momentary formless bursts of silvery mist, to poorly-defined forms which are easily defeated or quickly dissipate on their own. A full-fledged (or corporeal) Patronus takes on a fixed animal form that is often significant to the witch or wizard casting the charm. Patronuses summoned by a particular person have been known to change, such as Tonks' patronus. Rowling has said that Snape was the only Death Eater to be able to produce a Patronus. According to her this is 'because a Patronus is used against things that the Death Eaters generally generate, or fight alongside. They would not need Patronuses'.[17] According to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Charm is also the only known defensive spell against Lethifolds.
Seen/Mentioned: First seen in Prisoner of Azkaban when a Dementor appears in the Hogwarts Express, and Hermione says that Remus Lupin repelled the Dementor by casting a silvery object from his wand. Harry's corporeal Patronus first appears in a Quidditch game, and it is used by other characters throughout the rest of the series.
Notes: Dumbledore has devised a method of using Patronuses to deliver messages putting it into the exclusive use of the Order of the Phoenix. Members of the Order are the only wizards who know how to use their spirit guardians to send messages to one another. According to Rowling, the Patronus is "an immensely efficient messenger" as it is not hindered by physical obstructions or dark matters. Each Patronus has a special quality and appearance that is different and easy to recognise, which makes it clear which Order member has sent the message. In addition, since no one can conjure another person's Patronus, this method of communication does not carry the risk of passing fake messages.[18] It is noteworthy that in Deathly Hallows, McGonagall creates three Patronuses simultaneously to call for Professors Flitwick, Sprout, and Slughorn.
Suggested Etymology: Expecto Patronum is Latin for "I await a protector".[19] It is related to "pater" (father) and Harry's Patronus indeed takes the same form as that of his father's animagus form (a stag).


[edit] Expelliarmus (Disarming Charm)

Pronunciation: ex-pel-ee-AR-mus (IPA: /ɛks.ˌpɛ.li.'a˞.mɪs/)
Description: Produces a jet of scarlet light. This spell is used to disarm another wizard, typically by causing the victim's wand to fly out of reach.[20][21] It can also throw the target backwards when enough power is put into it. If it hits, or gets close, to another spell, if powerful enough, it will deflect the spell, causing it to hit its caster. As demonstrated in Prisoner of Azkaban, simultaneous use of this spell by multiple witches or wizards on a single person can throw the wizard back with much greater force.
Seen/Mentioned: First seen in Chamber of Secrets, when Snape disarms Gilderoy Lockhart in the Duelling Club; from then on it is commonly used throughout the rest of the series. Draco uses it to disarm Dumbledore and Harry uses the spell to not only disarm Gregory Goyle in the Room of Requirement, but also to reflect Voldemort's killing curse during the final battle. He also used it to battle Death Eaters when they were chasing him on broom across London. It is seen by the Death Eaters as Harry's signature spell, as he had used it to duel Voldemort in both Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows.
Suggested Etymology: Latin expello meaning "to expel, to thrust away" and Latin arma meaning "weapons of war".[13]

Seen/Mentioned: In Prisoner of Azkaban, it is explained that when Harry was an infant, he and his parents, James and Lily Potter, were hidden from Voldemort by this charm. Later, in Order of the Phoenix, the charm is used to hide the location of the headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix. Order members in Deathly Hallows also use it to protect their homes.
Suggested Etymology: Latin fidelis meaning "confidants".[13]
Notes: Rowling previously stated that when a Secret-Keeper dies, the Secret they held can never be revealed to anyone else; the people who were told before the Secret-Keeper's death will still know the secret, but after the death of the Secret-Keeper no one new can be brought into the circle of knowledge.[22] However, in Deathly Hallows, it is explained that upon the Keeper's death, all those who have been told the secret become Secret-Keepers in turn, and can pass the secret on to others.

Suggested Etymology: English fiend meaning "enemy"[23] and Old English fyr meaning "fire".[24]

Witches and wizards used this spell during medieval burnings. It is also said in A History of Magic that Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being "burned," so she would openly tell people that she was a witch just so she could be caught and burned; no less then forty-seven times in different names.

[edit] (Flying Charm)

Description: Causes the victim of the curse to obey the spoken/unspoken commands of the caster. The experience of being controlled by this curse is described as a complete, wonderful release from any sense of responsibility or worry over one's actions, at the price of one's free will. Resisting the effect of the curse is possible, however, and several individuals have been able to successfully overcome it, including Harry and both of the Crouches, who learn to resist the curse after being subjected to its effects for an extended period. Harry describes the feeling of being the caster as controlling a marionette through a wand (although Harry's particular experience is suspect due to his lack of commitment to casting Unforgivable Curses). One of the three Unforgivable Curses.
Seen/Mentioned: First mentioned (not by name) in the first book when Ron told Harry that Lucius Malfoy claimed himself being jinxed during the first war, thus Lucius evaded imprisonment.

Used by Harry in Deathly Hallows on a Gringotts goblin and Travers, and by the Death Eaters on Pius Thicknesse.
Suggested Etymology: Imperare is Latin for "to order, command", and is the root of several modern English words.
