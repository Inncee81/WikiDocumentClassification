Samael Aun Weor.


Samael Aun Weor (born Víctor Manuel Gómez Rodríguez) (March 6, 1917 - December 24, 1977) was a spiritual teacher, occultist, esotericist and author. He established himself in Mexico in the 1950s where he founded the 'International Gnostic Movement'. [1]In his over sixty books and hundreds of held conferences, he describes a teaching called "Gnosis", the Greek word for "knowledge", from which is derived the name "Gnosticism", designating a sectarian syncretism which appeared at the beginning of the Christian Era and was considered heresy by the Church Fathers.[2]

[edit] Life




Christ


Samael Aun Weor was born in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Republic of Colombia, son of Manuel Gómez Quijano and Francisca Rodríguez de Gómez. His childhood and family life are not well known, except that he had a brother, and his father remarried after a divorce.
In his autobiographical work The Three Mountains, Samael Aun Weor stated that because he was born with an awakened consciousness, he was analyzing his previous lives before mastering how to walk.[3][4] At the age of 17, he was asked to lecture at the local Theosophical Chapter, and a year later was admitted into the occult society Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua (F.R.A.)[3],[5][6]. While a student in the F.R.A., Aun Weor methodically studied the entire Rosicrucian library and it was here that he allegedly learned the secret of the "Great Arcanum," or White Sexual Magic; the profoundly veiled sexual key which, according to Weor, underpins all of the world's great religions.[3] According to Eliphas Levi, "...in former times, whosoever revealed, or caused the key of this supreme secret to be discovered by others through imprudent revelations, was condemned immediately to death." [7]
A period of historical obscurity ensues between the mid-1930s and 1950. Admittedly, recapitulating some of the bygone events of his former incarnations, Aun Weor became a spiritual vagabond of sorts, traveling with neither home nor income. At one point he lived with a tribe of indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Northern Colombia, learning the healing secrets which would later form the foundation of his medical treatise, Occult Medicine and Practical Magic.[8] It was also during these years that he claimed to have had his first experience of the Illuminating Void meeting his "Inner Being" or Atman whose name is "Aun Weor", meaning Word of God.
Although he was briefly married once before, in the early 1940s he met "Litelantes" (born Arnolda Garro Mora) with whom he lived for 35 years. Weor explains that when he first met her, this "Lady-Adept" Genie used to instruct him in entering the so-called Jinn state, which he claims is placing the physical body in the fourth dimension.[9] This practice in the Nahuatl Aztec religion is known as Nahuatlism.[10] In chapter three of The Perfect Matrimony, the author declares that soon Astrophysics will demonstrate the existence of hyperspace by the fourth coordinate of Hypergeometry.[11]




Philosopher's Stone


By 1948, Aun Weor began teaching to a small set of students. In 1950, under the name "Aun Weor", he managed to publish The Perfect Matrimony of Kinder, or The Door to Enter into Initiation with the aid of his close disciples.[12] The book, later entitled The Perfect Matrimony, claimed to unveil the secret of sexuality as the cornerstone of the world's great religions.[13] In it he elucidated topics such as sexual transmutation,[14] tantra, sexual magic and esoteric initiation.[15] Writing in such a candid manner regarding sex was met with disdain by the majority of the public at the time. Seen as immoral and pornographic, Aun Weor found himself fleeing angry mobs wishing to silence him by whatever means necessary. He was incarcerated numerous times, at least once for "committing the crime of healing the sick".[3][16] While in jail, however, he continued to write books. In 1953, he published Occult Medicine and Practical Magic revealing for the first time a cure for cancer. In 1977, in the revised edition of the same book, he published the statement that cancer germ cells[17] do not proliferate in the presence of catalase and copper. In 1999, a similar statement corroborated by laboratory experiment appeared in Carcinogenesis.[18] Around this time, back in the 50s, Aun Weor and his small but growing number of disciples built the Sumum Supremum Sanctuarium, an "underground temple" in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Before 1960, he had published 20 more books with topics ranging from Endocrinology and Criminology to Kundalini Yoga,[19][20] revealing publicly for the first time the key to awaken Kundalini, "the sacred serpent of our magical powers", something that has never been done before this time.[21] He founded numerous Gnostic Institutions and created Gnostic centers in Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica. A "triangle" relationship was established between the Universal Gnostic Movement founded by Samael Aun Weor, the South American Liberation Action (ALAS) in Argentina headed by Francisco A. Propato Ph.D.[22] a graduate of La Sorbonne and Spanish translator of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam,[23] and the Sivananda Aryabarta Ashram directed by Swami Sivananda in India.[24]
Nevertheless, the development of the Gnostic Movement was not without dramatic setbacks. At the time of the publishing of the revised edition of The Perfect Matrimony (1961), the movement had fallen apart. He wrote that "those who did not leave the Gnostic Movement can be counted on the fingers of one hand."[25] However by the time of his death, Samael Aun Weor had completely re-established the broad international reaches the movement previously held. In 1991, F. W. Haack (1935–1991) who was chief delegate of the Evangelical Church with responsibility for sects and ideologies attacked Weor's ideology in a German book published in Zurich but the Gnostic branches of the movement in Germany and Switzerland are still active and expanding.[26]
Into the 1960s, he continued to write many books on topics, such as Hermetic Astrology, Flying Saucers, and the Kabbalah. However, he also wrote sociopolitical works such as the Platform of POSCLA (Partido Socialista Cristiano Latinoamericano), Latin-American Christian Socialist Party, which attacks the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism and any other aspect of "Materialistic Atheism": the party's motto being "All for one and one for all" and its method, the conscious practice of Ahimsa.[27] The fundamental ideas of the Party's Platform are expounded in his book The Social Christ.[28] There Samael Aun Weor turns to The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,[29] a rather personal version of which as The International Jew was published during the Roaring Twenties by vegeterian american magnate Henry Ford in his automobile dealer gazette the Dearborn Independent, as necessary to understand the workings of the Dark Fraternity: an alleged Fraternity of Crime involved in the workings of Big Corporations. As early as 1921, Philip Graves of The Times of London exposed The Protocols as forgery.[30]
In what was to be the last decade of his life, he penned works such as Parsifal Unveiled, which details the esoteric symbolism of the Wagner opera, and Gnostic Anthropology in which he heavily criticizes the theories of Darwin, Haeckel, "and their henchmen". The books The Great Rebellion, Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology, and The Revolution of the Dialectic provide a ground work for the vast knowledge of esoteric psychology found rooted in every genuine religion. During this time, he was preparing the highest vehicle of his doctrine, The Pistis Sophia Unveiled,[31] in which he meditated, verse-by-verse, upon the extremely esoteric Gnostic text Pistis Sophia.[32]
Samael Aun Weor never actually received any income from his books. At the 1976 "Gnostic Congress", he publicly renounced all his copyrights in an effort to help the books he wrote become more widely available (although copyright was later given to his wife, Litelantes, to prevent poor translation). The desire of Samael Aun Weor was that his books would be sold cheap, so that even the poorest of person could purchase them. Mario Moreno "Cantinflas" who was the guest of honor at the 1976 Gnostic Congress in Guadalajara Mexico, in his own lifetime would give away much of his wealth to the poor.[33]
By August 1977 he had developed stomach cancer but he continued to speak to both his students and the general public, giving radio and television interviews while touring Mexico. Like Aldous Huxley's and Ramakrishna's, since disease is an expression of a fault, Karma or of one's destiny, medicine is of no use.[34] Eventually he was forced to stop, due to debilitating stomach pain, and his condition steadily worsened until his death on December 24, 1977. He was survived by his wife and children.

[edit] Master and Avatar




Kalki Avatar


Throughout his books and lectures there are many instances in which Samael Aun Weor states that he is a Master and that his inner being, Samael, is the Avatar of Aquarius. For example, in The Aquarian Message, he writes, "the Maitreya Buddha Samael is the Kalki Avatar of the New Age." The Kalki avatar and Maitreya Buddha, he claimed, are the same "White Horse Rider" of the book of Revelation.[35][36]
He also states that he completed the Great Work of Self-Realization in the previous Manvantara and had been living on Earth for millions of years, as a bodhisattva of compassion, before becoming a fallen angel. He stated that this is why Samael is synonymous with both a demonic connotation, such as "blind God," as well as an angel,[37] and it was only in his most recent incarnation that he paid his karmic debts, and became an upstanding bodhisattva once again.[38]
Although he affirmed his spiritual mastery many times, he also regularly rejected the worship of his personality:
"I do not follow anyone, nor do I want anyone to follow me. What I want is for each one of you to follow his own Inner Being. I am only a lighthouse in the sea of existence, and I do not need a clientèle in order to subsist... Masters exist in abundance, and I am only one of many; therefore, those who want to find the Masters will find them within, in the depths of their own inner consciousness."[39][40]

[edit] Doctrine of Synthesis




Yab-Yum


Samael Aun Weor states that he is delivering the Doctrine of Synthesis because it provides a clear and precise doctrine that syncretizes an extensive variety of teachings that study the human condition.[41][42] Although, he drew extensively from different sources, he always expressed the teaching in his own words and made sure to include the revelation of the Great Arcanum which those authors usually missed for it was forbidden to reveal it under penalty of death.[43] He seldom quoted an author verbatim and so gave very little credit directly to these different sources, specially Eliphas Levi, Blavatsky and Gurdjieff. In revealing the Great Arcanum, he quotes Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller[44] and gives him credit for that enigmatic sentence written in Latin, just what the doctor ordered; the doctor's prescription reads as follows: "Inmissio membri virilis in vaginam sine ejaculatio seminis".[45]
Religions are viewed as idiosyncratic expressions of immutable and eternal values. Religions are said to be born and die in time, yet their spiritual values always remain eternal. When a religious form has fulfilled its mission, it begins to degenerate and dies, then a new messenger appears and delivers a doctrine appropriate for that culture. Different cultures require different doctrines for their development and this results in a vast difference of religious doctrines. Nevertheless, if one understands their core values, all religions naturally support each other.[46][47][48]




World Religions


Weor stated many times that schools and religions can become cages of the mind which impede the reception of truth,[49] [50][51]yet he also delivered a massive doctrine and states that every religion and sect is necessary, that “all religions are pearls strung on the golden thread of divinity.”[52][53] [54]A possible resolution is found when one understands that just as a cage can protect one who is bewildered by the unknown, so can it become an obstacle for the realization of truth.[55] Ultimately the teachings call for the student to acquire his own gnosis, or self-knowledge, and the teachings are only a means to that end.[56][57] "Let each man follow his own path."[58]

[edit] Anthropology
It is not by following Darwin's scientific theory of evolution that Weor Gnostic Anthropology may be understood. It is by following the trend of thought that appears first in the Biblical story of Genesis and the fall of man, H. P. Blavatsky's Anthropogenesis, followed by Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy and the views of P. D. Ouspensky expressed in A New Model of the Universe. In other words, man today is the result of a process of degeneration which began ages ago.




Pentagram


Weor stated that today's so called "humans" have their origin from the time when the degenerated humans from the continent of "Lemuria" copulated with beasts which gave creation to the "intellectual animal".[59] This is very much like what the Bible explains happened before the days of Noah, in Genesis 6:1-7. Noah being no other than the prophet Noah-Ra from Atlantis who brought out the Chosen People before the continent sank under the waters of the Atlantic Ocean as narrated by Samael Aun Weor in his book The Revolution of Beelzebub.
According to Samael Aun Weor in his work The Social Christ, Bulganin, Prime Minister of the Soviet Union OKed the experiment to inseminate Russian women with the semen of chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas. The results are known as the Bulganeans, Bulganin's children, the ape-children of the Soviet Union.[60]
Normal sex obeys the animal instinct of procreation. According to Aun Weor, as long as humans are engaged in the process of animal procreation without practicing Scientific Chastity in the Perfect Marriage, they are prone to degenerate.[61]

[edit] Praxis




Abraxas


Samael Aun Weor emphasizes that his doctrine is experiential, and must be put into practice for it to be of any value to the student.[52][62] Likewise, throughout his works there are hundreds of techniques and exercises that supposedly are of help in the development of psychic powers e. g. leaving the dense physical body at will (astral projection) [63] in order to be taught in the schools of the "Higher Worlds."[64] It should be noted that the techniques are always combined with meditation and sexual transmutation, and the perfection of such powers may take more than one lifetime.[65][66]
It is stated that if a student is successful in awakening consciousness, he or she will eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Samael Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness are not aware of their postmortem condition just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.[67]

[edit] Psychology




Double-headed eagle


The basis of Samael Aun Weor's Practical Work is of a psychological nature. He states in many of his books that the purpose of his doctrine is to effect a psychological change. The terms Gnostic, Esoteric or Revolutionary Psychology are used to describe the psychological methods taught, and are said to be synonymous with the psychological teachings of religion.[68][69]
A fundamental axiom presented is that an ordinary human being is not really human at all, but rather an intellectual animal (a rational animal) with consciousness asleep.[70] [71]According to Samael Aun Weor, a true human being is someone who has no psychological imperfection, an image of God, as in Jesus' saying, "Become perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect."[72][73] Samael Aun Weor writes of the awakening of consciousness as being very similar to the traditional Buddhist understanding, and throughout his works he describes many analogous processes as they are spoken of in different religions.
With the technique of awakening Kundalini, and here he parts company with Gurdjieff who considers Kundalini as something undesirable and unnecessary for man,[74] he taught the doctrine of the annihilation of the ego.[75] He taught that one’s ego is really not one but many, or a multitude of independent, contradictory desires. Likewise, each person's ego is said to actually contain many "I’s," many "egos," many "aggregates" and even demons. Each desire is an "I" and each "I" has its own specific causes and conditions that lead to its personification at a particular time. This is the mechanism behind what is commonly called "changing one’s mind" (metanoia)[76] because when one "I" changes to another a literal exchange of personified psychological aggregates has taken place.[77] This "doctrine of the many" is the same as that taught by G.I. Gurdjieff and because of this Samael Aun Weor was often accused of plagiarism. To this he responded that Gurdjieff was not the author of this doctrine and that its origin is found in Egypt and Tibet.[78][79][80]
Consciousness is described as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Samael Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions (all three are essentially the same thing). It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand consciousness asleep, which implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through meditation and self-observation. It is stated many times that the awakening of consciousness is the only way to acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering.[81][82]
The purpose of the psychological work is to dissolve all the psychological aggregates one has accumulated. The term "psychological or mystical death"[83] is often used to describe the process one must undergo in order to reach liberation.[84] [85]"Psychological aggregates" are commonly known simply as aggregates in Buddhism, yet it is taught that other religions used a more veiled or less sophisticated method to describe them, such as: the Legion of Satan that Jesus is described as removing from a man in Mark 5 in one of the alleged Miracles of Jesus;[86][87] the killing of the "unbelievers" in Islam; Moses escaping the tyranny of the Egyptians;[88] Arjuna fighting against his own blood (the ego);[89] the demons of Seth[90] that attack Osiris;[91] Jesus throwing the merchants out of the temple;[92] the archetypical death and resurrection of the "Solar Hero" exemplified in the stories of Jesus and Osiris; the descent to Dante's Inferno[93] (representing our unconsciousness) or Paradise Lost Pandemonium[94] in order to accomplish a great task, such as those performed by Hercules or Orpheus; the archetypical Dragon (ego) that must be slayed by the Knight, etc.[3] Samael Aun Weor states that this specific paradigm is called "The Doctrine of the Many" and has been taught in esoteric schools and religions since the beginning of time.[95]
In order to achieve psychological transformation, extensive methods of meditation, self-observation, and sexual transmutation are taught and recommended to be practiced on a daily basis.[82] The goal of psychological work is the awakening of consciousness and ultimately the state of Paramarthasatya or Adi-Buddha Yoga.[55]

[edit] Physiology and Sexology




Chakras




“
Indeed, sexual energy is without a doubt the most subtle and powerful energy normally produced and transported through the human organism. Everything that a Human Being is, including the three spheres of thought, feeling and will, is none other than the exact outcome of distinct modifications of sexual energy. [96]
”


Sex is the chief form of slavery and also the main possibility of liberation.[97]
Basic physiology is studied, mostly endocrinology and the hormonal influence of primary and secondary sexual characteristics.[98][99][100]It is taught that there are three fundamental nervous systems: cerebrospinal nervous system, grand sympathetic nervous system, and the Parasympathetic nervous system. These nervous systems are referred to as the "Three Brains" or three centers of the intellectual animal, and are named Intellectual Center, the Emotional Center, and the Motor-Instinctual-Sexual Center. Each center is studied in relation to the types of energies or "occult hydrogens" that animate them, the frequency at which each center operates (sexual center being the fastest, then emotional, then intellectual), and how psychological aggregates form and act within each center: psychological aggregates that are expressed through the intellect one way and through the emotions in a different way, etc.[101][102]
The three centers are directly related to the Trinity, Trimurti, or threefold-ness of creation, the intellect being related to the Father (Kether, Affirmation, Positive), the emotion related to the Son, (Chokmah, Denial, Negation), and the sexual center related to the Holy Spirit (Binah, Reconcile, Neutral). The primary energy of the intellectual brain (Father) is the air, which is then placed in the bloodstream which is related to the emotional brain (Son), and lastly the final condensation of blood is found in the semen or sexual hormones, which is directly related to the Holy Spirit: that which impregnates or manifests creation, Shakti, etc.[103][104][105]
Samael Aun Weor teaches that psychological aggregates form in one of these three centers; therefore, it is said that there are three fundamental defects: the demon of the mind related to the intellectual center, the demon of desire related to the emotional center, and the demon of evil will related to the motor-instinctual-sexual center. They are collectively referred to as the "Three Traitors", and many references to religion are found that are held to symbolize them, for example: Judas (desire), Pilate (intellect), and Caiaphas (will) who crucify Jesus; Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum who murder Hiram Abiff [106]; Seth, whose homosexual inclinations and actions are well known,[107] in the form of the serpent Apophis and its two monstrous helpers Sebau and Nak [108][109]murders Osiris;[110][111] the three furies who attack Orestes; the three daughters of Mara who attack Buddha and who are conquered through right Thinking (Intellectual Center), right Feeling (Emotional Center), and right Action (Motor-Instinctual-Sexual Center) (see Noble Eightfold Path).[112][113]
Occult or esoteric physiology is also studied, which refers to the study of the supra-sensible bodies of minerals, plants, animals (rational and irrational), and human beings. It is said that everyone contains seven bodies, closely related to the Theosophical septenary, which Samael Aun Weor calls: physical, vital, emotional (astral), mental, causal, buddhic and atmic.[114] [115]Aun Weor differentiates between an intellectual animal and an authentic human being through the differences in the vehicles of emotion (astral body), mind (mental body) and will (causal body). Intellectual animals (ordinary man and woman) are said to contain the Lunar Astral Body, the Lunar Mental Body, and the Lunar Causal Body, each referred to by different names in different schools of Occultism. It is stated that these lunar bodies are the result of mechanical evolution through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms and therefore, they are of an infrahuman or animal quality.[116] The only true difference between the rational animal and irrational animals is the intellect, which gives the former the ability to become human, or as Samael Aun Weor states, the intellectual animal has the "seed" or potential of a human latently existing within its sexual organs.[117][118]
What are called authentic human beings, although physically appearing identical, have crystallized the Solar Bodies: Solar Astral Body, Solar Mental Body, and Solar Causal Body. Lunar bodies are vehicles that receive the energy of creation (that is, God) at the level of an animal, while the solar bodies permit the reception of a much greater voltage allowing greater levels of wisdom and superior emotion to be incarnated. Samael Aun Weor states that the solar bodies are collectively referred to as vehicles of the "soul". [119]
Samael Aun Weor asseverates that the solar bodies are formed in the same manner that physical bodies are formed: through use of the sexual function. In order to form the solar bodies, sexual transmutation via sexual magic is taught.[120] [121]Sexual magic is the arousal of sexual energies through the act of coitus between husband and wife, but instead of expelling those energies through orgasm they are transmuted into higher octaves of energy.[122] Each successive Solar Body is the result of the saturation of transmuted sexual energy at its respective octave: first, the "Christ Astral" is formed by transmuting the sex energy into a second octave; second, the "Christ Mind" is formed by saturating, condensing or crystallizing the sexual energy into a third octave, and the causal body or "Christ Will" is formed by transmuting the sexual energy called "Hydrogen SI-12", into a fourth octave.[123][124] The "birth" of the solar bodies is what Samael Aun Weor states is the true meaning of being "born again." It is taught that the solar bodies are referred to in the Bible as the three sons of Noah or the three Christians in the (alchemical) furnace of Nebuchadrezzar.[125]
The topic of sexuality is approached from a very stern point of view, and it is indeed the crux of Samael Aun Weor’s entire message. He states that there are three fundamental types of sexuality: suprasexuality, which is the sexual functioning of someone like Buddha or Jesus, who naturally transmutes all their energy perfectly; normal sexuality, which is defined as those who have no sexual conflict and who transmute their sexual energy; finally infrasexuality, a category which contains homosexuality, adultery, prostitution, masturbation, abortion, bestiality and any other "abuse" of the sexual energy.[126][127]

[edit] Homosexuality
The way to hell is paved with good intentions. Life in hell is involved in two different spheres of activity: the Sphere of Lilith, the mother of homosexuality and the Sphere of Nahemah, the mother of prostitution.[128][129] According to Samael Aun Weor, as with everything that one is born with, such as one’s psychology, family, physical body, geographical location and so on, homosexuality is the outcome of karma (Lilith was once the mate of Samael).[130] Homosexuality is said to be a modification of one’s nervous system due to karma related to the misuse of sexual energy in a previous life. Thus according to this notion, the fact that more people are being born as homosexuals is a sign of society’s furthering sexual degeneration.[131] Samael Aun Weor does not deny that homosexuals have a modified nervous system and authentically desire the same sex, but states that because homosexuals cannot create, not even physically, that they also cannot create spiritually, and for this reason they have degenerated, or literally "lost the ability to generate." Likewise, Samael Aun Weor calls homosexuals "rotten seeds" in his work Yes there is Hell, a Devil, and Karma because unlike heterosexuals they do not have the ability to create the Solar Bodies. This does not damn the soul-essence of a homosexual, as it is implied that if a homosexual works on him or herself and deeply yearns to change, after death he or she may acquire a heterosexual body to use in the next reincarnation, but it is also stated that this is something very rare.[132][133] A prostitute has a better chance e. g. Mary Magdalene[134] However, if Samael was once the mate of Lilith, there is no reason to despair.[135]

[edit] Soteriology




Padmasambhava


Soteriology the study of salvation is presented in the light of every notable religion yet usually with special differences not held by orthodox interpretations. There are many degrees of salvation generally accomplished by paying one’s karma, removing the psychological imperfections and finally creating the solar bodies. The idea held by many religions that belief in God alone achieves salvation is categorically rejected.[55][136]
Many different levels of salvation are explained, each depending upon the willpower of the individual accomplishing it. For those who do not remove their psychological imperfection (ego) – which is the cause of karma and the suffering of humanity – after approximately 108 rebirths they will have their ego removed forcefully through mechanical devolution within the infradimensions (Hell). Here it is said that "Mother Nature" mechanically pays out one’s accumulated karma through a great deal of suffering over thousands of years until one is returned to the state of an innocent elemental, or Essence. This is said to be a state of being that is total happiness, yet not cognizant happiness and therefore not complete happiness. It should be noted that Hell is not taught as a place of eternal damnation, just a place to pay one’s karma, and in fact it is seen as a part of God's grace because if the ego is not removed forcefully, these souls would continue to suffer indefinitely. It is held that after Hell, the elemental is reinserted into the mechanics of evolution in order to once again attempt to gain conscious happiness: They are first inserted at the basic level of existence (minerals), and through millions of years, transmigrate through increasingly complex organisms until the state of intellectual animal is reached again.[137][138]
For those who do work on themselves, depending on the degree of perfection, happiness and wisdom they wish to attain, two distinct paths emerge: the Straight Path of the Razor's Edge (full of dangers inside and out) and the Spiral Path (the easy way out). The Spiral Path involves reaching a state of relative enlightenment by choosing the enjoyment of the Higher Worlds, Heaven or Nirvana), and occasionally returning to a physical body in order to pay out a little more karma and help humanity in the process.[137] Samael Aun Weor refers to these as the Pratyeka Buddhas and Sravakas, and that the vast majority who reach this state choose the Spiral Path because it is very easy and enjoyable. The dangerous Straight Path of the Razor's Edge is the Path of the Bodhisattva who renounces the happiness of the Higher Worlds (Nirvana) in order to help humanity. In the doctrine of Samael Aun Weor, the Bodhisattva has a very specific definition, as it is not merely someone who has taken the Bodhisattva vows. It is the physical (Malkuth), vital (Yesod), astral (Hod), mental (Netzach) and causal (Tiphereth) vehicles – in other words the human soul – of a self-realized spirit, (Geburah-Chesed) who has chosen the extremely dangerous Straight Path of the Razor's Edge in order to incarnate the Christ (Kether-Binah-Chokmah). In other words, the Bodhisattva is the "Son" of a self-realized God who is trying to return to the Absolute or 13th Aeon. [139][140]
Christ is viewed as the savior but not as traditionally understood by contemporary Christianity. Instead, Christ is an impersonal force or intelligence that emanates from the Absolute and is also referred to as the Cosmic Christ. Christ is said to be before Jesus, and is represented in different traditions with names such as Thoth, Ormuz, Ahura Mazda, Krishna, Osiris, Zeus, Jupiter, Quetzalcoatl, Okidanokh, Kulkulcan,Khristos, Chrestos, Christus, Messiah, Baldur, Mahavatar Babaji and Avalokitesvara. It is held that Christ enters into and exalts any individual who is properly prepared, which denotes the complete annihilation of the ego, the exhaustion of all karma and the birth of the solar vehicles, the latter is necessary to handle the super high voltage of Christ. Samael Aun Weor writes that only those who choose the previously mentioned Straight Path of the Razor's Edge can incarnate the Christ because the Spiral Path is not a path of total sacrifice. Likewise, any true Bodhisattva has incarnated the Christ or is in process of doing so. It is said that in history Christ incarnated in Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna, Moses, Padmasambhava, John the Baptist, Milarepa, Joan of Arc, Fu Hsi, Ramakrishna as well as many others now forgotten by time e. g. Zanoni[141][142][143][144]
It is important to notice that some of these individuals represent Christ as an impersonal force e. g. Jesus, meaning that although he was an individual Christ, he taught the doctrine of the Cosmic Christ, intentionally molding his physical life after the psychological processes that one undergoes to incarnate the Christ. As with Buddha, Jesus is seen as a Bodhisattva who came to help humanity. Jesus is viewed as the Savior of the World because he is a Paramarthasatya (an inhabitant of the Absolute) that physically incarnated (a very rare occurrence) specifically for the sake of poor suffering humanity. According to Samael Aun Weor, Jesus purposefully played out physically the internal or psychological struggle one must undergo in the path of Self-Realization; thus, the Gospels are a mixture of reality and kabbalistic, initiatic symbolism.[145] [146][147] According to Samael Aun Weor, there is the historic Christ as depicted in Christian Churches; then, there is the Christ of Transubstantiation to be known exclusively through the Gnostic Church;[148] and finally, there is the Apocalyptic Christ who is to come with the New Jerusalem, after the Great Fire Cataclysm that will consume the world. This is all explained in The Aquarian Message, an interpretation of the Book of Revelation by Samael Aun Weor.[149] "...there will be a new heaven and a new earth."[150]

[edit] Eschatology
Eschatology deals with the things that are to come. Samael Aun Weor wrote a tract titled Yes, there is a devil; yes, there is a hell; yes, there is Karma depicting what may actually happen to the individual. In regard to the world at large and what may surely happen there, he wrote The Aquarian Message. According to St. Peter, in his Second Epistle, he is "...looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat." [151]
According to Samael Aun Weor, Maitreya Buddha, Kalki Avatar of the New Age of Aquarius, "...Prostitution of solar energy exists in the hydrogen bomb." This is the worst kind of Black Magic whose outcome will be total devastation and the decline and death of all living matter in a scale totally unheard of.[152]
