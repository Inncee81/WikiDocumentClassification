[edit] Setting




Cyborg shell


Ghost in the Shell is a futuristic police thriller dealing with the exploits of the cyborg Motoko Kusanagi, a member of a covert operations division of the Japanese National Public Safety Commission known as Section 9. The unit specializes in fighting technology-related crimes. She may be named after one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan and Shirow makes reference to them at the end of the second manga.[citation needed] Although supposedly equal to all other members, Kusanagi fills the leadership role in the team, and is usually referred to as "the Major" due to her past rank in the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. She is capable of superhuman feats, and bionically specialized for her job — her body is almost completely mechanized; only her brain and a segment of her spinal cord remain organic.
The setting of Ghost in the Shell is cyberpunk or postcyberpunk, similar to that of William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy. Kusanagi and her colleagues face external threats and also suffer internal conflict over their own natures.

[edit] Media

[edit] Manga
Main articles: Ghost in the Shell (manga), Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface, and Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor
A continuation of the first manga can be found in the second manga series entitled Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface. Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor includes a series of stories originally intended to be serialized in the initial print of Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface.

[edit] Films
Main articles: Ghost in the Shell (film), Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, and Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society
The manga was first adapted into a theatrical anime film adaptation in 1995, entitled Ghost in the Shell, directed by Mamoru Oshii. The film was followed by a theatrical film sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, produced in 2004, which was also directed by Oshii and places the character of Batou in the lead role. Both were based on storylines from the first manga. A third film, Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society, was created after the anime series and directed by Kenji Kamiyama, premiering on the SKY Perfect satellite television network on September 1, 2006. Solid State Society is a sequel to the anime series storyline, and so takes place in a separate continuity. It does not connect with either of Oshii's works.
The original film was redone in 2008, updating the computer graphics and re-recording the sound in 6.1 surround sound. The new version premiered on the 12th of July 2008 in Japan.[1]
As of 2008, DreamWorks acquired the rights to produce a live-action film adaptation of the original manga with Steven Spielberg. So far, Avi Arad and Steven Paul are confirmed producers; Jamie Moss will be adapting the manga into a screenplay.[2] The live-action film is set to be released in 2011.[3] Charize Theron could be Motoko Kusanagi (with other name) in the film.

[edit] Anime series
Main articles: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG
The series has been adapted into two anime series. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex was written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama and produced by Production I.G, airing on Animax from 1 October 2002 to 25 March 2003 with a total of 26 episodes. Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG followed Stand Alone Complex as the second season, also written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama and produced by Production I.G. 2nd GIG aired on Animax from 1 January 2004 to 8 January 2005, with a total of 26 episodes.

[edit] Video games
Main articles: Ghost in the Shell (video game) and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (video game)
A PlayStation game was released in 1997, developed by Exact and published by THQ. A second game bearing the anime TV series title Stand Alone Complex was released in November 2004 on PlayStation 2, developed by SCEJ and Cavia and published by Bandai. A game of the same name developed by G-Artists and published by Bandai was released in 2005 for PlayStation Portable, but this is a sequel to the PlayStation 2 game, with a completely different storyline, setting and gameplay.

[edit] Chronology
The films and anime series are set in alternate universes, with the original Ghost in the Shell film set in 2029, and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence set in 2032. The anime series, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG, are set in the year 2030. The third film, Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society, follows up on many of the events that ended the second anime season, Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG.

[edit] Impact and influence

The Wachowski brothers, makers of the Matrix trilogy, have commented on the influence of Ghost in the Shell in an interview.[4] Producer Joel Silver also stated in an interview on the Animatrix DVD that he was shown the Ghost in the Shell movie during a pitch from the Wachowski brothers to indicate the style and look of the film they wanted for The Matrix.

[edit] Academic influence
Ghost in the Shell was analyzed together with William Gibson's book Neuromancer in chapter 4 "Orienting the Future" of Wendy Hui Kyong Chun's book "Control and Freedom - Power and Paranoia in the Age of Fiber Optics" (2006, The MIT Press). She looks at the aspect of high-tech Orientalism put forth in both works.
