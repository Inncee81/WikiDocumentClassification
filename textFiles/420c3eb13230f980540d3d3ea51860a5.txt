[edit] Etymology
Main article: Name of the Philippines
The name Philippines was derived from King Philip II of Spain in the 16th century. Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos used the name Las Islas Filipinas (The Philippine Islands) in honor of the Prince of Asturias (Spain) during his expedition to the Philippines, originally referring to the islands of Leyte, and Samar.[11] The name itself is Greek, and can be traced to the name of the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, Greek: Φίλιππος — φίλος philos (meaning beloved, loving); ίππος hippos (meaning horse).[12] Despite the presence of other names, the name Filipinas (Philippines) was adopted as the name of the entire archipelago.
The official name of the Philippines, however, changed throughout the course of Philippine history. During the Philippine Revolution, the Philippines was officially called República Filipina or the Philippine Republic. From the period of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War, until the Commonwealth period, United States colonial authorities referred to the Philippines as the Philippine Islands, a translation of the original Spanish name. It was during the American period that the name Philippines began to appear, a name that was adopted as its current official name.[4]

[edit] Prehistory




Banaue Rice Terraces, part of the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, are an indigenous man-made structure which dates back 2,000 to 6,000 years. The structure is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Archeological, and paleontological discoveries show that humans existed in Palawan around 30,000 to 50,000 BC. An aboriginal people of the Philippine Islands, the Negritos, are an Australo-Melanesian people who arrived in the Philippines at least 30,000 years ago. An ethnic group known as the Austronesian people called Malayo-Polynesians, originated from the populations of Taiwanese aborigines that migrated from mainland Asia approximately 6,000 years ago, who settled in the islands, and eventually migrated to Indonesia, Malaysia, and soon after, to the Polynesian Islands, and Madagascar.[13]
The islands were known as Lusung Dao to the Chinese[14] Suvarnadvipa to the Hindus[15] Zabag to the Persians, and Arabs[16] and Chryse to the Egyptians & Greeks which is the short name of "Chryse Chersonessos" which means island of gold, it is located to the east of Khruses Kersonenson (The Golden Peninsula) which refers to Malaysia, as described by the geographer Ptolemy.[17] The islands had cultural ties with Malaysia, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries during the prehistoric period.[18] It also had trade relations with Ancient China, Japan,[19] Persia[20] and Egypt.[21]




A pre-Hispanic indigenous village.


Before the arrival of Islam; Animism syncretized with Hinduism[22] and Vajrayana Buddhism[23] were the religions practiced by various Philippine indigenous kingdoms.
Islam was brought to the Philippines by traders, and proselytizers from Arabia via Malaysia and Indonesia.[24] By the 13th century, Islam was established in the Sulu Archipelago, and spread to Mindanao, the Visayas, and Luzon by 1565. These Muslims established Islamic communities. By the early 16th century there were several villages (Barangays) either ruled by Datus, Rajahs, or Sultans.
There were no unified political state that encompassed the archipelago that was to be known as the Philippines, and the area was ruled by competing thalassocracies such as the Kingdom of Namayan[25] the Dynasty of Tondo[26] the Madya-as Confederacy[27] the Rajahnates of Butuan, and Cebu, and the sultanates of Maguindanao, and Sulu[28] some of which were under the Malayan empires of Srivijaya, Majapahit, and the Brunei Sultanate.[29][30]

[edit] Colonial period
In the service of Spain, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, and his crew started their voyage on September 20, 1519 from Spain. Magellan sighted Samar on March 17, 1521, on the next day, they reached Homonhon. They reached the island of Mazaua on March 28, 1521 where the first mass in the Philippines was celebrated on March 31, 1521.[31] Magellan arrived at Cebu on April 7, 1521, befriending Rajah Humabon, and converting his family, and other nearby islanders to Christianity.[31] However, Magellan would be killed in the Battle of Mactan by native warriors led by Datu Lapu-Lapu, a rival of Rajah Humabon. The islands is located in the East Indies, and the Spaniards called the indigenous people, Indios (Indians).
Colonization began when Philip II of Spain ordered successive expeditions. Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565, and formed the first Spanish settlements in Cebu. In 1571, the Spaniards established Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies. [32]
Spanish rule brought political unification to an archipelago of previously independent kingdoms, and communities which later became the Philippines, and introduced elements of western civilisation such as the plow, the wheel, printing, the code of law, and the Gregorian calendar.[33] The Philippines was governed as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1565 to 1821, and administered directly from Spain from 1821 to 1898. During this time, towns, cities, and provinces were founded, infrastructures built, new crops, and livestock introduced, and trade flourished. The Manila Galleon which linked Manila to Acapulco carried silk, spices, ivory, and porcelain to the Americas, and silver from Mexico on the return voyage to the Philippines. Spain engaged into conflict with indigenous revolts, and several foreign threats from Chinese sea pirates, England, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Roman Catholic missionaries converted most of the inhabitants to Christianity, and founded numerous schools, universities and hospitals. European immigration to the islands created a new class of Criollo (Spaniard born in the Philippines), and Mestizo (mixed Spanish, and Malayan). In 1863 the Spanish colonial government introduced free public education in Spanish.[34] The first official census in the Philippines was carried out in 1878. The country's population as of December 31, 1877 was recorded at 5,567,685 persons.[35]
In the 1700s, the Philippines opened its forts to world trade. The economy increased, and criollos, and mestizos on the islands became wealthy. In the 1800s, the Suez Canal was opened, and reduced travel time between Spain, and the Philippines. This began a migration of Europeans to the islands. The influx of Spaniards secularized Philippine churches, and government positions traditionally held by the criollos. Also, the ideals of the French, and American Revolutions began to spread to the Philippines. Criollo insurgency resulted in the Novales revolt, and Cavite Mutiny of 1872. Colonial authorities suppressed the criollos by imprisonment, deportation, and execution of the leaders of the revolution. Among them were priests Mariano Gómez, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora who would be remembered in Philippine history as the Gomburza. The execution of the three priests laid the foundation of the Philippine Revolution.[36]

The migration of Filipinos to Europe created a community of expatriates. The Propaganda Movement, which included Filipino patriot José Rizal were founded in Spain. The propagandists clamored for political, and social reforms, which included representation in the Spanish Cortes for Filipinos, and secularization of Philippine churches. The propagandist lobbied for their cause through the paper La Solidaridad (The Solidarity). They were also able to gain the support of Spanish liberals such as Morayta. Unable to gain reforms, Rizal returned to the Philippines, and established La Liga Filipina to organize patriots in Manila, and produce funds for La Solidaridad. Rizal was arrested, and deported to Dapitan. Radical members of La Liga Filipina (The Philippine League), under the leadership of Andrés Bonifacio, established the Katipunan in 1896. The objective were to organize Philippine independence from Spain.
Rizal was executed for inspiring the Philippine revolution on December 30, 1896.[37] The revolution in Cavite El Viejo had achieved success and the leadership of the revolution eventually passed from Bonifacio to Emilio Aguinaldo. A ceasefire was agreed at the Treaty of Biak-na-Bato, and Filipino leaders agreed to exile in Hong Kong. Governor General Fernando Primo de Rivera proclaimed the revolution over in May 17, 1897.[38]
The Spanish-American War began in Cuba in 1898, and soon reached the Philippines when Commodore George Dewey, and Emilio Aguinaldo defeated the Spanish squadron at the Battle of Manila Bay. The Philippines declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898. In 1899, the Primera República Filipina or the First Philippine Republic was proclaimed in Malolos, Bulacan. In the Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded the Philippines, together with Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States. As a result of the treaty, and a manifesto by the United States declaring American intentions to colonize the Philippines, resulted into conflict between Filipinos, and Americans. Emilio Aguinaldo tried to ease the tensions but Americans were decided on making the Philippines a United States colony. The Philippine-American War began when an American soldier killed a Filipino soldier in the bridge of San Juan. The United States proclaimed the war ended when Aguinaldo was captured by American soldiers on March 23, 1901, but the struggle continued until 1913 claiming almost a million lives. The United States suppressed Philippine independence by establishing an American government. The Philippines status as a colony changed when it became the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935. Plans for independence over the next decade were interrupted by World War II when Japan invaded, and occupied the Philippines. United States, and Philippine troops defeated Japan in 1944. On July 4, 1946, the Philippines gained independence from the United States. [4]

[edit] Contemporary era

The Philippines faced political instability that plagued the country. Since 1946, remnants of the Hukbalahap rebel army continued to roam the rural regions of the Philippines, disgruntled after the Philippine government had rejected their contribution during World War II.
Attempts of reconciliation were formed by former Philippine president, Ramón Magsaysay. In the 1960s, the Philippine national policies were initiated by Diosdado Macapagal, that included recognition of the Philippine Declaration of Independence, and the President legacy of Emilio Aguinaldo, and José P. Laurel.
The 1960s were a period of economic growth for the Philippines which developed to be one of the wealthiest in Asia. Ferdinand Marcos was elected president. Barred from seeking a third term, he declared Martial law on September 21, 1972, under the guise of political conflict, and resurgent Communist, and Islamic insurgencies, and governed the Philippines by decree, along with his wife Imelda Marcos.
Returning from exile in the United States, Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., was assassinated at the Manila International Airport (also called the Ninoy Aquino International Airport) on August 21, 1983. In 1986, the People Power Revolution occurred. The people gathered, and protested in EDSA, upon the organization of the Archbishop of Manila founded by Priest Jaime Cardinal Sin. It was to oppose the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. After losing the election to Corazón Aquino, who became the first woman President of the Philippines, Marcos, and his allies departed to Hawaii in exile.
The return of democracy, and government reforms after the events of 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, a Communist insurgency, and an Islamic separatist organization. The Philippine economy improved during the administration of Fidel V. Ramos, who was elected in 1992.[39] However, the economic improvements were negated at the onset of the East Asian financial crisis in 1997. The 2001 EDSA Revolution led to the downfall of the following Philippine president, Joseph Ejercito Estrada. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took Philippine leadership in 2001 following the impeachment of the Estrada government.

The Philippines has a presidential, unitary form of government (with some modification; there is one autonomous region largely free from the national government), where the President functions as both head of state, and head of government, and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president is elected by popular vote to a single six year term, during which time she or he appoints, and presides over the cabinet.[3]
The bicameral Congress is composed of a Senate, serving as the upper house whose members are elected to a six year term, and a House of Representatives serving as the lower house whose members are elected to a three year term, and are elected from both legislative districts, and through sectoral representation.[3]
The judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court, composed of a Chief Justice as its presiding officer, and fourteen associate justices, all appointed by the Philippine President from nominations submitted by the Judicial and Bar Council.[3] Attempts to amend the constitution to either a federal, unicameral or parliamentary form of government have been satisfactory since the Ramos administration. [40]
The Philippines is a founding, and active member of the United Nations since its inception on October 24, 1945, and is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Philippines is also a member of the East Asia Summit (EAS), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Latin Union, and a member of the Group of 24. The Philippines is a major non-NATO ally of the United States, but also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement.[3]

The Philippines constitutes an archipelago of 7,107 islands with a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers (116,000 square miles). It is located between 116° 40', and 126° 34' E. longitude, and 4° 40', and 21° 10' N. latitude, and borders the Philippine Sea on the east, the South China Sea on the west, and the Celebes Sea on the south. The island of Borneo is located a few hundred kilometers southwest, and Taiwan directly located to the north. The Moluccas, and Sulawesi are located to the south-southwest, and Palau is located to the east of the Philippine Sea.[3]
The islands are commonly divided into three island groups: Luzon (Regions I to V, NCR and CAR), Visayas (VI to VIII), and Mindanao (IX to XIII and ARMM). The busy port of Manila, on Luzon, is the national capital, and the second largest city after Quezon City.[3]




Mayon Volcano in Luzon.


Most of the mountainous islands were covered in tropical rainforest, and are volcanic in origin. The highest mountain is Mount Apo located in Mindanao measuring at 2,954 meters (9,692 ft) above sea level. There are many active volcanos such as Mayon Volcano, Mount Pinatubo, and Taal Volcano. The Philippines is also located within the typhoon belt of the Western Pacific, and approximately 19 typhoons strike per year.[43]
Located on the northwestern fringes of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Islands of the Philippines have experienced frequent seismic, and volcanic activities. Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily in the Philippines, though most are too weak to be felt. The last earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.[44]
The longest river is the Cagayan River in northern Luzon. Manila Bay is connected to Laguna de Bay by means of the Pasig River. Subic Bay, the Davao Gulf, and the Moro Gulf are some of the important bays. Transversing the San Juanico Strait is the San Juanico Bridge (considered a point of vital national infrastructure, and capacity), that connects the islands of Samar, and Leyte.[45]

[edit] Natural resources

Philippine Eagle, one of the Philippines' most recognized bird species.


The Philippines is well-endowed with natural resources in areas such as agriculture, environment, and minerals. It has fertile, arable lands, diverse flora and fauna, extensive coastlines, and rich mineral deposits.[46]
Endemic species include the tamaraw of Mindoro, and the tarsier of Bohol. The Philippines have a relative lack of predators, with the exception of snakes, such as pythons, and cobras, and birds of prey, such as the national bird, the Philippine eagle.[47] Other animals include the palm civet cat, known for its strange appetite for coffee,[48] the Mouse deer, and the Visayan warty pig,[49] as well as several species of bats.
Rainforests boasts an amazing array of flora, including several types of orchids, and rafflesia.[50] The narra is treated as the most important type of hardwood while banyan trees or the balete are culturally important with regards to superstition.[51] The country's major crops include rice, corn, sugarcane, coconut, abaca and tobacco. Rice is the most important source of food along with corn. The coconut, mango, watermelon, and other native fruits are an important source of Philippine income.
Due to the volcanic nature of the islands, mineral deposits are abundant. This also allows the Philippines to become a powerhouse with regards to geothermal energy.[52][53]
The territorial waters measure as much as 1.67 million square kilometers, producing a unique, and diverse marine life. Of the 2,400 fish species found in the Philippines, 65 have good commercial value. Other marine products include corals, pearls, crabs ,and seaweeds.[46][54] The rain forests offer prime habitat for more than 530 species of birds, including the Philippine eagle, some 800 species of orchids, and some 8,500 species of flowering plants.[55]

[edit] Climate
Main article: Climate of the Philippines




Limestone islands of El Nido in Palawan.


The Philippines has a tropical marine climate, and is usually hot, humid, and tropical. The average yearly temperature is around 26.5°C (79.7°F). There are three recognized seasons: "Tag-init" or "Tag-araw" (the hot season or summer from March to May), "Tag-ulan" (the rainy season from June to November), and "Tag-lamig" (the cold season from December to February). The southwest monsoon (from May to October) is known as the "Habagat", and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon (from November to April) as the "Amihan".[56] The coolest month is January and the warmest is May. Both temperature, and humidity levels reach the maximum in April and May.[3] Manila, and most of the lowland areas are hot, and dusty from March to May.[57] Even at this time, however, temperatures rarely rise above 37°C. Mean annual sea-level temperatures rarely fall below 27°C. Annual rainfall measures as much as 5,000 millimeters in the mountainous east coast section of the country, but less than 1,000 millimeters in some of the sheltered valleys. Sitting astride the typhoon belt, most of the country experiences an annual onslaught of torrential rains and thunderstorms from July to October.[58]

The Philippines is a newly industrialized country and considered as new Asian Tiger economy since 1990 with an economy anchored on agriculture but with substantial contributions from manufacturing, mining, remittances from overseas Filipinos, and service industries such as tourism, and increasingly, business process outsourcing.[59][60] The Philippines is listed in the roster of the "Next Eleven" economies. With its GDP, Philippines was the 5th richest country in South East Asia, lead by Singapore,Brunei,Malaysia and Thailand.
The Philippine economy were largely anchored on the Manila-Acapulco galleon during the Spanish period, and bilateral trade with the United States during the American period. Pro-Filipino economic policies were first implemented during the tenure of Carlos P. Garcia with the "Filipino First" policy. By the 1960s, the Philippine economy was regarded as the second largest in Asia, next to Japan. However, the leardership of Ferdinand Marcos would prove disastrous to the Philippine economy, by transforming the market economy of the Philippines into a centrally planned economy. The Philippines suffered severe economic recession, only to recover in the 1990s with a program of economic liberalization, and the impeachment of the Marcos government, and the system of cronyism under the leadership of Fidel V. Ramos. Today, the Philippines have produced a mixed economy.[39]

The Asian Financial Crisis affected the Philippine economy to an extent, resulting in a lingering decline of the value of the Philippine peso, and falls in the stock market, although the extent to which it was affected was not as severe as that of its Asian neighbors. This is largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the Philippine government partly as a result of decades of monitoring, and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund, in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth.[39] By 2004, the Philippine economy experienced six percent growth in gross domestic product, and 7.3% in 2007,[61] in line with the "7, 8, 9" project of the government to accelerate GDP growth by 2009.[62]

In a bid to further strengthen the Philippine economy, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo pledged to make the Philippines a developed country by 2020. As part of this goal, she instituted five economic "super regions" to concentrate on the economic strengths of various regions of the good Philippines, as well as the implementation of tax reforms, continued privatization of state assets, and the building-up of infrastructure in various areas of the Philippines.
The Philippine economy is heavily reliant on remittances as a source of foreign currency, surpassing foreign direct investment. China, and India have emerged as a major economic competitors, siphoning away investors who would otherwise have invested in the Philippines, particularly telecommunications companies. Regional development is also somewhat uneven, with Luzon, and Metro Manila in particular gaining most of the new economic growth at the expense of the other regions,[63] although the government has taken steps to distribute economic growth by promoting investment in other areas of The Philippines.
The Philippines is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is also a member of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Colombo Plan, and the G-77, and other International organization.[64]

Population growth of the Philippines.


Main articles: Demographics of the Philippines, Filipino people, and Overseas Filipino
The Philippines is the world's 12th most populous country, with a population of over 90 million as of 2008.[5][7] In 2007, 8% of Filipinos are living abroad as migrant laborers. Roughly half of the Philippine population resides on the island of Luzon. Manila, the capital city, is the eleventh most populous metropolitan area in the world. The literacy rate was 92.6% in 2003,[65][66] and about equal for males and females.[4] Life expectancy is 71.23 years, with 73.6 years for females and 69.8 years for males. Population growth rate between 1995 to 2000 is 3.21% but has dramatically fell to 1.59% for 2005 to 2010.

[edit] Ethnic groups

Map of the dominant ethnicities of the Philippines by province.


The majority of Filipinos are descended from a group of indigenous people from Taiwan known as the Austronesian. The Malayo Polynesian-speaking peoples, a branch of the Austronesian-speaking peoples, migrated to the Philippines thousands of years ago, and brought their knowledge of agriculture, and ocean-sailing technology. Filipinos to this day are composed of various Malayo-Polynesian ethnic groups, including the Visayans, the Tagalog, the Ilocano, the Moro, the Kapampangan, the Bicolano, the Pangasinense, the Igorot, the Lumad, the Mangyan, the Ibanag, the Badjao, the Ivatan, and the Palawan tribes. The Negritos, including the Aetas, and the Ati, are considered as the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines though they are estimated to be around 30,000 people (0.03%).
Other ethnic groups include Chinese, Spaniards, and Americans.
More recent immigrants include British, European, Japanese, Korean, Arab, Asian Indian, Indonesian, and other ethnic groups.
Throughout Philippine history, various people of different races, and nationalities have intermarried with the indigenous Malayo-Polynesian populations. Their descendants are known as mestizos. The official population, and percentage of all types of mixed blood individuals living in the Philippines remain unknown.

Philippine culture is a mixture of Eastern, and Western culture. The Hispanic influences in Philippine culture are derived from the culture of Spain, and Mexico. These Hispanic influences are most evident in literature, folk music, folk dance, language, food, art, and religion.[59] Spanish settlers introduced Iberian-Mexican customs, traditions, and cuisines. Philippine cuisine is a mixture of Asian, and European dishes.
Philippine tradition exhibits festivities known as Barrio fiestas (district festivals) to commemorate their patron saints. One of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of Spanish surnames, and names among Filipinos. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial decree, the Clavería edict, for the systematic distribution of family names, and implementation of the Spanish naming system on the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. A Spanish name, and surname among the majority of Filipinos does not always denote Spanish ancestry.
