From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Latin is an inflected language, and as such has nouns, pronouns, and adjectives that must be declined in order to serve a grammatical function. A set of declined forms of the same word pattern is called a declension. There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and grammatical gender. For simple declension paradigms, visit the Wiktionary appendices: First declension, Second declension, Third declension, Fourth declension, Fifth declension.

[edit] Grammatical cases
A complete Latin noun declension consists of six grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative and vocative. They are abbreviated to the first three letters.
The sequence NOM-VOC-ACC-GEN-DAT-ABL has been the usual order taught in Britain and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Hall Kennedy's Latin Primer (1866). It reflects the tendencies of different cases to share similar endings (see Syncretic trends below). For a discussion of other sequences taught elsewhere, see Instruction in Latin#Order of cases. However, some schools teach it in the order NOM-GEN-DAT-ACC-ABL-VOC, as first given.

[edit] Comparisons to English usage

The nominative case marks the subject of a statement and is used with a copula: "Mary is going to the store" or "Mary is my sister".
The genitive case (also known as the possessive case) expresses possession, measurement, or source. In English, the genitive case is represented analytically by the preposition of or by the enclitic "–'s", which itself developed from the genitive case. This "–'s" closely resembles the Latin third declension's genitive suffix "–is". In Latin, as in English, the genitive singular may be identical to the nominative plural of a noun (apart from the apostrophe in English, which does not change pronunciation): eg, "equi" = "horse's/ horses", insulae = "island's/ islands", etc.
The dative case marks the recipient of an action, the indirect object of a verb. In English, the prepositions to and for tend to denote this case analytically. However, note that in English, the dative may be marked by word order without a preposition; contrast "Give me the book" with "Give the book to me" ("Give to me the book" would be incorrect or at least very unusual).
The accusative case marks the direct object of a verb. In English, except for a small number of words which display a distinct accusative case (e.g., who/whom, I/me, he/him), the accusative and nominative cases are identical.
The ablative case expresses separation, indirection, or the means by which an action is performed. In English, the prepositions by, with, from, in and on are most commonly used to indicate this case.
The vocative case is used to address someone or something in direct speech. In English, this function is expressed by intonation or punctuation: "Mary, are you going to the store?" or "Mary!" ("Mary" is vocative). Historically, English-language noun paradigms translated this case with a prefaced interjection such as "O Mary!"
The locative case expresses the place where or time when an action is performed. The Latin locative case is extremely marginal, applying only to the names of cities and small islands and to a few other isolated words. The Romans considered all islands to be "small" except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Much of the case's function had been absorbed into the ablative. For singular first and second declension, the locative is identical to the genitive singular form, and for the singular third declension, the locative is identical to the ablative singular form. For plural nouns of all declensions, the locative is also identical to the ablative form. The few fourth and fifth declension place-name words would also use the ablative form for locative case. However, there are a few rare nouns that use the locative instead of a preposition: Domus-->Domī (at home), Rūs-->Rūrī (in the country), Humus-->Humī (on the ground), Militia-->Militiae (in military service, in the field), Focus--> Focī (at the hearth; at the center of the community). In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was actually interchangeable between ablative and dative forms, but in the Augustan Period, the use of the ablative form became fixed.


[edit] Syncretic trends
Syncretism, where one form in a paradigm shares the ending of another form in the paradigm, is common in Latin. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:

The vocative is always identical to the nominative in the plural, and in the singular except in the second declension and a few Greek nouns. For example, the vocative of Aeneās is Aenea, although Aeneās is first declension.
The dative is always the same as the ablative in the plural, and in the singular in the second declension, the third-declension full i-stems i.e. neuter i-stems, adjectives), and fourth-declension neuters.
The genitive singular is the same as the nominative plural in first-, second-declension, and fourth declension nouns that are not neuter.
The dative singular is the same as the genitive singular in first- and fifth-declension nouns.
Plural neuter nominative/accusative always ends in -a (with a few exceptions: demonstrative hic and related istic and illic, relative/interrogative quī and friends; in all of them, the neuter plural takes the same form as feminine singular nominative).
The accusative singular ends in short vowel plus -m, except for a few neuters with unusual base forms.
The accusative plural (assuming not neuter) ends in a long vowel plus -s; so does the nominative plural of the third, fourth and fifth declensions (again assuming not neuter).
The locative is identical to the ablative in the fourth and fifth declension.
The locative, ablative, and dative are identical in the plural.


[edit] History of cases
Old Latin had only two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, with a clear similarity to the first and second declensions of Ancient Greek. The other pattern was used by the third declension and was very different from Greek, even for direct cognates. When new words were absorbed into Latin, they were generally placed in the third declension.

[edit] Nouns

[edit] First declension (a)
Nouns of this declension usually end in –a and are typically feminine, e.g. 'road' (via, viae fem.) and 'water' (aqua, aquae fem.). There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g. 'farmer' (agricola, agricolae masc.) and 'sailor' (nauta, nautae masc.).
The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is a. The nominative singular form consists of the stem and the affix -a, and the genitive singular form is the stem plus -ae.

[edit] First declension Greek nouns
The first declension also holds three types of Greek loanwords, derived from Ancient Greek's Alpha Declension. They are declined irregularly in the singular, but are sometimes treated as if they were native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative athlēta instead of the original athlētēs.
For full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix First declension.

[edit] Second declension (o)
The second declension is a large group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine nouns like equus, equī ("horse") and puer, puerī ("boy') and neuter nouns like castellum, castellī ("fort"). There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of gemstones, trees, and some cities.
In the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the stem and the affix -us, although some end in -er, which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending -um. However, every second-declension noun has the affix -ī attached as a suffix to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is o.

[edit] Second declension R nouns
Some masculine nouns of the second declension end in an –er or an –ir in the nominative singular. For such nouns, the genitive singular must be learned to see if the E is dropped. For example, socer, –erī keeps its E. However, the noun magister, –trī ("teacher") drops its E in the genitive singular. Nouns with –ir in the nominative singular never drop the I.
The declension of second declension R nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, with the exception of the vocative singular, which is identical to the nominative rather than ending in an -e.
Some scholars[who?] have hypothesised that neuter nouns originally did not have an official nominative case because (the Proto-Europens believed), as inanimate objects, they did not act. Of course, even an inanimate object may be the subject of a verb (eg, "the war (bellum) began in 1939"), so Latin-speakers simply used the accusative, unchanged.
For declension tables of second declension nouns, see the corresponding Wiktionary appendix.

[edit] Second declension Greek nouns
The second declension contains two types of masculine Greek nouns and one form of neuter Greek noun. These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from Omicron Declension.
Some Greek nouns may be declined as normal, Latin nouns. For example, theātron can appear as theātrum.

[edit] Peculiarities

Nouns ending with –vus, –quus and –vum may be declined in two ways. Their alternate inflections resemble Old Latin.

The Vocative Singular of Deus is also "Deus", instead of substituting an -e for the -us (i.e. "dee") as would normally be expected for a 2nd declension -us noun.


[edit] Third declension (i)
The third declension is the largest group of nouns. These nouns may end in –a,–e, –ī, –ō, –y, –c, –l, –n, –r, –s, –t, or –x . It consists of masculine, neuter, and feminine nouns of variable nominative cases and roots. The third declension includes flumen, fluminis neut. ("river"), flos, floris masc. ("flower"), and pax, pacis fem. ("peace"). Each noun has the affix -is as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. Masculine, feminine and neuter nouns each have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, only masculine nouns end in an –or (amor). Only feminine nouns end in an –īx (phoenīx), and only neuter nouns end in an –us (onus). As in all declensions, some nouns defy these rules.

1 The nominative singular is not regularly the root with a suffix appended. It may be the root; it may be identical to the genitive singular; or it may take a distinct form. The same is true of other forms that are the same as the nominative singular: the vocative singular and the neuter accusative singular.
2 The nominative and accusative of neuter nouns are always identical. It should not be assumed that –en is always the appropriate ending, as it might appear above.

[edit] Third declension i-stem nouns
The third declension also has a set of nouns that are declined differently. They are called i-stems. I-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure I-stems are indicated by the parisyllabic rule or special neuter endings. Mixed I-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule.

Masculine & Feminine

Parisyllabic Rule: Some masculine and feminine third declension i-stem nouns have the same number of syllables in the genitive as they do in the nominative. For example: amnis, –is. The nominative ends in -is.
Double-Consonant Rule: The rest of the masculine and feminine third declension i-stem nouns have two consonants before the –is in the genitive singular. For example: pars, partis


Neuter

Special Neuter Ending: Neuter third declension i-stems have no rule. However, all of them end in –al, –ar or –e. For example: animal, –ālis



Pure I-stems may exhibit peculiar endings in both singular and plural. Mixed I-stems employ normal (consonant) 3rd declension endings in the singular but I-Stem endings in the plural. Note the alternative I-stem endings indicated in parentheses.

1 The nominative singular is not regularly the root with a suffix appended. It may be the root; it may be identical to the genitive singular; or it may take a distinct form. The same is true of other forms that are the same as the nominative singular: the vocative singular and the neuter accusative singular.
The rules for determining I-stems from non-I-stems and "mixed" I-stems should be thought of more as "guidelines" than "rules": even among the Romans themselves, the categorization of a 3rd declension word as an I-stem or non-I-stem was quite fluid. The result is that many words that should be I-stems according to the parisyllabic and consonant stem rules actually are not, such as canis or iuvenis. By the parisyllabic rule, "canis" should be a masculine I-stem and thus differ from the non-I-stems by having an extra -i- in the plural Genitive form: "canium". In reality, the plural Genitive of "canis" is "canum", the form of a non-I-stem. This fluidity even in Roman times results in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin, as scholars were trying to imitate what was fluid to begin with.

[edit] Peculiarities
In the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.

[edit] Fourth declension (u)
The fourth declension is a group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine words like 'wave' (fluctus, fluctūs masc.) and 'port' (portus, portūs masc.) with a few feminine exceptions, including 'hand' (manus, manūs fem.). The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns like 'knee' (genu, genūs neut.). Each noun has the affix -ūs as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is u.

[edit] Fifth declension (e)
The fifth declension is a small group of nouns consisting of mostly feminine words like 'affair, matter, thing' (rēs, reī fem.) and 'day' (diēs, diēī usually feminine, except on notable days when it is masculine). Each noun has either the affix -ēī or –eī as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form.

Note that nouns ending in iēs have long ēī in the dative and genitive, while nouns ending in a consonant + ēs have short eī in these cases.

[edit] Pronouns
Relative and demonstrative pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:

the nominatives are often irregular
the dative singular ends in -ī: rather than -ae or -ō.
the genitive singular ends in -īus rather than -ae or -ī.

These differences identify the "pronominal" declension, and a few adjectives follow this pattern.

[edit] Personal pronouns
The first and second persons are irregular. They may be only masculine or feminine.

[edit] Interrogative pronouns
The interrogative pronouns are used strictly for asking questions. It is best not to confuse them with the relative pronoun and the interrogative adjective (which is declined like the relative pronoun). Interrogative pronouns rarely occur in the plural, though they may. The plural interrogative pronouns are the same as the plural relative pronouns.

[edit] Adjectives

[edit] First and second declension adjectives
First and second declension are inflected in the masculine, the feminine and the neuter; the masculine form typically ends in –us (although some end in -er, see below), the feminine form ends in –a, and the neuter form ends in –um. Therefore, adjectives are given like altus, alta, altum.

[edit] First and second –īus genitive adjectives
Nine first and second declension adjectives are irregular in the genitive and the dative in all genders. They can be remembered by using the mnemonic acronym UNUS NAUTA. They are:
ūllus, –a, –um; any
nūllus, –a, –um; no, none (of any)
uter, –tra, –trum; which (of two)
sōlus, –a, –um; sole, alone
neuter, –tra, –trum; neither (of two)
alius, –a, –ud; (gen. sing. alterīus to avoid aliīus); another
ūnus, –a, –um; one

[edit] Third declension adjectives
Third declension adjectives are normally declined like third declension i-stem nouns, except for the fact they always have a –ī rather than a -e in the ablative singular (unlike i-stem nouns, in which only neuters have –ī). Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending vetus, veteris (old, aged), have an -e in the ablative singular (all genders), a -um in the genitive plural (all genders), and a -a in the nominative and accusative plural (neuter only).

[edit] Third declension adjectives with one ending
Third declension adjectives with one ending have single nominative ending for all genders. Like nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of inflection.

[edit] Third declension adjectives with two endings
Third declension adjectives that have two endings have one form for the masculine and feminine, and a separate form for the neuter. The ending for the masculine and feminine is –is, and the ending for the neuter is –e. Because the sexed form ends in an –is, we find the adjective genitive singular.

[edit] Third declension adjectives with three endings
Third declension adjectives with three endings have three separate nominative forms for all three genders. Like third and second declension –r nouns, the masculine ends in an –er. The feminine ends in an –ris, and the neuter ends in an –re. With that information, we come upon the genitive singular needed for inflection, the feminine form.

[edit] Comparison and superlative forms of adjectives
As in English, adjectives have superlative and comparative forms. For regular first and second declension and third declension nouns with one or two endings, the comparison is formed by adding an –ior for the masculine and feminine, and an –ius for the neuter to the base. The genitive for both are formed by adding an –iōris. Therefore, they are declined like the third declension. However, they are not declined as i-stems are. Superlatives formed by adding an –issimus, –a, –um to the base. Now, we find that superlatives are declined like first and second declension adjectives.

benignus, –a, –um (kind, nice)

[edit] Comparisons and superlatives of –er adjectives
Adjectives (in the third and first and second declensions) that have masculine nominative singular forms ending in –er have different forms. If the feminine and neuter forms drop the E, use that for the comparative form. The superlative is formed by adding an –rimus onto the masculine form.

[edit] Declension of īdem
The adjective īdem, eadem, idem means 'same.' It is a variant of the third person pronouns that were declined earlier. Generally, they are formed by adding –dem to a declined third person pronouns. However, some forms have been changed to ease pronunciation.

[edit] Declension of numerals
See also: Roman numerals for symbology.
There are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are Cardinal numerals, and Ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals such as Distributive numerals and Adverbial numerals

[edit] Cardinal numerals
All numerals, except ūnum (one), duo (two), tria (three), mīlia (thousand, sing. mīlle) and ducentī (two-hundred) are indeclinable adjectives. Ūnus, ūna, ūnum is declined like a first and second declension adjective with an –īus in the genitive, and –ī in the dative. Duo is declined irregularly and tria is declined like a third declension adjective.

Note that to write the phrase "four thousand horses" in Latin, the genitive is used: "quattuor milia equōrum", literally, "four thousands of horses".

As stated before, the rest of the numbers are indeclinable adjectives. They are also indeclinable as substantives.

[edit] Ordinal numerals
Ordinal numerals all decline like normal 1st and 2nd declension adjectives.

Primus = first
Secundus = second
Tertius = third
Vicensimus = twentieth

Note: "Secundus" only means "second" in the sense of "following". The adjective Alter, -ra, -rum meaning "the other (of two)" was more frequently used in many instances that English would use "second".
Ordinal numbers, not Cardinal numbers, are commonly used to represent dates, because they are in the format of "in the tenth year of Caesar", etc. which also carried over into the Anno Domini system and Christian dating, i.e. "anno post Christum nato centensimo" = AD 100.

[edit] Distributive numerals
A rare numeral construction denoting an equal number distributed among several objects, i.e. "how many each?" "two by two". They decline like normal 1st and 2nd declension adjectives, and are logically always plural. Bis, Bina = "twice two". A classical example would be "Uxores habent deni duo deniqui inter se communes" = "groups of ten or twelve men had wives in common" –Gallic Wars, Julius Caesar

[edit] Adverbial numerals
Adverbial numerals are (as the name states) indeclinable adverbs, but because all of the other numeral constructions are adjectives, they are listed here with them. Adverbial numerals give how many times a thing happened. Semel = once, Bis = twice, Ter = thrice (three times), Quater = four times, etc

[edit] Adverbs and their comparisons and superlatives
Adverbs are not declined. However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.

[edit] First and second declension adjectives' adverbs
First and second declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding an –ē onto their bases.


Adjective
Adverb


clārus, –a, –um (clear, famous)
clārē (clearly, famously)


validus, –a, –um (strong, robust)
validē (strongly, robustly)


īnfīrmus, –a, –um (weak)
īnfīrmē (weakly)


solidus, –a, –um (complete, firm)
solidē (completely, firmly)


integer, –gra, –grum (whole, fresh)
integrē (wholly, freshly)


līber, –era, –erum (free)
līberē (freely)



[edit] Third declension adjectives' adverbs
Typically, third declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding an –iter onto their bases. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add an –er to their bases.


Adjective
Adverb


prūdēns, –entis (prudent)
prūdenter (prudently)


audāx, –ācis (bold)
audācter (boldly)


virilis, –e (courageous, spirited)
viriliter (courageously, spiritedly)


salūbris, -e (wholesome)
salūbriter (wholesomely)



[edit] Adverbs' comparative and superlative forms
Adverbs' comparative forms are their neuter adjectives' comparative forms. Adverbs' superlative forms are made in the same way in which first and second declension adjectives' adverbs are made.
First and second declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding an –ē onto their bases.

[edit] Peculiarities within declension

[edit] Irregularity in number
Some nouns are declined in the singular only. This is the case with:

Materials such as aurum (gold) and aes (copper)
Abstract nouns such as celeritās (speed) and scientia (knowledge)
Proper names such as Iulius (Julius) and Clāra (Clara)

There are nouns that are declined only in the plural as well (plurale tantum):

Many festivals, such as Saturnalia
Words like castra (camp) and arma (arms)
A few geographical names are plural such as Thēbae (Thebes).


[edit] Indeclinable nouns
Indeclinable nouns are neuter nouns which occur only in the nominative and the accusative singular. There are only six such nouns:

fās — fate, divine law
īnstar — likeness
māne — morning
nefās — sin, abomination
nihil / nil — nothing, none
secus — sex, coitus


[edit] Heterogeneous nouns
Heterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.

A few nouns in the second declension occur in both the neuter and masculine. However, their meanings remain the same.
Some nouns are one gender in the singular, but become another gender in the plural. They may also change in meaning.

^ Being a Greek word, the accusative form is phoenica (Ovid, Metamorphoses, 15.393[1]).
^ (gen.; nom. and dat. do not occur) the goddess Ops (pers.)
