Lawrence Weiner (born in the Bronx, New York, February 10, 1942) is a central figure of conceptual art, whose work often takes the form of typographic texts. He lives and works in New York and Amsterdam.




[edit] Works
Weiner's early work included experiments with shaped canvas, and cutting out squares from carpeting or walls. In 1968, when Sol LeWitt came up with his Paragraphs on Conceptual Art, Weiner formulated his famous Declaration of Intent (1968):

—1. The artist may construct the piece.
—2. The piece may be fabricated.
—3. The piece need not be built.
—Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.

Weiner created his first book Statements in 1968, a small 64 page paperback with texts describing projects. Published by The Louis Kellner Foundation and Seth Siegelaub, "Statements" is considered one of the seminal conceptual artist's books of the era. He was a contributor to the famous Xeroxbook also published by Seth Siegelaub in 1968. Since the early 1970s, wall installations have been his primary medium, and he has shown at the Leo Castelli gallery. Nevertheless, Weiner works in a wide variety of media, including video, film, books, sound art using audio tape, sculpture, performance art, installation art, and graphic art. In 2007 he participated at the symposium “Personal Structures Time-Space-Existence” a project which was initiated by the artist Rene Rietmeyer.
