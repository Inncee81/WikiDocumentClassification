Wagashi (和菓子 ?) is a traditional Japanese confectionery which is often served with tea, especially the types made of mochi, azuki bean paste, and fruits.
Wagashi is typically made from natural based (mainly plant) ingredients. The names used for wagashi commonly fit a formula—a natural beauty and a word from ancient literature; they are thus often written with hyōgaiji (kanji that are not commonly used or known), and are glossed with furigana.
Generally, confectioneries that were introduced from the West after the Meiji Restoration (1868) are not considered wagashi. Most sorts of Okinawan confectionery and those originating in Europe or China that use ingredients alien to traditional Japanese cuisine, e.g., kasutera, are only rarely referred to as wagashi.

[edit] History



This section requires expansion.



[edit] Ancient




Grave of Emperor Suinin, Nara Prefecture.


In ancient Japan, people ate fruits and nuts as confectionery and sweets, to supplement nutrition in addition to grain, such as rice, wheat and millet. In an excavation of a Jōmon period archeological site, the carbonized remains of what appeared to be baked cookies made from chestnut powder were discovered.
According to the Kojiki, Emperor Suinin ordered Tajima-mori to bring Tokijiku-no-Kagu-no-Konomi (登岐士玖能迦玖能木實 ,a kind of orange?) from the Eternal Land. 10 years later, Tajima-mori returned with the orange, but Emperor Suinin was already dead. Tajima-mori mourned since he could not carry out his mission and took his own life.[1] By tradition, Tajima-mori is worshiped as spirit like a patron saint among confectionery craftsmen.
Grain processing technology evolved through rice cultivation. People began to produce a parched rice (yaigome), sun-dried cooked rice (hoshi-ii), rice flour, dumpling (dango), mochi, ame (made of saccharified rice malt) and so on. Thus, ancient people's confectionery was very simple.

[edit] Tang confectionery
Japan sent envoys to the Sui and Tang Dynasty from the Asuka period to the beginning of the Heian period. They brought back eight Tang confectioneries (唐菓子 ,Tō-gashi or kara-kudamono?) and 14 grain flour-based confectioneries (果餅 ?) and the recipes. The Tang confectioneries were kneaded wheat flour and rice flour, and fried in oil. These were more advanced than the confectionery technology of Japan in those days. They were served at the Imperial Court and offered to Shintoist and Buddhist deities. According to one view, a dark brown sugar was also brought back from China by Jianzhen who came to Japan from the Tang in this period. However, since sugar-refining technology was not introduced to Japan at this point, the sugar was very rare and was treasured like a medicine. Generally, the syrup that resulted from boiling the sap of Grape ivy down (甘葛煎 ,amazura-sen?) was used as a sweetener at this time.
During this period, many diaries and tales were written among upper class and aristocrats. The Tale of Genji, The Pillow Book and The Diary of Izumi Shikibu have some episodes about confectionery. Moreover, the records manifesting a life situation also increased with improvement of a government institution.[clarification needed] They are how we know confectionery culture of those days.

Tang confectioneries

Major eights: Baishi, Danki, Hichira, Kakko, Keishin, Tensei, Tōshi and Tsuishi.
Others: Buto, Fuzuku, Heidan, Hōtō (According to one theory, it is an archetype of Hōtō), Kakunawa, Konton, Magari, Mugikata and Sakuhei.


Aozashi: It is made of parched green wheat flour and twisted like a thread.
Kezurihi: Shaved ice flavored with amazura-sen syrup. It is called kakigori today.
Some mochi-based confectioneries. For example:

Tsubaki mochii: A mochi flavored with amazura-sen syrup.
Inoko mochii: A mochi shaped as a wild boar piglet.




[edit] Introduction of tea
See also: History of tea in Japan
The first introduction of tea in Japan is unclear. In 729, Emperor Shōmu held a ritual of the tea party after sutra recitation. In 815, Emperor Saga was given a cup of tea by the high priest. During the Heian period it seems that the customs of tea drinking had not been established outside of Temples and Buddhism, and had not progressed into domestic culture. Therefore, the standard introduction is in 1191, when the famous Zen priest Eisai brought back tea seeds to Kyoto. Then, confectionery was improved as a snack or a light meal to accompany tea.
In 1349, Rin Jōin (林淨因 ?) who came from Yuan to Japan with a Zen priest. He lived in Nara, and sold a steamed filled dumplings. However, since meat eating was a taboo in Japan then, azuki bean paste sweetened with honeysuckle syrup, was used as a replacement filling. This was very popular and was presented to the Imperial Court repeatedly. Then, Rin married and was naturalized in Japan. The manjū store which he opened is still operating in Tokyo as Shiose Sō-honke (塩瀬総本家 ?). Moreover, from 1949, Rin was worshiped as ancestor of manjū in Hayashi shrine in Nara.

[edit] Nanban confectionery
In 1543, Portuguese were shipwrecked on Tanegashima Isle. Some European confectioneries became popular in Japan during the Nanban trade. These were referred to as nanban-gashi (南蛮菓子 ?), or "Wagashi with a new wind".
In Japan, cattle are not common, therefore non-dairy based confectionery was more popular, in particular castella, kompeito, aruheitō, karumera, keiran sōmen, bōro and bisukauto.

[edit] Edo period
During the Edo period, the production of sugarcane in Okinawa became highly productive, and low quality brown sugar as well as heavily processed white sugar became widely available. A type of sugar, wasanbon was perfected in this period and is still used exclusively to make wagashi. Wagashi was a popular gift between samurai, in significance much like a good wine. Wagashi is served as part of a Japanese tea ceremony, and serving a good seasonal wagashi shows one's educational background.
