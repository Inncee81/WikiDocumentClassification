A facsimile of the Heiligenstadt Testament


The Heiligenstadt Testament is a letter written by Ludwig van Beethoven to his brothers Carl and Johann at Heiligenstadt (today part of Vienna) on 6 October 1802. It reflects his despair over his increasing deafness and his desire to overcome his physical and emotional ailments in order to complete his artistic destiny. Beethoven kept the document hidden among his private papers for the rest of his life, and probably never showed it to anyone. It was discovered in March 1827, after Beethoven's death, by Anton Schindler and Stephan von Breuning, who had it published the following October.
A curiosity of the document is that, while Carl's name appears in the appropriate places, blank spaces are left where Johann's name should appear (as in the upper right corner of the accompanying image). There have been numerous proposed explanations for this, ranging from Beethoven's uncertainty as to whether Johann's full name (Nikolaus Johann) should be used on this quasi-legal document, to his mixed feelings of attachment to his brothers, to transference of his lifelong hatred of the boys' alcoholic, abusive father (ten years dead in 1802), also named Johann.

For my brothers Carl and [Johann] Beethoven
O you men who think or say that I am malevolent, stubborn or misanthropic, how greatly do you wrong me, you do not know the secret
causes of my seeming, from childhood my heart and mind were disposed to the gentle feelings of good will, I was even ever eager to
accomplish great deeds, but reflect now that for six years I have been a hopeless case, aggravated by senseless physicians, cheated
year after year in the hope of improvement, finally compelled to face the prospect of a lasting malady (whose cure will take years
or, perhaps, be impossible), born with an ardent and lively temperament, even susceptible to the diversions of society, I was
compelled early to isolate myself, to live in loneliness, when I at times tried to forget all this, O how harshly was I repulsed by
the doubly sad experience of my bad hearing, and yet it was impossible for me to say to men speak louder, shout, for I am deaf. Ah
how could I possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others, a sense
which I once possessed in highest perfection, a perfection such as few surely in my profession enjoy or have enjoyed - O I cannot
do it, therefore forgive me when you see me draw back when I would gladly mingle with you, my misfortune is doubly painful because
it must lead to my being misunderstood, for me there can be no recreations in society of my fellows, refined intercourse, mutual
exchange of thought, only just as little as the greatest needs command disposition, although I sometimes ran counter to it yielding
to my inclination for society, but what a humiliation when one stood beside me and heard a flute in the distance and I heard
nothing, or someone heard the shepherd singing and again I heard nothing, such incidents brought me to the verge of despair, but
little more and I would have put an end to my life - only art it was that withheld me, ah it seemed impossible to leave the world
until I had produced all that I felt called upon me to produce, and so I endured this wretched existence - truly wretched, an
excitable body which a sudden change can throw from the best into the worst state - Patience - it is said that I must now choose
for my guide, I have done so, I hope my determination will remain firm to endure until it please the inexorable parcae to break the
thread, perhaps I shall get better, perhaps not, I am prepared. Forced already in my 28th year to become a philosopher, O it is not
easy, less easy for the artist than for anyone else - Divine One thou lookest into my inmost soul, thou knowest it, thou knowest
that love of man and desire to do good live therein. O men, when some day you read these words, reflect that you did me wrong and
let the unfortunate one comfort himself and find one of his kind who despite all obstacles of nature yet did all that was in his
power to be accepted among worthy artists and men. You my brothers Carl and [Johann] as soon as I am dead if Dr. Schmid is still
alive ask him in my name to describe my malady and attach this document to the history of my illness so that so far as possible at
least the world may become reconciled with me after my death. At the same time I declare you two to be the heirs to my small
fortune (if so it can be called), divide it fairly, bear with and help each other, what injury you have done me you know was long
ago forgiven. To you brother Carl I give special thanks for the attachment you have displayed towards me of late. It is my wish
that your lives be better and freer from care than I have had, recommend virtue to your children, it alone can give happiness, not
money, I speak from experience, it was virtue that upheld me in misery, to it next to my art I owe the fact that I did not end my
life with suicide. - Farewell and love each other - I thank all my friends, particularly Prince Lichnowsky and Professor Schmid - I
desire that the instruments from Prince L. be preserved by one of you but let no quarrel result from this, so soon as they can
serve you better purpose sell them, how glad will I be if I can still be helpful to you in my grave - with joy I hasten towards
death - if it comes before I shall have had an opportunity to show all my artistic capacities it will still come too early for me
despite my hard fate and I shall probably wish it had come later - but even then I am satisfied, will it not free me from my state
of endless suffering? Come when thou will I shall meet thee bravely. - Farewell and do not wholly forget me when I am dead, I
deserve this of you in having often in life thought of you how to make you happy, be so -


Heiligenstadt
October 6,1802 Ludwig van Beethoven
For my brothers Carl and [Johann]
to be read and executed after my death.
Heiligenstadt, October 10, 1802, thus do I take my farewell of thee - and indeed sadly - yes that beloved hope - which I brought
with me when I came here to be cured at least in a degree - I must wholly abandon, as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered so
hope has been blighted, almost as I came - I go away - even the high courage - which often inspired me in the beautiful days of
summer - has disappeared - O Providence - grant me at least but one day of pure joy - it is so long since real joy echoed in my
heart - O when - O when, O Divine One - shall I find it again in the temple of nature and of men - Never? no - O that would be too
hard.
