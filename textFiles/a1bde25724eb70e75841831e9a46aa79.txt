Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) is a platform-independent, Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based registry for businesses worldwide to list themselves on the Internet. UDDI is an open industry initiative, sponsored by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), enabling businesses to publish service listings and discover each other and define how the services or software applications interact over the Internet. A UDDI business registration consists of three components:

White Pages — address, contact, and known identifiers;
Yellow Pages — industrial categorizations based on standard taxonomies;
Green Pages — technical information about services exposed by the business.

UDDI was originally proposed as a core Web service standard[1]. It is designed to be interrogated by Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages and to provide access to Web Services Description Language (WSDL) documents describing the protocol bindings and message formats required to interact with the web services listed in its directory.
UDDI was written in August, 2000, at a time when the authors had a vision of a world in which consumers of Web Services would be linked up with providers through a public or private dynamic brokerage system. In this vision, anyone needing a service such as credit card authentication would go to their service broker and select one supporting the desired SOAP or other service interface and meeting other criteria. In such a world, the publicly operated UDDI node or broker would be critical for everyone. For the consumer, public or open brokers would only return services listed for public discovery by others, while for a service producer, getting a good placement in the brokerage—by relying on metadata of authoritative index categories—would be critical for effective placement.
The UDDI was integrated into the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) standard as a central pillar of web services infrastructure. By the end of 2005, it was on the agenda for use by more than seventy percent of the Fortune 500 companies in either a public or private implementation[citation needed]. Many of these enterprises subscribe to some form of service-oriented architecture (SOA), server programs or database software licensed by some of the professed founders of the UDDI.org and OASIS.
The UDDI specifications supported a publicly accessible Universal Business Registry in which a naming system was built around the UDDI-driven service broker. IBM, Microsoft and SAP announced they were closing their public UDDI nodes in January 2006.[2]
Some assert[citation needed] that the most common place that a UDDI system can be found is inside a company where it is used to dynamically bind client systems to implementations. They would say that much of the search metadata permitted in UDDI is not used for this relatively simple role. However, the core of the trade infrastructure under UDDI, when deployed in the Universal Business Registries (now being disabled), has made all the information available to any client application, regardless of heterogeneous computing domains.

[edit] UDDI Nodes & Registry
UDDI nodes are servers which support the UDDI specification and belong to a UDDI registry while UDDI registries are collections of one or more nodes.
SOAP is an XML-based protocol to exchange messages between a requester and a provider of a Web Service. The provider publishes the WSDL to UDDI and the requester can join to it using SOAP.
