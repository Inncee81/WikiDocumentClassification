For other uses, see Ping (disambiguation).
Ping is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network; it is also used to self test the network interface card of the computer, or as a speed test. It works by sending ICMP “echo request” packets to the target host and listening for ICMP “echo response” replies. Ping measures the round-trip time[1] and records any packet loss, and prints when finished a statistical summary of the echo response packets received, the minimum, mean, max and in some versions the standard deviation of the round trip time.
The word ping is also frequently used as a verb or noun, where it is usually incorrectly used to refer to the round-trip time, or measuring the round-trip time.

[edit] History




A server denying a ping request because of the request's size.


Mike Muuss wrote the program in December, 1983, as a tool to troubleshoot odd behavior on an IP network. He named it after the pulses of sound made by a sonar, since its operation is analogous to active sonar in submarines, in which an operator issues a pulse of energy at the target, which then bounces from the target and is received by the operator. (The pulse of energy in sonar is analogous to a network packet in ping). [1][2]
The usefulness of ping in assisting the "diagnosis" of Internet connectivity issues was impaired from late in 2003, when a number of Internet Service Providers began filtering out ICMP Type 8 (echo request) messages at their network boundaries.
This was partly due to the increasing use of ping for target reconnaissance, for example by Internet worms such as Welchia that flood the Internet with ping requests in order to locate new hosts to infect. Not only did the availability of ping responses leak information to an attacker, it added to the overall load on networks, causing problems for routers across the Internet.
Although RFC 1122 prescribes that any host must accept an echo-request and issue an echo-reply in return, this is supposedly a security risk. Thus, hosts that no longer follow this standard are frequent on the public Internet.

[edit] Sample pinging

[edit] Sample with Linux
The following is a sample output of pinging en.wikipedia.org under Linux with the iputils version of ping:

admin@localhost# ping en.wikipedia.org
PING rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org (66.230.200.100) 56(84) bytes of data.

64 bytes from rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org (66.230.200.100): icmp_seq=6 ttl=52 time=97.6 ms

--- rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss, time 8998ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 78.162/89.213/97.695/6.836 ms

This output shows that en.wikipedia.org is a DNS CNAME record for rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org which then resolves to 66.230.200.100.
The output then shows the results of making 10 pings to 66.230.200.100 with the results summarized at the end. (To stop the program in Linux or Windows, press Ctrl+C.)

shortest round trip time was 78.162 milliseconds
average round trip time was 89.213 milliseconds
maximum round trip time was 97.695 milliseconds
Standard deviation of the round-trip time was 6.836 milliseconds

While a ping session is running, under some Linux systems, you can get the overall status of the session without quitting by sending the Ctrl+\ key combination. This will give you a summary similar to the following.

6/6 packets, 0% loss, min/avg/ewma/max = 15.304/23.188/20.446/53.673 ms


[edit] Sample with Windows
The following is a sample output of pinging en.wikipedia.org under Windows (Windows 7 used in the following example) from within the Command Prompt:

Pinging rr.pmtpa.wikimedia.org [208.80.152.2] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 208.80.152.2: bytes=32 time=80ms TTL=53
Reply from 208.80.152.2: bytes=32 time=81ms TTL=53
Reply from 208.80.152.2: bytes=32 time=84ms TTL=53
Reply from 208.80.152.2: bytes=32 time=84ms TTL=53

Ping statistics for 208.80.152.2:
   Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
   Minimum = 80ms, Maximum = 84ms, Average = 82ms

Windows appears not to inform the user about duplicated return packets.
While a ping session is running you can get the overall status of the session without quitting by sending the Ctrl+Break key combination.

[edit] Sample with Mac OS X
The following is a sample output of pinging en.wikipedia.org under Mac OS X Leopard using the Terminal:

Macintosh:~ user$ ping -c 10 en.wikipedia.org

10 packets transmitted, 10 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 40.019/45.575/50.851/3.588 ms

While a ping session is running you can get the overall status of the session without quitting by sending the Ctrl+t key combination. This will give you a summary similar to the following.

load: 0.37  cmd: ping 1748 running 0.01u 0.07s
255/255 packets received (100%) 18.827 min / 19.975 avg / 29.200 max


[edit] Message format

[edit] Echo request
The echo request is an ICMP message whose data is expected to be received back in an echo reply ("pong"). The host must respond to all echo requests with an echo reply containing the exact data received in the request message.

Type = 8
Code = 0
Header Checksum


Identifier
Sequence Number


Data :::



Type must be set to 8.
Code must be set to 0.
The Identifier and Sequence Number can be used by the client to match the reply with the request that caused the reply. In practice, most Linux systems use a unique identifier for every ping process, and sequence number is an increasing number within that process. Windows uses a fixed identifier, which varies between Windows versions, and a sequence number that is only reset at boot time.
The data received by the Echo Request must be entirely included in the Echo Reply.


[edit] Echo reply
The echo reply is an ICMP message generated in response to an echo request, and is mandatory for all hosts and routers.

The data received in the echo request must be entirely included in the echo reply.


[edit] Payload
The payload of the packet is generally filled with letters of the alphabet as this ASCII tcpdump shows

[edit] In gaming
Main article: ping (video games)
In network multiplayer games like Armagetron Advanced,Left 4 Dead, Unreal Tournament, Quake, Battlefield, Call of Duty, Counter Strike, Combat Arms, Halo,Gunz etc., the server notes the time it requires for a game packet to reach a client and a response to be received. This round-trip time is usually reported as the player's 'ping'. It is used as an effective measurement of the player's lag, with lower ping times being desirable. Note that this style of ping typically does not use ICMP packets.

[edit] In common usage
The term 'ping' is commonly used to indicate an effectively contentless message. For instance, a short or empty instant message, email, voice mail or "missed call" notification can be used to indicate availability, or anything else that can be conveyed with a single bit of information at a given time.
