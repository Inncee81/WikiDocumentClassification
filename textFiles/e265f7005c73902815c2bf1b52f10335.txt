For the country, see Slovakia.
SVK (also written svk) is a decentralized version control system written in Perl, with a hierarchical distributed design comparable to centralized deployment of BitKeeper and GNU arch. The primary author of svk is Kao Chia-liang (Chinese: 高嘉良). Like Perl, it is distributed under the Artistic License and the GNU General Public License, making svk free software.
On June 5, 2006, Chia-liang Kao joined Best Practical, makers of Request Tracker (and also heavy users of SVK), and SVK became a Best Practical product [1] [2].

[edit] Features
SVK uses the Subversion filesystem but provides additional features:

Offline operations like checkin, log, merge.
Distributed branches.
Lightweight checkout copy management (no .svn directories).
Advanced merge algorithms, like star-merge and cherry picking.
Changeset signing and verification.
Can mirror and operate on Subversion, Perforce and CVS repositories.
