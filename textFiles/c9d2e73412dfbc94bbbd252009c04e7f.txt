A digital audio editor is a computer application for audio editing, i.e. manipulating digital audio. Digital audio editors are the main software component of a digital audio workstation.

[edit] For use with music
Editors designed for use with music typically allow the user to do the following:

Record audio from one or more inputs and store recordings in the computer's memory as digital audio


Edit the start time, stop time, and duration of any sound on the audio timeline


Fade into or out of a clip (e.g. an S-fade out during applause after a performance), or between clips (e.g. crossfading between takes)


Mix multiple sound sources/tracks, combine them at various volume levels and pan from channel to channel to one or more output tracks


Apply simple or advanced effects or filters, including compression, expansion, flanging, reverb, audio noise reduction and equalization to change the audio


Playback sound (often after being mixed) that can be sent to one or more outputs, such as speakers, additional processors, or a recording medium


Conversion between different audio file formats, or between different sound quality levels

Typically these tasks can be performed in a manner that is both non-linear and non-destructive.

[edit] For use with speech
Editors designed for use in speech research add the ability to make measurements and perform acoustic analyses such as extracting and displaying a fundamental frequency contour or spectrogram. They typically lack most or all of the effects of interest to musicians.
