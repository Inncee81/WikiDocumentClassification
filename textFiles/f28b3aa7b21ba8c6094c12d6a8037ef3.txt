Adele debuted at number one with her Mercury Prize-nominated debut album 19 on the UK album chart; the album has since been certified platinum with sales of more than 500,000 copies in the UK and over 1,200,000 worldwide.[6] After the album peaked at #54 on the Billboard 200 chart on 8 July, 2008 (and #36 on the magazine's "Top Heatseekers" chart)[7] Adele performed before more than 17 million television viewers on Saturday Night Live, leading to a very strong showing on a couple of notable download charts, and leading the album to leap from #46 to #11 on the official chart.
In 2009, Adele won two Grammy Awards, Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the single "Chasing Pavements". The week after the Grammy Awards aired, the album rose to a new peak of #10 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 61,000 copies[8] while her single "Chasing Pavements" hit a new peak at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100.[9]

[edit] Life and career
Adele began singing at age 4,[10] when she became obsessed with voices, an obsession that is ongoing.[11] Adele impersonated the Spice Girls at dinner parties. As a preteen she sang Destiny's Child songs at her mostly black school.[12] To make her look like the singer, her mother made an eye patch with sequins, which she said was embarrassing.[13] Adele went through a phase where she wore Slipknot clothing and a studded dog collar.[14] Adele then claimed she was influenced by the music of Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald in her teens by accident, as she stumbled on the artists' CDs on a local HMV store while looking for a new hairstyle. She only got to listen to those songs for the first time as she was clearing her room.[15] She graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, which was the same performing arts school attended by Amy Winehouse, Katie Melua, Leona Lewis, Imogen Heap and Kate Nash.[15][16] Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent.[5] A month later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com.[17] Since then Adele has played in small UK gigs, and has toured with best friend Jack Peñate, as well as Jamie T, Raul Midon, Devendra Banhart, Amos Lee, Keren Ann and the band Exist. Adele went on her first UK headlining tour in October 2007.

[edit] Career

[edit] Rise to popularity
Adele wrote her first record Hometown Glory when she was 16 years old.[18] In the song she sings the praises of Tottenham.[citation needed] The song was released on 22 October 2007 as a limited edition 7" vinyl on Jamie T's label Pacemaker Recordings, with "Best for Last" as its B-side.[citation needed] Since launching her MySpace page on Christmas Eve 2004, Adele became popular on the site which she used as a media focus and test point for songs.[citation needed] She then signed to independent music label XL Recordings, which in January 2008 released her second single Chasing Pavements.[19]
During her teenage years she recorded a demo and gave it to her friend, Lyndon. He eventually put it on MySpace and it became very successful there. Adele got a record deal through MySpace. When she got a phone call, she could not believe it was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records.[20] When a friend told her that it was a real record company, she signed.[20]
She then signed to independent music label, XL Recordings. In January 2008, Adele released her second single, "Chasing Pavements", hitting #2 for four weeks in the UK Chart and remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after release.[21]

[edit] Saturday Night Live appearance
By October 2008, her attempt to break America seemed to have failed,[32][33] so Adele sang on SNL. On the 18 October she was the musical guest with guest host Josh Brolin. The episode had also been hotly anticipated because of an appearance by US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Adele performed "Chasing Pavements" and "Cold Shoulder".[34] This appearance has been credited with a sharp rise in her popularity in the United States. The day following her appearance, 19 topped the iTunes charts and ranked #5 on Amazon.com, while "Chasing Pavements" rose into the Top 25.[35] 19 was still at the #2 position on iTunes on 22 October.

[edit] Vogue spread
A photo spread shot by Annie Leibovitz appeared in the April 2009 edition of Vogue Magazine. The magazine printed a feature story in which Adele discussed her fashion preferences.[59]

[edit] Critical acclaim
At the 51st Grammy Awards held on 8 February, 2009 Adele won awards in the categories of Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance[60] Adele was also nominated for Grammy Awards in the categories of Record of the Year and Song of the Year.[61] While winning a Grammy Award would be important to Adele she feels that Grammys should not be awarded to musicians that have released only one album. Adele said "I cannot see how this album life span could get any better and I do not feel like it needs to be. I'm already over the moon and blown away with people's response to it".[62] Later in her blog clarifying what she claims is a misinterpretation by the BBC she wrote "of course I want to win one !!" and "to win a grammy you must give a performance of your life. And I find it hard to think of my album like that! I cannot be like 'yeah I so deserve it', that would make me sound like a prick!". Adele has noticed that that British press have found the remarks ungrateful while Americans tend to think they were gracious.[63] As of 11 March the Grammy's Awards had not been delivered to Adele. As per English tradition Adele plans to store the Awards on a cabinet or shelf in her bathroom.[64]
On 10 December, 2007 Adele was awarded with the first Brit Awards Critics' Choice Award[65][66] and was nominated for a 2008 Mercury Prize award for 19.[67] She also won an Urban Music Award for "Best Jazz Act".[68]Her video for "Chasing Pavements" received an MTV Video Awards nomination in the category of Best Choreography[69] as well as a 2008 Q Awards nomination in the category of Breakthrough Act[70] and Music of Black Origin nomination in the category of Best UK Female.[71] In early 2008 Adele topped in a poll of music critics Adele topped BBC's new music talent list, which was compiled from the votes of 150 music critics.[39]
Adele was nominated for three 2009 Brit Awards in the categories of Best British female,Best British single, and Best British breakthrough act.[72]
She also received praises from Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, who said it was "refreshing to hear something different" after a thousand years of "identikit bands who want to sound like The Libertines".[73] Her music was described by the Richmond Times Dispatch music critic as "a perfect backdrop to a lazy afternoon in the coffee shop".[32]
The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an "essential" Blue Eyed Soul recording.[3]
Adele cherishes the praise she has received from Kanye West and Beyoncé.[5]
Adele agrees with critics that have suggested that her vocals are more developed and intriguing than her songwriting.[74]

[edit] Comparison with contemporaries and other female vocalists from the UK
Adele's success is occurring simultaneously with several other British female soul singers. The British press has dubbed her a new Amy Winehouse. Also she has been linked to a third British Musical Invasion of the United States. Adele commented that while this phenomenon is unexpected she is "proud to be a part of it. I'm very pleased to be riding the wave". In December she said that Duffy was The Sound of 2008 and called the comparisons with other females lazy noting "we're a gender, not a genre".[75][5][32] Adele comparing herself to Amy Winehouse and Duffy said "I think Amy is hardcore," "I think Duffy is really soft – she's got the pin-up look going on. She's a proper lady. I think I'm really contemporary. And I'm just really mouthy!"[76]
By the beginning of 2009 listeners and critics started to describe Adele as unique. AllMusic wrote that "Adele is simply too magical to compare her to anyone".[18]

[edit] Lyrical meaning
The album was written about a former boyfriend. The song "Chasing Pavements" refers to an incident that occurred after she was thrown out of a pub for punching the former boyfriend in the face after she discovered him cheating on her. As she was running down the street she thought to herself "What you're doing is you're chasing an empty pavement." According to Adele "I sang it into my phone, went home and got three chords together."[77]

[edit] Future plans
Singer Laura White has confirmed that Adele will duet with her at Adele's suggestion.[78]
Adele would like to collaborate in the future with younger singers more than established ones. She also would like to complete a duet she started with Will Young.".[79]
In January 2009 described her lyrics as "better, they're sharp and they're witty now".[18]

[edit] Second album
As of March 2009 Adele had written six songs for her second album and has tentatively scheduled recording for later in 2009. Adele was still working on what the album will sound like. The singer said "I know who I'm working with and duets and stuff and I'm not trying to be secretive. But I do not want to say in case it does not work out".[80]

[edit] Personal life
As of November 2008 Adele had just moved to Notting Hill after leaving her mother's house, a move that prompted her to give up drinking. According to the singer her heavy drinking “was clouding my judgment and making me make all the wrong decisions in my personal life. You want a beer to relax after a show then that turns into nine". Adele claims she has never used drugs and vows never to do so in the future.[81]
Adele claims to be a UK dress size 14-16. She was quoted as saying "I'm really mouthy about not having the Hollywood look. Everyone asks me 'Why do you not feel pressured to get the Hollywood look?' and I'm like, "Because I do not." "I mean, I quite like my eyes and my lips. I do not like my double chin or my gut, but I do not not like them enough to do something about it".[82]
Adele has said she is fearful that her personal life may hurt her future music plans.[83]
In July 2008, Adele paid £8,000 in a charity auction in aid of Keep a Child Alive for a commissioned painting by Stella Vine. Adele said she planned to ask Vine to paint a portrait of "my mum and me". The money raised helps children and their families with HIV/AIDS in Africa.[84]
