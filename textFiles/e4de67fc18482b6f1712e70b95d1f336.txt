Flag of the Fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques.


Vexillology is the scholarly study of flags. The word is a synthesis of the Latin word vexillum and the suffix -logy, meaning "study of". The vexillum was a particular type of flag used by Roman legions during the classical era; its name is a diminutive form of the word vela meaning sail, and thus literally means "little sail". Unlike most modern flags, which are suspended from a pole or mast along a vertical side, the square vexillum was suspended from a horizontal crossbar along its top side, which was attached to a spear.
The term was coined in 1957 by the American scholar Whitney Smith[citation needed], the author of many books and articles on the subject. It was originally considered a sub-discipline of heraldry, and is still occasionally seen as such. It is sometimes considered a branch of semiotics. [1] It is formally defined in the FIAV (Fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques) constitution as "the creation and development of a body of knowledge about flags of all types, their forms and functions, and of scientific theories and principles based on that knowledge." A person who studies flags is a vexillologist, and a person who designs flags is a vexillographer.
Every second year FIAV organizes the International Congress of Vexillology (ICV). The 2007 ICV was in Berlin, Germany; the 2009 ICV will be in Yokohama, Japan. Internet activity of vexillologists is centered on the Flags of the World website and mailing list.

[edit] Flag Identification Symbols (FIS)
The Flag Identification System was created by Whitney Smith and adopted by FIAV.
The first row represents use on land and the second use on water, each divided into private (civil), government (state), and military (war) use.


Usage
Private Use
Government Use
Military Use


Land Use
Civil Flag
State Flag
War Flag


Sea Use
Civil Ensign
State Ensign
War Ensign


There are 63 representing symbols that can describe the flag, including:


FIS
Text mode
Description
Usage



C**/***
Civil Flag
by private persons on land



*S*/***
State Flag
by state institutions on land



**W/***
War Flag
by military on land (army)



***/C**
Civil Ensign
on private vessels (merchant ensign)



***/*S*
State Ensign
on state owned vessels



***/**W
War Ensign
by navy



CS*/***
Civil and State Flag
by private persons and state on land



*SW/***
State and War Flag
by state services and military on land



CSW/***
National Flag
for all purposes on land



***/CSW
National Ensign
for all purposes on vessels



CSW/CSW
National Flag and Ensign
for all purposes on land and sea


Other symbols are used to describe other aspects of the usage of the flag, such as official status and which side of the flag is being shown. The ones in general use are:

 Normal or de jure version of flag, or obverse side
 Design proposed but not officially adopted
 Design is a reconstruction based on observations
 Reverse side of flag
 Design is an acceptable variant
 Alternative version of flag
 De facto version of flag
 Flag has different designs on its obverse side and its reverse side
 Obverse side meant to be hoisted with pole to the observer's right
 Design officially authorized to represent nation by government of that nation
 Design used in the past, but now abandoned (not part of Smith's original set)
 Reverse side is mirror image of obverse side
 Reverse side is congruent with obverse side
 Information on reverse side is not available
 Flag can be hung vertically by hoisting on a normal pole, then turning the pole 90°
 Flag can be hung vertically by rotating the design first
 Vertical hoist method of flag is unknown
 Design has no element that can be rotated
 Flag can be hoisted vertically only


[edit] Principles of flag design
Flag designs exhibit a number of regularities, arising from a variety of practical concerns, historical circumstances, and cultural prescriptions that have shaped and continue to shape their evolution.
First among the practical issues confronting a vexillographer is the necessity for the design to be manufactured (and often mass produced) into or onto a piece of cloth, which will subsequently be hoisted aloft in the outdoors to represent an organization, individual or idea. In this respect, flag design departs considerably from logo design: logos are predominantly still images to be read off a page, screen, or billboard, while flags are alternately draped and fluttering images to be seen from a variety of distances and angles. The prevalence of simple bold colors and shapes in flag design attests to these practical issues.
Flag design is also a historical process in which current designs often refer back to previous designs, effectively quoting, elaborating, or commenting upon them. Families of current flags may derive from a few common ancestors as in the cases of the Pan-African colours, the Pan-Arab colors, the Pan-Slavic colours, the Nordic Cross and the Ottoman flag.
Certain cultures prescribe the proper design of flags, through heraldic or other authoritative systems. Prescription may be based on religious principles: see, for example, Islamic flags. As a discipline, vexillology is beginning to promote design principles based on a body of research on flag history and design. Prominent examples are Ted Kaye's five Good Flag, Bad Flag principles published and endorsed by the North American Vexillological Association:

Keep It Simple: the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
Use Meaningful Symbolism: the flag’s images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes.
Use 2–3 Basic Colors: limit the number of colors on the flag to three, which contrast well and come from the standard color set.
No Lettering or Seals: never use writing of any kind or an organization’s seal.
Be Distinctive or Be Related: avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections.
