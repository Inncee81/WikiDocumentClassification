[edit] Production

[edit] Conception
Matthew Weiner wrote the pilot of Mad Men in 2000 as a spec script when he was working as a staff writer for Becker.[2][3] Television producer David Chase recruited Weiner to work as a writer on his HBO series The Sopranos after reading the pilot script in 2002.[2][4] "It was lively, and it had something new to say," Chase said. "Here was someone [Weiner] who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism."[4] Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years – during which time neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project[2][3]—until The Sopranos was completing its final season and cable network AMC happened to be in the market for new programming.[4] "The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series," according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll (Carroll misspoke: AMC's first original series was the comedy-drama "Remember WENN", which ran from 1996 to 1998) "and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal."[2] According to the first episode, the phrase "Mad Men" was a slang term coined in the fifties for advertisers working on Madison Avenue (by advertisers working on Madison Avenue).

[edit] Filming and production design
With the exception of the pilot episode, shot at Silvercup Studios in New York City, Mad Men is filmed at Los Angeles Center Studios.[5] It has been converted to high definition for showing on AMC-HD and on video-on-demand services available from various cable affiliates.[6] The writers, including Weiner, amassed volumes of research on the period in which Mad Men takes place so as to make all aspects of the series — including detailed set designs, costume design, and props — historically accurate,[3][4][7] producing an authentic visual style that garnered critical praise.[8][9][10] Each episode has a budget between $2-2.5 million, though the pilot episode's budget was over $3 million.[2][3] On the copious scenes featuring smoking, Weiner stated that "Doing this show without smoking would've been a joke. It would've been sanitary and it would've been phony."[7] Since the actors cannot, by law, smoke tobacco cigarettes in their workplace, they instead smoke herbal cigarettes.[2][7] In a nod to New York City, Robert Morse was cast in the role of senior partner Bertram Cooper. In the 1960s, Morse starred in A Guide for the Married Man (1967), a source of inspiration for Weiner,[4] and How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying (1961) — two Broadway plays about amoral New Yorkers.
Weiner collaborated with cinematographer Phil Abraham and production designers Robert Shaw (who worked on the pilot only) and Dan Bishop to develop a visual style that was "influenced more by cinema than television."[5] Alan Taylor, a veteran director of The Sopranos, directed the pilot and also helped establish the series' visual tone.[11] To convey an "air of mystery" around Don Draper, Alan tended to shoot from behind him or would frame him partially obscured. Many scenes set at Sterling Cooper were shot lower-than-eyeline to incorporate the ceilings into the composition of frame; this reflects the photography, graphic design and architecture of the period. Alan felt that neither steadicam nor handheld camera work would be appropriate to the "visual grammar of that time, and that aesthetic didn’t mesh with [their] classic approach" — accordingly, the sets were designed to be practical for dolly work.[5]

[edit] Episode format
The opening title sequence features credits superimposed over a graphic animation of a business man falling from a height, surrounded by skyscrapers with reflections of period advertising posters and billboards, accompanied by a short edit of the instrumental "A Beautiful Mine" by RJD2. The business man appears as a black and white silhouette. The titles pay homage to graphic designer Saul Bass's skyscraper filled opening titles for Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) and falling man movie poster for Vertigo (1958) – Weiner has listed Hitchcock as a major influence on the visual style of the series.[7] At their end, episodes either fade to black or smash cut to black as period music or a theme by series composer David Carbonara plays during the ending credits.

[edit] Crew
Aside from having created the series, Matthew Weiner is the show runner, head writer, and the sole executive producer; he contributes to each episode – writing or co-writing the scripts, casting various roles, and approving costume and set designs.[2][3] He is notorious for being highly selective about all aspects of the series, and promotes a high level of secrecy around production details.[2][3] Tom Palmer served as a co-executive producer and writer on the first season. Scott Hornbacher, Todd London, Lisa Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, and Maria Jacquemetton were producers on the first season. Palmer, Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, and Maria Jacquemetton were also writers on the first season. Bridget Bedard, Chris Provenzano, and writer's assistant Robin Veith complete the first season writing team.
Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, and Maria Jacquemetton returned as supervising producers for the second season. Veith also returned and was promoted to staff writer. Hornbacher replaced Palmer as co-executive producer for the second season. Consulting producers David Isaacs, Marti Noxon, Rick Cleveland, and Jane Anderson joined the crew for the second season. Tim Hunter, Alan Taylor, Andrew Bernstein, and Lesli Linka Glatter are regular directors for the series.

[edit] Characters
Main article: List of characters in Mad Men
Mad Men features an ensemble cast representing several segments of society in 1960s New York, although it focuses more on Don Draper. Mad Men places emphasis on showing each character's past and their development over time. The following character summaries were based on information gathered from the page 'About the show' at amctv.com[12].

[edit] Lead characters

Don Draper (born in 1925 as Richard "Dick" Whitman) (Jon Hamm): Creative director and eventual junior partner of Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency; Draper is the series' protagonist. His past is shadowy, but he has achieved success and attained a reputation due to his insight into the consumer's mind. He is married to Elizabeth "Betty" Draper, with two children, but is not satisfied with married life and embarks on several affairs. Draper has a complicated personal life, on which Hamm commented: "He has a marriage he’s not that involved in, kids he’s not that involved in, a brother he wasn’t involved with at all. He tries to make amends a day late and a dollar short. That’s his great tragedy."[2] "[H]e wants to be a different kind of person than he is."[13] Don's early life was tragic. He was the offspring of a lady with a shady past and a simple man. He was taken in by the man's legitimate wife and raised out of obligation. His life with this family was one without love or direction. When he was serving in the Korean War, as Dick Whitman, he volunteered for a risky assignment because he felt there was little to lose in terms of his personal life, family, and future. It was in one of these assignments that he met the real Donald Draper. During an explosion accidentally caused by Whitman, the real Don Draper was killed. Dick takes advantage of Don's death by switching dogtags thus faking his own death and assuming Don's identity.
Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss): She began as the ostensibly naïve "new girl" at Sterling Cooper. Starting as Draper's unassuming new secretary, Peggy showed a talent in advertising strikingly similar to Draper's own. A few months after being hired, she was promoted to junior copywriter and eventually received her own office (albeit one that she shared with the floor's Xerox machine). During her first week at work, in March 1960, on the advice of Joan, Peggy decides to take birth control pills even though we assume she is a virgin. Later that night, a drunk Pete Campbell stops by her apartment and sleeps with her, even though he is to marry Trudy that weekend. A few months later, Peggy sleeps with Pete again, this time on his office couch. During the first season finale, Peggy has a horrible stomach ache which she thinks is attributed to bad office food and goes to the hospital. Instead, the doctor informs a shocked Peggy that she is in labor. This results in the birth of their son in late December 1960. Sometime during the second season, the boy is given up for adoption. During second season flashbacks, we see Draper visit Peggy in the mental ward. Peggy does not inform Pete about the birth of their child until two years later, and her "time away from work" remains a mystery to most of the Sterling Cooper staff. Pete believes she went to a "fat farm" because she returns to the office much slimmer. After Freddy Rumsen's departure, Peggy is promoted to copywriter, taking over Freddy's accounts and eventually moving into Freddy's old office. When Pete confesses his love for Peggy, she informs him of the child he fathered with her and that she subsequently "gave away".
Peter "Pete" Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious junior account executive. Campbell comes from an old-monied Manhattan family that, while as of late has run into financial difficulties, remains socially influential. Pete lived a life of privilege prior to joining Sterling Cooper. He appears to have been something of a cad at first, and sexually pursues Peggy despite his pending marriage to Trudy; he eventually settles down. He tries to blackmail Don Draper with information on the latter's past; the attempt backfires, but Campbell remains in good standing at Sterling Cooper. Though failing the attempt to father a child with Trudy because of her infertility (and briefly considering adoption), at the end of Season Two (late 2008) it appears that he is unaware that Peggy had his child.
Elizabeth "Betty" Draper (January Jones): Don Draper's wife and mother of their two children, Sally and Bobby. Prior to marrying Don, Betty had been a professional model. However, she has since become, on the surface, the very model of a 1950s homemaker, staying at home and minding the children while Don goes to work and comes back at odd hours. In the first season, her relationship with Don is rather distant, manifesting itself in tremors and other psychosomatic disturbances that eventually cause Don to set up sessions for her with a therapist. In season two, Betty takes up horseback riding and frequently clashes with Don over matters of parenting. When she discovers his affair, she tells him not to come home. Following a brief separation, Betty allows Don to return home after discovering she is pregnant with their third child, but not before picking up an anonymous man in a bar and having sex with him on a couch in the bar's office. Jones described her character as "lost [...] She’s supposed to be this perfect Grace Kelly wife of a businessman, and it’s just not going the way she imagined."[2]
Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks): An office manager at Sterling Cooper. She is also the head of the secretarial pool, and acts as a professional and social mentor to the office's secretaries. Joan embodies the voluptuous role of femme fatale. She had a long-term affair with Roger Sterling until his two heart attacks caused him to abandon his adulterous behavior. Joan recognizes that she lives in a man's world, and accepts her socially prescribed role as a woman within such a world. Joan briefly assisted Harry Crane when he needed help with proofing TV scripts, a role which she relished but one that her jealous and controlling fiancé opposed. Harry eventually hired a man to read the scripts, a move that greatly disappointed Joan but one that she, as a woman in a man's world, did not oppose. Joan's relationship with her doctor fiancé is frequently punctuated by ugly and sometimes violent sexually possessive moments.
Roger Sterling (John Slattery): One of the two senior partners of Sterling Cooper, and a good friend of Don Draper. His father founded the firm with Bertram Cooper, which explains why his name is before Cooper's. A picture in Cooper's office shows Roger as a child alongside Cooper depicted as a young adult. In the same scene, Cooper refers to the picture calling Roger, "Peanut", indicating that theirs is a friendship (perhaps even family relationship) that spans many decades. Roger was a notorious womanizer until two heart attacks changed his perspective for a while. The heart attacks did not affect his drinking habits, which remained excessive. He retains considerable affection from both Sterling Cooper employees (with whom he has far more contact than Bert Cooper) and his family. By 1962, Sterling has returned to work and is seen to indulge in his old habits. He has left his wife, Mona, for Don's former secretary, the 20-year old Jane.


[edit] Supporting characters

Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis): A creative copywriter, the somewhat pompous and bourgeois pipe-smoking Paul prides himself on his socially progressive views. Some time prior to season one, he had had a relationship with Joan Holloway which ended poorly because Paul spoke too much about their relationship. Paul tried unsuccessfully to date Peggy soon after she was hired by Sterling Cooper. Through most of the second season, Paul dated Sheila White, an African-American woman from South Orange, New Jersey. They broke up while in Oxford, Mississippi where they had gone as Freedom Riders to oppose segregation in the South. Kinsey lives in the low income southern section of New Jersey suburb of Montclair.
Ken Cosgrove (Aaron Staton): The young account executive originating from Vermont. Outside the office, Ken is an aspiring author having had a short story published in the Atlantic Monthly, a fact which is the source of some envy from his co-workers, particularly the competitive Pete Campbell. According to his bio in the Atlantic Monthly, Ken attended Columbia University. He continues to write outside of work, the results of which have yet to be seen. He has one fan, Salvatore, who secretly has a crush on the handsome account exec.
Harry Crane (Rich Sommer): A media buyer recently appointed the head of Sterling Cooper's newly formed television department (which originally consisted solely of Harry until he expanded the department by one script reviewer in season two). Although Harry joins his colleagues in drinking and flirtations, he is a dedicated husband and soon to be father. However, he did have a one night stand with a secretary in season one which led to his being briefly kicked out of his home by his wife. Harry's wife has been instrumental in motivating her husband to be more ambitious at work.
Salvatore Romano (Bryan Batt): The Italian-American art director at Sterling Cooper. Sal is the only "ethnic" in a high-level position at the agency, and is also a closeted gay man. Fearful of acting upon his homosexuality, he avoided at least one sexual encounter with another man. By 1962, Sal had married a woman, Kitty, who seems unaware of Sal's sexual orientation, yet is nonetheless starting to realize that her husband does not love her. The issue of being closeted for Sal is shown in brief but stark contrast against the newly evolving social attitudes toward homosexuality. Sal's secret crush on Ken Cosgrove comes uncomfortably and awkwardly close to being revealed during a dinner in Sal's apartment. Later, when a recently hired young advertising exec, Kurt, publicly announces his homosexuality, Sal remains painfully silent while his fellow co-workers speak disparagingly about Kurt.
Bertram Cooper (Robert Morse): The somewhat eccentric senior partner at Sterling Cooper. He has a behind-the-scenes, hands-off approach to business, leaving day-to-day affairs to Sterling and Draper. Like many of his executives, Bertram is a Republican, and also an admirer of the ideas of Ayn Rand. He is also fascinated by Japanese culture, especially Japanese art. He has a Mark Rothko painting hanging in his office. Bert refuses to let anyone wear shoes in his office. Bert's sister also owns a controlling share in Sterling Cooper.
Herman "Duck" Phillips (Mark Moses): Director of Account Services at Sterling Cooper. He had previously worked at the London office of Young & Rubicam, a larger agency, but an undisclosed fiasco caused him to leave. A tough, driven executive, he often clashes with Don Draper. Duck is an alcoholic and was recently divorced. He is the father of two children. Duck has recently engineered the sale of Sterling Cooper to a British agency that was seeking a foothold in America. As a reward for his role in the sale, Duck was to have been promoted to company president under the new Sterling Cooper, which is now a free-standing division under the British agency, but Don's opposition, and Duck's failure to realize that Don wasn't bound by a contract, left that promotion highly in doubt in the season 2 finale.
Freddy Rumsen (Joel Murray) was a copywriter at Sterling Cooper. He was the first in the office to notice Peggy Olsen's talent for copywriting while working on an ad campaign for Belle Jolie. Since that time, he has been supportive of Olsen's copywriting efforts. Freddie also displays a talent for playing Mozart on the zipper of his pants. After a petit mal seizure caused Freddy to lose control of his bladder immediately prior to an important client pitch, he was considered a liability to the agency. Roger Sterling asked Freddy to take a paid six month leave of absence, with the implicit understanding that Freddy would not be returning to Sterling Cooper.
Francine Hanson (Anne Dudek): One of Betty Draper’s closest friends and neighbors. She spends much time with Betty, gossiping about other neighbors. She becomes furious upon discovering her husband Carlton's infidelity, but she and her husband remain together.
Trudy Campbell (Alison Brie): Pete Campbell's upscale East Side wife. She is unaware of her husband's early infidelity with Peggy prior to their marriage. Trudy wants to be a mother but has so far been unable to conceive despite seeing fertility experts. Her attempts at adopting a child have been angrily refused by Pete, whose upper class family frowns on bringing an unrelated outsider as heir to the family name. Trudy's parents live in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where Trudy retreated to without Pete during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff): The Jewish head of a department store who becomes romantically involved with Draper after she comes to Sterling Cooper in search of an advertising agency to revamp her business' image. She is one of the kinder and more thoughtful people in Draper's world; their relationship becomes physically and emotionally close for a time, as he is able to tell her things he could never share with Midge Daniels or with his wife. When Don is blackmailed by Pete Campbell, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children, and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he didn't want to run away with her, he just wanted to run away. She calls him a coward. Their friendship seems to collapse from that point on. Meeting her in season 2 while out to eat with Bobbie Barrett, the wife of a comedian the firm is using to advertise potato chips, the show reveals that Rachel has gotten married in the interim, going from Miss Menken to Mrs. Katz.
Father John Gill (Colin Hanks): A young Roman Catholic priest visiting at the parish Peggy's family attends in Brooklyn. He tries to keep Peggy in contact with the parish while also employing her advertising skills for the benefit of the Church. He appears to represent a more Modernist and less traditional clergyman than the parish has experienced previously. He has been very pointed in trying to persuade Peggy to make amends for the child she had illegitimately. Peggy's polite attempts to deflect Father Gill's meddling have so far been to no avail.
Anna Draper (Melinda Page Hamilton): The widow of the true Don Draper who spent years tracking down her missing "living" husband only to find out that her husband had been killed in action during the Korean War and that Dick Whitman had assumed his identity to escape further combat. She has become a close confidante of Dick Whitman, who as "Don Draper," continues to support Anna with restitution money for the loss of her husband and for allowing him to keep the identity he adopted. She also divorced the present-day "Don" to allow him to marry Betty. Anna lives in California where she teaches piano. She is a polio survivor who walks with a limp.

Wikiquote has a collection of quotations related to: Mad men



[edit] Themes
Mad Men depicts parts of American society and culture of the early 1960s, highlighting cigarette smoking, drinking, sexism, adultery, homophobia, antisemitism, and ethnic and racial bias as examples of how that era was so much different than the present.[7][14] Smoking, far more common in 1960's United States than it is now, is featured throughout the series; almost every character can be seen smoking multiple times in the course of an episode.[7] In the pilot, representatives of Lucky Strike cigarettes come to Sterling Cooper looking for a new advertising campaign in the wake of a Reader's Digest report that smoking will lead to various health issues including lung cancer.[15] The show presents a subculture in which men who are engaged or married frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. The series also observes advertising as a corporate outlet for creativity for mainstream, middle-class, young, white men. The main character, Don Draper, observes at one point about Sterling-Cooper, "This place has more failed artists and intellectuals than the Third Reich."[16] Along with each of these examples, however, there are hints of the future and the radical changes of the later 1960s; Betty's anxiety, the Beats that Draper discovers through Midge, even talk about how smoking is bad for health (usually dismissed or ignored). Characters also see stirrings of change in the ad industry itself, with the Volkswagen Beetle's "Think Small" ad campaign mentioned and dismissed by many at Sterling Cooper, although Don Draper brilliantly spots the nostalgic value and market potential of renaming the Kodak 'wheel' slide projector as the Kodak Carousel.
Nostalgia. It’s delicate, but potent… Teddy told me that in Greek, nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound. It’s a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone. This device… isn’t a spaceship, it’s a time machine. It goes backwards, forwards. It takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It’s not called the Wheel. It’s called the Carousel. It lets us travel the way a child travels. Around and around and back home again, to a place where we know we are loved. ["Mad Men" Season 1, Episode 13, "The Wheel"]
As well as nostalgia for a previous era, alienation, social mobility and rootlessness unpin the thematic tone of the show. Often these references are completely contemporary, and rooted in American culture of the early 60s, but they have also struck a chord with audiences nearly 50 years later. Evidence of this is Don Draper's rendition of 'Mayakovsky' from Meditations in Time of an Emergency by Frank O'Hara at the end of Episode 1, Season Two which, after broadcast, led the poet's work to re-enter the top 50 sales on Amazon for the first time. [17]

[edit] Reception

[edit] Ratings
"The second season finale [...] posted significantly higher numbers than the series' first season finale, and was up 20% over the season two average. 1.75 million viewers watched Sunday night's season finale, according to fast national data from Nielsen Media Research. The cumulative audience for the three airings of the episode Sunday night (at 9pm, 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.) was 2.9 million viewers."[18]
In Greece, the series premiere scored a 5.4% rating and 5.0 at the 15-44 demographic. The second episode scored a 5.0% rating and a 5.0 rating at the 15-44 demographic. These ratings are the best thus far for a foreign series on Alter Channel. The third episode scored a 3.7% and a 3.9 for the 15-44 demographic.[citation needed]

[edit] Critical reaction
Mad Men has received highly positive critical response since its premiere. Viewership for the premiere at 10 p.m. on July 19, 2007, was higher than any other AMC original series to date.[19] A New York Times reviewer called the series groundbreaking for "luxuriating in the not-so-distant past."[14] The San Francisco Chronicle called Mad Men "stylized, visually arresting […] an adult drama of introspection and the inconvenience of modernity in a man's world".[8] A Chicago Sun-Times reviewer described the series as an "unsentimental portrayal of complicated 'whole people' who act with the more decent 1960 manners America has lost, while also playing grab-ass and crassly defaming subordinates."[20] The reaction at Entertainment Weekly was similar, noting how in the period in which Mad Men takes place, "play is part of work, sexual banter isn't yet harassment, and America is free of self-doubt, guilt, and countercultural confusion."[21] The Los Angeles Times said that the show had found "a strange and lovely space between nostalgia and political correctness".[17] The show also received critical praise for its historical accuracy – mainly its depictions of gender and racial bias, sexual dynamics in the workplace, and the high prevalence of smoking and drinking.[22][4][17][23] The Washington Post agreed with most other reviews in regard to Mad Men's visual style, but disliked what was referred to as "lethargic" pacing of the storylines.[24]
The American Film Institute selected it as one of the 10 best television series of 2007,[25] and it was named the best television show of that year by the Television Critics Association[26] and several national publications, including the Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, TIME Magazine, and TV Guide.[27]
On June 20, 2007, a consumer activist group called Commercial Alert filed a complaint with the United States Distilled Spirits Council alleging that Mad Men sponsor Jack Daniel's whiskey was violating liquor advertising standards since the show features "depictions of overt sexual activity" as well as irresponsible intoxication.[28] Jack Daniel's was mentioned by name in the fifth episode.
Among people who worked in advertising during the 1960s, opinions on the realism of Mad Men differ to some extent. Jerry Della Femina, who worked as a copywriter in that era and later founded his own agency, said that the show "accurately reflects what went on. The smoking, the prejudice and the bigotry."[2] Robert Levinson, one of Weiner's advertising consultants, who worked at BBDO from 1960 to 1980, concurred with Femina: "What [Matthew Weiner] captured was so real. The drinking was commonplace, the smoking was constant, the relationships between the executives and the secretaries was exactly right."[2] However, Allen Rosenshine, a copywriter who went on to lead BBDO, called the show "a total fabrication," saying, "if anybody talked to women the way these goons do, they’d have been out on their ass."[29]

[edit] Marketing
In promotion for the series, AMC aired multiple commercials and a behind the scenes documentary on the making of Mad Men before its premiere. The commercials, as well as the documentary, featured the song "You Know I'm No Good" by Amy Winehouse.[7] The documentary, in addition to trailers and sneak peeks of upcoming episodes, were released on the official AMC website. Mad Men was also made available at the iTunes Store on July 20, 2007, along with the "making of" documentary.[37]
For the second season, AMC undertook the largest marketing campaign it had ever launched, intending to reflect the "cinematic quality" of the series.[38] The Grand Central Station subway shuttle to Times Square was decorated with life-size posters of Jon Hamm as Don Draper, and quotes from the first season.[38] Inside Grand Central, flash mobs dressed in period clothing would hand out "Sterling Cooper" business cards to promote the July 27 season premiere.[38] Window displays were arranged at 14 Bloomingdale's stores for exhibition throughout July, and a 45' by 100' wallscape was posted at the corner of Hollywood and Highland in downtown Hollywood.[38] Television commercials on various cable and local networks, full-page print ads, and a 30-second trailer in Landmark Theaters throughout July were also run in promotion of the series.[38]
Inspired by the iconic Zippo brand, the DVD box set of the first season of Mad Men was designed like a flip-open Zippo lighter. Zippo subsequently developed two designs of lighters with "Mad Men" logos to be sold at the company headquarters and online.[39] The DVD box set, as well as a high definition Blu-ray disc set, was released July 1, 2008; it features a total of 23 audio commentaries on the season's 13 episodes from various members of the cast and crew.[40]

[edit] Product placement
Mad Men integrates product placement into its narratives. For instance, in a second season episode, the beer manufacturer Heineken is seen as a client seeking to bring their beer to the attention of American consumers. This placement was paid for by Heineken as an additional part of their advertising on the show. Cadillac has a similar deal with Mad Men. Other examples remain less obvious, like ads worked on by the firm, or companies sought as clients such as Utz potato chips, Maidenform, American Airlines, Clearasil and others.[41]
