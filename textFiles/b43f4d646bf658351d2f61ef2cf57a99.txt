Mythbuntu is a specialized operating system based on Ubuntu and MythTV (currently 0.21) Following the principles of KnoppMyth and Mythdora, Mythbuntu is designed to simplify the installation of MythTV on a home theater PC. Mythbuntu can be used to install a stand alone frontend, backend, or combination of the two. Mythbuntu aims to keep close ties with Ubuntu thus allowing changes to be moved upstream for the greater benefit of the Ubuntu Community.[citation needed] Due to the close link with Ubuntu, easy conversions between desktop and standalone Mythbuntu installations are possible. The development cycle of Mythbuntu closely follows that of Ubuntu, releases occurring every six months, approximately two weeks after Ubuntu releases.[1]

[edit] Desktop
Mythbuntu uses the Xfce desktop interface by default, but allows for the installation of the default desktop interfaces from Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and Xubuntu. The user can install ubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop, or xubuntu-desktop through the Mythbuntu Control Centre, allowing users to get the default interfaces from Ubuntu.

The Control Centre of Mythbuntu


The Mythbuntu Control Centre provides a GUI used to configure the system. From here you can select what kind of system (Backend, Frontend, Both) you wish to have installed. As previously mentioned you can change the desktop installed along with installing Plugins for mythtv, configuring MySQL, setting passwords, installing proprietary drivers and codecs. Configuration of remote controls, and a range of other utilities and small programs are performed all from this one convenient program.

[edit] Different Applications of Mythbuntu

[edit] Complete Installation (Front-end and Back-end)
Mythbuntu can be used to install a full MythTV client and server system; in simple terms this means that the front-end is stored on the same device as the backend. The front-end is the software required for the visual elements (or the GUI) and is utilised by the common user to find, play and manipulate media files etc. The backend is the server where the media files are actually stored. A full frontend and backend system may have an advantage in that it has 'portability', i.e. it is a standalone device that is not dependent on a separate server (like a gaming console for example).

[edit] Front-end only installations
Alternatively Mythbuntu can be used to install a MythTV client, front-end only system. For example, users may have a central storage device (server) in their house, the server can then be accessed from numerous other devices throughout the house, these other devices needing only a front-end installation on devices containing minimal hardware. Mythbuntu can also run directly from a CD-ROM (i.e. without installation) providing that there is a network connection to a PC with a 'complete installation' (a MythTV back-end server).
Using a 'server' separate from one or more front-end units has the obvious advantages of multiple simultaneous access to shared media files. The server used would generally have hardware of a relatively high specification and would be kept outside of the main living room. An advantage of keeping the server PC outside the living room is that the cooling fan required to accommodate a 'fast' processor can be quite noisy (as can certain hard drives), it can be expensive to invest in fanless/heat sinking equipment to avoid such noise problems.

[edit] Adding Mythbuntu to Ubuntu
Mythbuntu is an Ubuntu derivative that offers an easy single click conversion from Ubuntu to Mythbuntu.[citation needed] still? This means a user no longer needs to type in command line, which can be daunting to new users, or hunt for packages in the various package managers. Rather they can simply visit the website, and click an image to install all necessary packages.
