Double-Entry Bookkeeping is a system that ensures the integrity of the financial values recorded in a financial accounting system. It does this by ensuring that each individual transaction is recorded in at least two different (sections) nominal ledgers of the financial accounting system and so implementing a double checking system for every transaction. It does this by first identifying values as either a Debit or a Credit value. A Debit value will always be recorded on the debit side (left hand side) of a nominal ledger account and the credit value will be recorded on the credit side (right hand side) of a nominal ledger account. A nominal ledger has both a Debit (left) side and a Credit (right) side. If the values on the debit side are greater than the value of the the credit side of the nominal ledger then that nominal ledger is said to have a debit balance.
Each transaction must be recorded on the Debit side of one nominal ledger and that same transaction and value is also recorded on the Credit side of another nominal ledger hence the expression Double-Entry (entered in two locations) one debit and one credit. This ensures that when the nominal ledgers (sometimes known as accounts) are placed in a list which has two columns, the left column for listing nominal ledgers with Debit balances and the right column for ledgers with Credit balances, then the total of all the Debit values will equal the total of all the Credit balances. If this does not happen that may mean that one of the transactions was not recorded twice, i.e. once as a debit and once as a credit as required in the double-entry bookkeeping system.
An example of an entry being recorded twice i.e. double entered (ignore any purchases taxes such as GST,VAT etc.) is when lets say on 1st January a supplier's invoice for stationery costing €100 is recorded and analysed. The expense or Debit entry is Stationery Nominal Ledger a/c €100 Dr and the Credit entry it to the Supplier's Control Nominal Ledger a/c €100 Cr. This transaction has now been recorded twice in the financial accounting system and the total value is €100 for both Debit and Credit values.
Double entry is only used within the nominal ledgers. It is not used within the recording of the daybooks. The information from the daybooks themselves will be taken and used within the nominal ledger and it is the nominal ledgers that will ensure the integrity of the resulting financial information created from the daybooks.
The double entry system uses nominal ledger accounts. From these nominal ledger accounts a Trial balance can be created. The trial balance lists all the nominal ledger account balances sequentially. The list is spilt into two columns, with debit balances placed in the left hand column and credit balances placed in the right hand column. Another column will contain the name of the nominal ledger account describing what each value is for. The total of the debit column must equal the total of the credit column.
From the Trial balance the Profit and Loss Statement and the Balance Sheet can then be produced. The Profit and Loss statement will contain nominal ledger accounts that are Income or Expense type nominal ledger accounts. The Balance Sheet will contain nominal ledger accounts that are Asset or Liability accounts.

[edit] History
The origins of a primitive double-entry system has been traced as far back as the Republican Rome (although some consider the Greek merchants to have used a rudimentary version of this system), in ""ex Oratione Ciceronis pro Roscio Comaedo", and Naturalis Historiae Plinii, lib. 2, cap. 7 where the advised system was "That the one side of their booke was used for Debitor, the other for Creditor" (Huic Omnia Expensa. Huic Omnia Feruntur accepta et in tota Ratione mortalium sola. Utramque Paginam facit.). Later we have traces of it in the 12th century to accounting in the Islamic world.[1] Some sources suggest that Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici introduced this method for the Medici bank in the 13th century. The earliest extant records that follow the modern double-entry form are those of Amatino Manucci, a Florentine merchant at the end of the 13th century.[2] By the end of the 15th century, the merchant venturers of Venice used this system widely. Luca Pacioli, a monk and collaborator of Leonardo da Vinci, first codified the system in a mathematics textbook of 1494.[3] Pacioli is often called the "father of accounting" because he was the first to publish a detailed description of the double-entry system, thus enabling others to study and use it.[4] [5]
In Japan, double-entry bookkeeping was introduced during the Meiji period in the 1870s. The newly-established Japan Mint was the earliest Japanese government institution to begin using double-entry bookkeeping in its Osaka headquarters.

[edit] Bookkeeping process
In the normal course of business, a document is produced each time a transaction occurs. Sales and purchases usually have invoices or receipts. Deposit slips are produced when lodgements (deposits) are made to a bank account. Cheques are written to pay money out of the account. Bookkeeping involves recording the details of all of these source documents into multi-column journals (also known as a books of first entry or daybooks). For example, all credit sales are recorded in the Sales Journal, all Cash Payments are recorded in the Cash Payments Journal. Columns in the journal normally correspond to an account. In the single entry system, each transaction is recorded only once. Most individuals who balance their cheque-book each month are using such a system, and most personal finance software follows this approach.
After a certain period, typically a month, the columns in each journal are each totalled to give a summary for the period. Using the rules of double entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the ledger, or book of accounts. The process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called posting. Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the "T" format undergo balancing, which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.
To quickly check that the posting process was done correctly, a working document called an unadjusted trial balance is created. In its simplest form, this is a three column list. The first column contains the names of those accounts in the ledger which have a non-zero balance. If an account has a debit balance, the balance amount is copied into column two (the debit column). If an account has a credit balance, the amount is copied into column three (the credit column). The debit column is then totaled and then the credit column is totaled. The two totals must agree - this agreement is not by chance - because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is a posting, the debits of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If the two totals do not agree, an error has been made in either the journals or made during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified and the totals of debit column and credit column re-calculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.
Once there are no errors, the accountant produces a number of adjustments and changes the balance amounts of some of the accounts. For example, the "Inventory" account asset account is changed to bring them into line with the actual numbers counted during a stock take. At the same time, the expense account associated with usage of inventory is adjusted. Other adjustments such as posting depreciation and prepayments are also done at this time. This results in a listing called the adjusted trial balance. It is the accounts in this list and their corresponding debit or credit balances that are used to prepare the financial statements.
Finally financial statements are drawn from the trial balance, which may include:

the income statement, also known as a statement of financial results, profit and loss account, or P&L
the balance sheet
the cash flow statement
the statement of retained earnings, also known as the statement of total recognised gains and losses or statement of changes in equity


[edit] Classification of accounts
Items in accounts are classified into five broad groups, also known as the elements of the accounts:[6] Asset, Liability, Equity, Revenue, Expense.

[edit] Abbreviations used in bookkeeping

A/C - Account
A/R - Accounts Receivable
B/S - Balance Sheet
c/d - Carried down
b/d - Brought down
c/f - Carried forward
b/f - Brought forward
Dr - Debit record
Cr - Credit record
G/L - General Ledger; (or N/L - Nominal Ledger)
P&L - Profit & Loss; (or I/S - Income Statement)
PP&E - Property, Plant and Equipment
TB - Trial Balance
VAT - Value Added Tax


[edit] Debits and credits
Main article: debits and credits
Double-entry bookkeeping is governed by the accounting equation. If revenue equals expenses, the following (basic) equation must be true:

assets = liabilities + equity

At any point in time, revenue might not actually be equal to expenses. If so, the equation can be further expanded, so that the (extended) equation becomes:

assets = liabilities + equity + (revenue − expenses)

or

assets = liabilities + (capital − drawings) + (revenue − expenses)


A = L + C − D + R − E

Finally, the equation may be rearranged algebraically as follows:

A + E + D = L + R + C

This equation must be true, for any time period. If it is, then the accounts are said to be in balance. If the accounts are not in balance, an error has occurred.
For the accounts to remain in balance, a change in one account must be matched with a change in another account. These changes are made by debits and credits to the accounts. Note that the usage of these terms in accounting is not identical to their everyday usage. Whether one uses a debit or credit to increase or decrease an account depends on the normal balance of the account. Assets, Expenses, and Drawings accounts (on the left side of the equation) have a normal balance of debit. Liability, Revenue, and Capital accounts (on the right side of the equation) have a normal balance of credit. On a general ledger, debits are recorded on the left side and credits on the right side for each account. Since the accounts must always balance, for each transaction there will be a debit made to one or several accounts and a credit made to one or several accounts. The sum of all debits made in any transaction must equal the sum of all credits made. After a series of transactions, therefore, the sum of all the accounts with a debit balance will equal the sum of all the accounts with a credit balance.
Debits and credits are then defined as follows:

debit: A debit is recorded on the left hand side of a T account
credit: A credit balance is recorded on the right hand side of a 'T' account
Debit accounts = Asset and Expenses (also debit money received into bank accounts)
Credit accounts = Gains (income) and Liabilities (also credit money paid out of bank accounts)

The following accounts have a normal balance of debit:

Assets
Accounts receivable: debts promised by other entities but not yet paid
Drawings by the owners on equity
Expenses

The following accounts have a normal balance of credit:

Liabilities
Accounts payable and taxes, notes or loans payable: debts promised to outsiders but not yet paid
Revenue
Capital

Credit and debit items are summarized at the end of a recording period in a trial balance which is a list of all the debit and credit balances. The trial balance acts as a self checking mechanism for the correctness of entries in the individual accounts and also as a starting point for the preparation of the Final Account which is made up of the balance sheet and the trading, profit and loss account.

[edit] Examples of debits and credits
Purchase of a Computer

Debit Computer account (Fixed asset account) is increased.
Credit Creditors account (Liability account) is increased.

Paying supplier for the computer

Debit Creditors account (Liability account) is reduced.
Credit Bank account (Asset account) is reduced.


The following table summarizes how debits and credits affect the different elements of the accounts.

The customers ledger cards shows the breakdown of how the trade debtors control a/c is made up. The trade debtors control a/c is the total of outstanding debtors and the customer ledger cards shows the amount due for each individual customer. The total of each individual customer account added together should equal the total in the trade debtors control a/c.
The supplier ledger cards shows the breakdown of how the trade creditors control a/c is made up. The trade creditors control a/c is the total of outstanding creditors and the suppliers ledger cards shows the amount due for each individual supplier. The total of each individual supplier account added together should equal the total in the trade creditors control a/c.
Each Bank a/c shows all the money in and out through a bank. If you have more than one bank account for your company you will have to maintain separate bank account ledger in order to complete bank reconciliation statements and be able to see how much is left in each account.

The individual supplier accounts are not to be listed in the trial balance, as the Trade creditors control a/c is the summary of each individual supplier a/c.
Important note: this example is designed to show double entry. There are methods of creating a trial balance that significantly reduce the time it takes to record entries in the general ledger and trial balance.

[edit] Example 2

[edit] Transactions
XYZ Company is closing its books for the end of the month. Each of the daily journals has been summarized and the amounts are ready to be transferred to the general ledger. The amounts to be transferred are:

Purchase raw materials on trade credit: $500,000
Pay workers from cash in bank to make goods: $1,500,000
Pay sales force from cash in bank to sell goods: $1,000,000
Sell goods for cash: $3,500,000

To close the books for the month, we will adjust expenses and revenue to zero by appropriately crediting and debiting the income summary and then closing the income summary to retained earnings (part of equity).
These items are entered in the ledger below; each matching credit and debit have been numbered to make finding them in the ledger easier.

The amount in equity (in the form of retained earnings) has changed with a net credit of $500,000. Since equity has a normal balance of credit, this means there is now $500,000 more in equity than at the beginning of the month.
