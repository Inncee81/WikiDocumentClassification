Henry Winkler, as Fonzie, preparing to jump over a shark while on water skis, in a scene in the Happy Days installment "Hollywood, Part Three of Three."


Jumping the shark is a colloquialism coined by Jon Hein and used by TV critics and fans to denote that point in a TV show or movie series' history where the plot veers off into absurd story lines or out-of-the-ordinary characterizations, particularly for a show with falling ratings apparently becoming more desperate to draw viewers in. In the process of undergoing these changes, the TV or movie series loses its original appeal. Shows that have "jumped the shark" are typically deemed to have passed their peak.

[edit] Origin
The phrase refers to a scene in a three-part episode of the American TV series Happy Days, first broadcast on September 20, 1977. In the third of the three parts of the "Hollywood" episode, Fonzie (Henry Winkler), wearing swim trunks and his trademark leather jacket, jumps over a penned-in shark while water skiing. This was particularly ironic, in that Fonzie, famous for being a biker, had previously jumped his motorcycle for a publicity stunt—but was severely injured in the process, and very remorseful for his actions; he then learned a valuable lesson, and delivered a moral message, that taking foolish risks "isn't cool" (a clearly role-model message against popular 1970s trends of youths imitating daredevil stuntmen like Evel Knievel or Ernie Devlin). In contrast, Fonzie's later decision to take an even greater risk on water skis "to prove a point" came across as absurd in many ways (particularly since the "motorcycle jump" episode was a major point in Fonzie's character development).
Even before "jumping the shark" was employed as a pop culture term, the episode in question was cited many times as an example of what can happen to otherwise high-quality shows when they stay on the air too long in the face of waning interest—or when they simply cease to maintain quality standards for writing or acting, resorting to cheap sensationalism. The infamous scene was seen by many as betraying Happy Days' 1950s setting and its earlier character development by cashing in on the 1970s fads of Evel Knievel[1] and Jaws. Producer Garry Marshall later admitted that he knew the show had lost something as the crew prepared to shoot the scene. As Marshall pointed out in the reunion special that aired on February 3, 2005, however, Happy Days went on to produce approximately 100 more episodes. During the same special, in response to an audience member's question, Marshall introduced the notorious clip and noted how the show had inspired the term.
The first public use[2] of the phrase as a direct metaphor is reported to have been on December 24, 1997, when the jumptheshark.com website was launched by Jon Hein. According to the site, the phrase was coined by Hein's college roommate, Sean J. Connolly, in 1985. The term first appeared in print in the April 9, 1998, Los Angeles Times Calendar Weekend section. The site was sold to Gemstar (owners of TV Guide) on June 20, 2006[1] in 2006 for "over $1 million"[5]. Some Howard Stern staff have speculated that the site sold closer to $5-$10 million, however.[6]

[edit] Controversy
Because the original JumptheShark.com website was famous as an unfiltered listing of honest, diverse and intelligent opinions by ordinary individual viewers and critics, some claimed that TV Guide purchased it in order to "silence" public discussion and criticism of television shows, and replace the site's public-forum content with its own trademark "tabloid-gossip" style of simple glib praise, promotion and hype of mediocre television. The new site no longer permits public input of opinions, but rather simply presents sensationalized feature-discussions of television-show plots, actors, and various other show-trivia by TV Guide writers. Fans of the original site were also outraged over the fact that the site's many years of public contribution and content of various television programs, were purchased so that they could be entirely erased and destroyed by TV Guide, thereby further supressing public discussion and criticism of television. While the site and its content were indeed privately owned by Jon Hein, many nevertheless claimed TV Guide's takeover and deletion to be a form of "corporate censorship" against the Public Domain, reminescent of book-burning.

[edit] Other uses of the term
The use of the term has also been shown on the Internet to criticize musical artists of all styles. The musicthatjumpedtheshark.com website used to quote Wikipedia about the term. The site was interactive, with users furthering the public use of the term inside the world of music via forums and blogs of the subject. The phrase has been used more recently outside the realm of popular culture, representing anything that has reached its peak and has declined in quality. If one thinks a stock or a sports team or a subcultural phenomenon has reached its peak, for example, one can say that it has "jumped the shark." The phrase can also be used more specifically, when referring to a particular event that demonstrates this decline beyond all doubt, such as whenever an entertainment company or business makes a grave mistake, and therefore rapidly loses ratings or fans, becomes bankrupt or is sold. For example: Has GM "jumped the shark"?

[edit] Common methods
The now defunct "Jump the Shark" web site listed 18 categories fans used to tag shows, signifying the moment at which the show jumped. The categories included:

Same Character, Different Actor, generally caused by the departure of an unsatisfied or problematic actor, while the writers attempt to retain the character by simply casting a different actor (generally taken as a show of disrespect for the audience[who?], who has long-identified the character with the original actor).
They did it, in which two main characters have sex, particularly if their sexual tension was deemed part of the show's appeal.
Inane plot devices, appealing to the lowest common denominator, often revolving around lowbrow humor such as the act of flatulence.
Exit...Stage Left, when a (usually popular) cast member or character quits or retires.
_ Gets Canned, when a (usually popular) cast member or character gets fired.
Moving the main characters from their familiar surroundings to a new setting, such as a new home or even a new town.
Special guest star
A very special …: the very special episode, describing a situation comedy episode that either deals with a serious or controversial social issue or is unusually dramatic in some way (a notorious attempt to boost failing ratings with cheap appeals to emotion, but which ultimately destroys the levity of the series).
New kid in town, or Cousin Oliver Syndrome (in reference to the character on The Brady Bunch), when a new character (often, a young child) is added to the cast, in response to former child actors who have entered adolescence or adulthood, and/or to revive falling ratings.
Birth, when a new baby is added to a show's cast (and often unnaturally aged to a preschooler the season following the birth), sometimes to accommodate an actress's real-life pregnancy but usually for the same reasons a New kid in town might otherwise be brought in.
Death, when a cast member dies (in real life), particularly if the individual was a popular or important part of the show.
Another category, entitled simply Ted McGinley, usually includes any show that has featured McGinley in the cast. He has joined the casts of several popular shows after their zenith (The Love Boat, Happy Days, Dynasty, ...), leading to the title as the "Patron Saint of Shark Jumping" (also as the "Grim Reaper of Television"). Other shows, on which McGinley appeared from the start, have in most instances been critically panned and/or canceled quickly.
