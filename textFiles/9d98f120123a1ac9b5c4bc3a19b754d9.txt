[edit] Major parties

Democratic Party (1828 modern, 1792 historic)
Republican Party (1854)


[edit] Other parties in contention for presidential electoral college majority


This is an incomplete list, which may never be able to satisfy certain standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with sourced additions.


In order for a party's nominee to have the possibility of becoming president by majority vote of the electoral college (as opposed to by decision of the United States House of Representatives after an electoral majority has failed to be reached), they must be on the ballot in states whose collective electoral vote total is at least half of the Electoral-College votes. In addition to the two main parties listed above, three additional parties met this criterion in the 2008 Presidential Election.

Libertarian Party (1971)
Constitution Party (1992)
Green Party (1996)


[edit] Other parties that have nominated candidates in recent elections
These parties have offered candidates in recent elections, but did not in 2004, and they did not have ballot status in enough states in 2008 to win the presidency by majority of the electoral college. Some do not have presidential candidates, and only field candidates for Congressional and/or state-level offices.


This is an incomplete list, which may never be able to satisfy certain standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with sourced additions.

[edit] Other parties that have not nominated candidates in recent elections
