Ana Mendieta (18 November 1948 – 8 September 1985) was a Cuban-American artist famous for her performance art and "earth-body" sculptural, photographic, and video work.
Mendieta was born in Havana, Cuba but moved to the United States at a young age. In 1961, at the age of 13, she and her older sister Raquelin were exiled from Cuba because her family opposed the revolutionary government. They were placed in several institutions and foster care in Iowa through Operation Peter Pan run by Catholic Charities with the collaboration of the US government.
She earned a BA from the University of Iowa in 1969 and subsequently earned an MA in Painting and an MFA in the Intermedia Program, founded by artist Hans Breder. Throughout the course of her career, she created work in Cuba, Mexico, Italy, and the United States of America.
Much of Mendieta's work may be considered strongly feminist by some, it is in essence autobiographical. One theme in her early performance art was violence against the female body. Later Mendieta focused on a spiritual and physical connection with the land, most particularly in her Silueta pieces, which typically involved carving her imprint into sand or mud, making body prints or painting her outline or silhouette onto a wall. In 1983 she won the Prix de Rome and took up residence in Rome, Italy. During the last 2 years of her life she started creating "objects", mostly permanent sculptures and drawings, it was her intention to retain the connection with nature via the vibrations of the natural elements she continued to use in the works.
She died on 8 September 1985 in New York from a fall from a 34th floor apartment in Greenwich Village. Eight months earlier Mendieta had married the minimalist sculptor Carl Andre. Andre was tried and acquitted of her murder; during the trial his lawyer described her death as a possible accident or a suicide.
Her estate is managed by the Galerie Lelong in New York City.
