This article is about the term used in rhetoric.  For the mathematical term, see Hyperbola.
Hyperbole (pronounced /haɪˈpɝːbəli/ hye-PER-buh-lee; "HYE-per-bowl" is a common mispronunciation) comes from ancient Greek "ὑπερβολή" (meaning excess or exaggeration) and is a figure of speech in which statements are exaggerated. It may be used to evoke strong feelings or to create a strong impression, but is rarely meant to be taken literally.

Hyperbole is used to create emphasis. It is a literary device often used in poetry, and is frequently encountered in casual speech. It is also a visual technique in which a deliberate exaggeration of a particular part of an image is employed. An example is the exaggeration of a person's facial feature in a political cartoon.

[edit] Etymology
Derived from the Greek ὑπερβολή (literally 'overshooting' or 'excess'), it is a cognate of hyperbola. Antonyms to hyperbole include meiosis, litotes, understatement, and bathos (the 'let down' after a hyperbole in a phrase).

[edit] Examples
Some examples of use of hyperbole include:

This cat smells like 50,000,000 years worth of spoiled milk! ( The cat smells bad )
These books weigh a ton. (These books are heavy.)
I could sleep for a year. (I could sleep for a long time.)
The path went on forever. (The path was really long.)
He beat him into a pulp. (He beat him up very harshly.)
He must have jumped a mile. (He jumped very high into the air.)
I'm doing over 9,000 things right now. (I'm busy.)
Boston State-House is the hub of the solar system. (Boston State-House is an important place.)


-Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., "The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table," Ch. 6


"Ladies and gentlemen, I've been to Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and I can say without hyperbole that this is a million times worse than all of them put together." This uses hyperbole to illustrate the use of hyperbole.
He was so big he used a tree trunk for a toothpick. (He is a huge person.)
I'd kill myself before listening to another one of his speeches. (His speeches are very unpleasant.)
This coffee tastes like an old man has been heated to render out the earwax. (This coffee tastes horrible.)

A common source of unwitting humour is when hyperbole is preceded by the word "literally":

"I was literally bullied at work in several different ways. I was forced to literally work with both hands tied behind my back. If I wanted time off I literally had to fight for it." [1]
