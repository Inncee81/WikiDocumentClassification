This is a list of novels commonly viewed as dystopian literature.
The majority of the listed works are not controversial, in the sense that their dystopian character is generally acknowledged. However, some are not universally classified as dystopias. Such debates frequently surround works that do not show the classic characteristics of dystopian fiction, such as a government that seeks total control of individuals' lives.
