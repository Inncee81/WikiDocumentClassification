Steve Jobs at WWDC 2006


Stevenote is a colloquial term for keynotes by Apple CEO Steve Jobs, generally given at Apple events such as the Macworld Expo, the Apple Expo and the annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Jobs is known for his vibrant speaking style and manner of exciting a crowd, particularly during his speeches at Macworld conferences.
The unique presentation style of his keynote speeches has led many people in the Macintosh community to refer to them as Stevenotes.
He usually wears a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by St. Croix, Levi's 501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers.[1]
Most new Apple product releases are first shown to the public in a presentation by Steve Jobs. Consequently, Stevenotes often cause substantial swings in Apple's stock price.[2]
The most recent Stevenote took place on October 14, 2008 during which Jobs introduced new MacBook models. The 2009 keynote address was not delivered by Steve Jobs but by Apple executive Philip Schiller instead. [3]

[edit] The keynote addresses
In 1997 Apple purchased NeXT, and Steve Jobs returned to Apple as the interim CEO, (referred to on company material as the iCEO [4]). He presented a keynote in 1997 giving a status report on the company and he talked about how Microsoft would help Apple get healthier again. No products were introduced or talked about in the 1997 keynote except that Microsoft Office 98 would be developed for Macintosh.
In the 1997 keynote, Steve Jobs announced "next, we have taken a look at browsers out there and Apple has decided to make Internet Explorer its default browser on the Macintosh". The audience booed and someone shouted "NO!" twice. Steve Jobs then went on to elaborate on his vision for Apple and why collaborating with the "only other desktop player" was beneficial. Most keynote presentations in following years have included disparaging, but playful, references to Microsoft and their products. Apple released Safari as the default browser in 2003 when Microsoft abandoned development of Internet Explorer for the Macintosh.
Jobs, who was formerly CEO of animation studio Pixar, often uses images and movies from Pixar films in his demonstrations. After Disney's acquisition of Pixar, these references have expanded to include Disney films as well.

[edit] Notable product introductions

In 1998 Steve Jobs introduced the iMac and the PowerBook G3. He also used "one more thing" to announce Apple's return to profitability.
In 1999 Steve Jobs introduced the iBook, QuickTime TV and AirPort wireless service.
In 2000 Steve Jobs introduced Mac OS X.
In 2001 Steve Jobs introduced the iPod.
In 2005 Steve Jobs introduced the Mac mini and iPod Nano.
In 2006 Steve Jobs introduced the first Intel-based Apple computer, the iMac Core Duo.
In 2007 Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone.
In 2008 Steve Jobs introduced the MacBook Air, iPhone 3G, and second generation aluminum 13" MacBook and 15" MacBook Pro notebooks.


[edit] "One more thing…"
An archetypal Steve Jobs Keynote starts with Jobs presenting sales figures for Apple products, and a review of Apple products released in the past few months. He then moves on to present one or more new products of moderate importance. After that, he feigns some concluding remarks, turns to leave the stage, then turns back and says "One more thing…". Usually the audience has some idea as to what product will be unveiled due to the Apple rumors community, but this is not always the case.
Some of the products which were revealed as "One more thing...":

The AirPort base station and Airport card after the iBook was introduced in Macworld Expo 1999.
The PowerBook G4.
The PowerMac G5 at WWDC 2003.
The fifth generation iPod with video, announced at a press conference self-referentially titled "One more thing...".
The MacBook Pro (at Macworld Expo 2006).
Introduction of selling movies via the iTunes Store in September 2006; a second "One more thing" in the same presentation also unveiled an upcoming product dubbed iTV (renamed to Apple TV at Macworld 2007). A third "One More Thing" was the lead-in to introduce a live performance of the song "Waiting for the World to Change" by John Mayer at the conclusion of the presentation.
Introduction of Safari for Windows Beta.
The iPod touch
The wireless version of the iTunes Store on the iPod touch and iPhone.
The Safari 3 Browser was shown running on Windows XP.
The new Macbook was introduced in October 2008 after the new Macbook Pro was introduced.
Though Steve Jobs did not present his Macworld 2009 keynote, Phil Schiller introduced the DRM free iTunes Music Store as a "one last thing".
