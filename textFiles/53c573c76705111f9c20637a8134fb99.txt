The second Dragonlance logo, used on most of the books and Dungeons & Dragons supplements set in the world.


Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR, Inc. into a series of popular fantasy novels. The Hickmans devised the concept that became Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job application. At TSR, Tracy met his future writing partner Margaret Weis, and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, and a series of novels, as well as licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures.
In 1984, TSR published the first Dragonlance novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight. It began the Chronicles Trilogy, a core element of Dragonlance. While the authoring team of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis wrote the setting's central books, numerous other authors contributed novels and short stories to the setting. Over 190 novels have used the Dragonlance setting, and have been accompanied by a supplemental campaign setting in the Dungeons & Dragons – style for over a decade. In 1997, Wizards of the Coast LLC purchased TSR, and licensed Dragonlance to Sovereign Press, Inc in 2001 to produce game materials; this licensing agreement expired in 2007.
The fictional Dragonlance world of Krynn contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography. The history of Krynn consists of six ages. The novels and related game products are primarily set in the fifth age, The Age of Despair. Since February 2009, the sixth age, the Age of Mortals, has been used. The Heroes of the Lance, created by Weis and Hickman, are the popular protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy, the first books set in the Dragonlance universe. Along with D&D's world of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds in fiction.

[edit] The world
The Dragonlance world is described in numerous books and novels. The setting contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography.

[edit] Krynn
Main article: Krynn
Dragonlance is set on the world of Krynn. The majority of the novels take place in the various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, northeast of Ansalon. Its major gods are Chaos and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. Depending on the time period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs share the world. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. Hickman had previously preached as a missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells.[1] During Krynn's various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian humanoid. The eggs of good dragons create evil draconians, and the eggs of evil dragons create good draconians.

[edit] Fictional history
Main article: Dragonlance timeline
The history of the world of Krynn, and thus the settings for both the novels and gaming supplements, is roughly split into six separate ages. The first age is the time of creation, when the gods are born and Krynn is formed. The Age of Dreams, the second age, is marked by the rapid growth of the world's first great civilizations. During the Age of Light, a myriad of new races appear. This era is also marked by three great wars between dragons and their minions. Following the Third Dragon War, in the Age of Might, the Cataclysm obliterates the great empire of Istar and changes almost all of Krynn's surface. A 300-year depression follows this event, in what is called the Age of Despair. This period also marks the War of the Lance. When Dragonlance was first introduced to Dungeons & Dragons, events happened during The Age of Despair. Since February 2009, the Age of Mortals has been used for most of the setting's new novels.

[edit] Characters
Main article: List of major Dragonlance characters




The Heroes of the Lance: from left Raistlin, Caramon, Tanis, Tasslehoff, Flint, Goldmoon, Riverwind, Sturm, Tika, and Laurana. Tracy Hickman keeps this Larry Elmore painting on the wall in his office.[2]


The Heroes of the Lance are the protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy, the first books set in the Dragonlance universe. They were created by Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player characters in games of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment. Hickman asked game designer Terry Phillips which player he had been given to play. Phillips played as wizard Raistlin Majere, and according to Hickman, when Phillips replied "the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real."[3]
Several other Heroes of the Lance were played by various people. Authors Gary and Janet Pack played the half-elf Tanis Half-Elven and the Kender Tasslehoff Burrfoot, respectively. Author Douglas Niles played the dwarf Flint Fireforge. TSR employee Harold Johnson played the Solamnic knight Sturm Brightblade. The rest of the Heroes are the barbarians Goldmoon and Riverwind, elf Laurana Kanan, and humans Caramon Majere (Raistlin's brother) and Tika Waylan. Weis played Fizban the Fabulous.[4]
In the beginning, Margaret Weis had problems depicting Tanis Half-Elven in the novels. Tracy Hickman finally told her "He's James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise." After that explanation, Margaret had no more troubles while writing about Tanis.[5] Other noteworthy antagonists, and sometimes protagonists, are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar, the half-sister of Raistlin and Caramon, and leader of one of the Dragonarmies of Ansalon. According to Hickman, Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write about, saying "Every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would try to run off with the story."[6]

[edit] Publication history

[edit] Creation




Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis at Gen Con 2008


Hickman developed his world creation technique by writing and self-publishing with his wife Laura the adventure modules Rahasia (1979) and Pharaoh (1980), and writing TSR's Ravenloft (1983).[7] He was unemployed in 1982, and TSR offered him a job based on his submission of several modules.[1] That year, while driving from Utah to Wisconsin to start a job with TSR, Hickman and his wife created the Dragonlance universe concept. During the trip, Hickman and his wife discussed two ideas they had had for several years: an entire world used to support a storyline, and a world dominated by dragons.[4]
Their ideas were well received by TSR, whose marketing department felt they had enough dungeons, but not enough dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and, after a period of months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR. The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer.[4]
TSR decided to create a franchise; including modules, board games, lead figures, and – for the first time – novels. Weis had been hired as an editor, and with Hickman they began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should be the ones to write the books.[1] They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel,[1] Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons of Despair.[8] TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight as a supplement to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game products.[9] TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order 30,000 copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of 50,000. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand.[1] Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and art books.[10]

[edit] Further development
In the mid to late-1980s, a rift developed between Weis and Hickman and TSR. They were feeling under-appreciated by the company, and when TSR turned down their Darksword series of novels, they went to Bantam Books. Bantam made them an offer, which they accepted, and they stopped writing Dragonlance novels for TSR.[1] They returned to write Dragons of Summer Flame for TSR in 1996, thinking it would be their final Dragonlance novel. At the time, Dragonlance gaming had been converted to the SAGA System, with limited success, and that combined with TSR's general financial troubles put the setting's future in doubt. Wizards of the Coast bought the troubled TSR in 1997, and Weis and Hickman then proposed Dragonlance's War of Souls trilogy; eventually published in 2000–2002. All three novels made the New York Times bestseller list and the setting was revitalized commercially.[4] The central books of the Dragonlance series were written by the authoring team of Weis and Hickman, however, many other writers have made contributions, including Richard A. Knaak, Douglas Niles, Roger E. Moore, Don Perrin, Jean Rabe, Paul B. Thompson, Tonya C. Cook, Michael Williams, Nancy Varian Berberick and Chris Pierson.
In 2001, Wizards of the Coast licensed Sovereign Press to publish further Dragonlance game materials. This began with the newly revised Dragonlance Campaign Setting in 2003, which used the new Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition.[4] On April 23, 2007, Weis announced Wizards of the Coast did not renew Sovereign's license, and that Dragonlance RPG game supplements and accessories would only be released through the end of the year.[11]

[edit] Reception
Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds, where writers place adventures in a world created by other writers.[12] The first Dragonlance trilogy, Chronicles, launched the Dungeons & Dragons line of novels, with many of its characters spun off into other novels.[13] Along with Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance is TSR's most popular series of novels. According to The 1990s by Marc Oxoby, what is most notable about the series is that "what may at one time been considered disposable, escapist literature" found "unprecedented popularity" in the 1990s.[14] All of the Dragonlance novels remained in print during the decade, turning Weis and Hickman into literary stars and boosting sales of their non Dragonlance novels. Although the series was initially published in paperback, its success led to hardcover printings. The hardcover version of Dragons of Summer Flame had an "impressive" first printing of 200,000 books.[14] Every Dragonlance novel by Weis and Hickman since 1995 has been released in hardcover, and some previous novels have been re-released in hardcover collectors editions.[15] Dragonlance made TSR one of the most successful publishers of science fiction and fantasy in the 1990s.[16]
By 2008, there were more than 190 novels in the Dragonlance franchise. [8] Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance novels have made over 20 bestseller lists, with sales in excess of 22 million.[16] The pair's novels have been translated into German, Japanese, Danish, Finnish, Spanish, French, Italian, Hebrew and Portuguese, and have sold well in the United States, Britain, and Australia.[1]
Not all critics have praised Dragonlance and Weis and Hickman. According to author Stephen Hunt, Wendy Bradley of Interzone magazine does not think highly of their work. Hunt feels that it's unusual for authors to receive such loathing among "fantasy's literary mafia", saying 'Behind every critic's scorn laden insult, there lays that unsaid thought at the end: "But I could have written that!"'[1] In Visions of Wonder, edited by David G. Hartwell and Milton T. Wolf and published by the Science Fiction Research Association, it is argued that Dragonlance is published under the "omnivore theory" of publishing. In this theory, the readership is made up of teenagers, and completely replaces itself every three to five years. This allows publishers to release subpar novels and still reach a small yet profitable audience.[17]

[edit] Novels
Main article: List of Dragonlance novels
The main storyline of the original Dragonlance series has been written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, with multiple books written by several further authors, covering different years in between and sometimes during the main events.

The Chronicles Trilogy relates the events since the meeting of the Companions until the end of the War of the Lance and the defeat of the Dragonarmies of Ansalon.
The Legends Trilogy covers the Blue Lady's War, as well as Raistlin Majere's and Caramon Majere's adventures in the past culminating in Raistlin's attempt at godhood. The books feature time travel, and focus on events in Istar shortly before the Cataclysm, and the ensuing Dwarfgate Wars.
The Second Generation is a single compilation book which picks the most important tales from the Tales series and details the children of the Companions, all of which become players in the later story. This book is considered in the main storyline, as it must be read to understand the events that happened between the War of the Lance and the Chaos War. These two novels developed characters that would later be seen in the War of Souls trilogy.
Dragons of Summer Flame covers the Chaos War, also known as the Second Cataclysm. The gods and mortals join forces to defeat Chaos in his attempt to destroy Krynn. The war ends with the withdrawal of Chaos and the gods of Krynn, in a divine agreement to keep the world safe.
Dragons of a New Age describes the rise of the Dragon Overlords and introduces the Fifth Age of Dragonlance. It leads into the War of Souls trilogy.
The War of Souls trilogy begins as a strange storm courses through Krynn, heralding the War of Souls. The end of the war brings the return of the gods, Takhisis's death and the departure of Paladine as head of the good gods, in order to maintain the balance between Good and Evil.
The Dark Disciple trilogy follows the death of Takhisis and the departure of Paladine, when the lesser gods strive to maintain dominance.
The Lost Chronicles trilogy is a companion to the original Chronicles. Each book of the trilogy fills in sections of the story previously left untold. It tells the story surrounding the recovery of the Hammer of Kharas,[18] how the Companions retrieve the dragon orb from Ice Wall, how Kitiara Uth Matar and Lord Soth became allies, and how Raistlin Majere took the Black Robes in Neraka.


[edit] Campaign setting
Main article: List of Dragonlance modules and sourcebooks




Dragonlance Adventures, the first Dragonlance campaign setting sourcebook


TSR created Dragonlance as a campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons system in 1982. They published the first sourcebook, Dragonlance Adventures, in 1987. When Advanced Dungeons & Dragons changed to its 2nd edition, the Dragonlance campaign setting changed with it. However, in the 1990s, Dragonlance was converted to use the new SAGA role playing system, which uses cards to determine the effects of actions. In 1996, Dragonlance: Fifth Age roleplaying game was released; the game used cards to produce random results instead of dice, and emphasized storyline development.[9] When the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons came out, Dragonlance was again represented by a new sourcebook (Dragonlance Campaign Setting), although no new adventures were published by Wizards of the Coast. Wizards of the Coast also turned over all responsibility for maintaining the Dragonlance setting in the 3rd edition to Margaret Weis's home company Sovereign Press.

[edit] In other media
In 2008, Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight was released direct-to-video, an animated movie based on the first Dragonlance book, Dragons of Autumn Twilight. The animation was produced by Toonz Animation, and starred the voices of Lucy Lawless, Kiefer Sutherland, Michael Rosenbaum, Michelle Trachtenberg.[19] A number of video games are also set in the Dragonlance world: including Heroes of the Lance (1988), Dragons of Flame (1989), War of the Lance (1989), Dragonstrike (1990), Shadow Sorcerer (1991), Champions of Krynn (1990), Death Knights of Krynn (1991), and The Dark Queen of Krynn (1992).
The series has inspired mention in music as well, including "Wishmaster," a song by Nightwish based partially on the relationship between Raistlin and Dalamar as a master and apprentice. The Swedish metal band Lake of Tears also recorded a song called "Raistlin and the Rose" in their 1997 album "Crimson Cosmos," while the German group Blind Guardian wrote "The Soulforged," another song inspired by Raistlin's story, which appeared in the band's 2002 album "A Night At the Opera."[20]
