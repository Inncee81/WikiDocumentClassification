A neologism (IPA: /niˈɒləˌdʒɪzəm/; from Greek neo 'new' + logos 'word') is a newly coined word that may be in the process of entering common use, but has not yet been accepted into mainstream language (which can take up to a generation[1]). Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person, publication, period, or event. The term neologism was coined in 1803.[2]

[edit] Other uses
In psychiatry, the term neologism is used to describe the use of words that only have meaning to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. This is considered normal in children, but a symptom of thought disorder (indicative of a psychotic mental illness, such as schizophrenia) in adults.[3]
People with autism also may create neologisms.[4]
Use of neologisms may also be related to aphasia acquired after brain damage resulting from a stroke or head injury.[5]
In theology, a neologism is a relatively new doctrine (for example, rationalism). In this sense, a neologist is an innovator in the area of a doctrine or belief system, and is often considered heretical or subversive by the mainstream clergy or religious institution(s).

[edit] Background
Neologisms tend to occur more often in cultures that are changing rapidly and also in situations where there is easy and fast propagation of information.[citation needed] The new terms are often created by combining existing words (see compound noun and adjective) or by giving words new and unique suffixes or prefixes. Portmanteaux are combined words that begin to be used commonly. Neologisms also can be created through abbreviation or acronym, by intentionally rhyming with existing words or simply through playing with sounds.
Neologisms often become popular through memetics, by way of mass media, the Internet, and word of mouth, including academic discourse in many fields renowned for their use of distinctive jargon. Recent coinages such as Fordism, Taylorism, Disneyfication, and McDonaldization are now in everyday use.[citation needed]. Every word in a language was, at some time, a neologism, ceasing to be such through time and acceptance.[citation needed]
Neologisms often become accepted parts of the language. Other times, however, they disappear from common use just as readily as they appeared. Whether a neologism continues as part of the language depends on many factors, probably the most important of which is acceptance by the public. Acceptance by linguistic experts and incorporation into dictionaries also plays a part, as does whether the phenomenon described by a neologism remains current, thus continuing to need a descriptor.[citation needed] It is unusual, however, for a word to enter common use if it does not resemble another word or words in an identifiable way.
When a word or phrase is no longer "new", it is no longer a neologism. Neologisms may take decades to become "old", however. Opinions differ on exactly how old a word must be to cease being considered a neologism; cultural acceptance probably plays a more important role than time in this regard.[citation needed]

[edit] Protologism
A protologism is a new word created in the hope that it will become accepted. A protologism may be no more than suggestion of a word that might be used, whereas a neologism is a word that has been used. The term protologism, itself a neologism, was coined by Mikhail Epstein in 2005.[6] Neologisms don't necessarily begin as protologisms since they may arise rapidly and unintentionally.
For a list of topically arranged protologisms, see Wiktionary:List of protologisms by topic.

[edit] Evolution of neologisms
Newly-created words entering a language tend to pass through the following stages:[citation needed]

Unstable – extremely new, being proposed, or being used only by a small subculture (also known as protologisms)
Diffused – having reached a significant frequency of use, but not yet having gained widespread acceptance
Stable – having gained recognizable, being en vogue, and perhaps, gaining lasting acceptance
Dated – the point where the word has ceased being novel, entered formal linguistic acceptance and, even may have passed into becoming a cliché
Passé – when a neologism becomes so culturally dated that the use of it is avoided because its use is seen as a stigma, a sign of being out of step with the norms of a changed cultural tradition, perhaps, with the neologism dropping from the lexicon altogether

[edit] Neologisms in literature
Many neologisms have come from popular literature and tend to appear in different forms. Most commonly, they are simply taken from a word used in the narrative of a book; a few representative examples are: "grok" (to achieve complete intuitive understanding), from Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein; "McJob", from Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture by Douglas Coupland; "cyberspace", from Neuromancer by William Gibson; "nymphet" from Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov.
Sometimes the title of a book becomes the neologism, for instance, Catch-22 (from the title of Joseph Heller's novel). Alternately, the author's name may become the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as "Orwellian" (from George Orwell, referring to his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four) and "Ballardesque" or "Ballardian" (from J.G. Ballard, author of Crash). Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle was the container of the Bokononism family of nonce words.
Another category is words derived from famous characters in literature, such as quixotic (referring to the titular character in Don Quixote de la Mancha by Cervantes), a scrooge (from the main character in Dickens's A Christmas Carol), or a pollyanna (from Eleanor H. Porter's book of the same name). James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, composed in a uniquely complex linguistic style, coined the words monomyth and quark.
Lewis Carroll has been called "the king of neologistic poems" because of his poem, "Jabberwocky", which incorporated dozens of invented words. The early modern English prose writings of Sir Thomas Browne are the source of many neologisms as recorded by the OED.
