[edit] Erez Aizen
Erez Aizen was born on 7 September 1980 and had early musical training; learning to play the organ at age 4 and studying piano in the Haifa Conservatory from the age of 8. At age 11 he started toying with computerised music, first using Impulse Tracker and later moving to more advanced musical composition software. By the age of 18, Erez had collaborated with DJ Jörg and other notable psytrance artists, and had released three albums and a multitude of tracks under different psytrance acts (including Shidapu and Shiva Shidapu).

[edit] Amit Duvdevani
Amit Duvdevani was born on 7 November 1974 and had a similar musical background. He played the piano for 9 years, starting at the age of 7, before taking a turn towards heavy metal and punk rock. Amit played keyboard and wrote most of the material for a local Haifa punk rock band Enzyme. Amit went to his first trance party in 1991, a week before being conscripted into the Israeli army (where he was first nicknamed Duvdev). He has more than once described this experience as life changing - from then onwards all he could think of was trance music. After he finished his national service, Amit spent a year in India (primarily in Goa), and finally decided to make music himself. He collaborated with a member of Shidapu on four tracks although they were never released.

[edit] Biography
In 1998, Aizen and Duvdevani began playing together. At first they released a few tracks as Shidapu & Duvdev. These tracks were 'happier' and of the simpler side of trance. Later on, they formed the duo Infected Mushroom and started working on their first album. The name Infected Mushroom was taken, without permission, from a disbanded (1989 to 1993) punk rock band named "Infected Mushroom" also of Israeli origin, which Duvdevani knew and saw perform at a concert in Israel.
Guitarists Tom Cunningham and Erez Netz joined in 2004 - Tom plays with Infected Mushroom in the United States, while Erez Netz plays the rest of their gigs. Netz is a famous Israeli guitarist and opens their live shows with some exhibition. In 2007, Infected Mushroom brought in Brazilian percussionist Rogério Jardim to play drums and percussion during their shows.
In 2007, Infected Mushroom rose to No.9 in the influential DJmag Top 100 DJs poll,[2] where they were the highest placed psytrance DJs. This was the first time the category had been created, reflecting psytrance's rising popularity around the world and the pioneering role Infected Mushroom have played in this.
