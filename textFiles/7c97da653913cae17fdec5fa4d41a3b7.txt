[edit] History
In 2003, the development of Wakka Wiki came abruptly to an end although a large community of users and contributors was still posting bugfixes, extensions, and new functions. First released in May 2004 by Jason Tourtelotte, WikkaWiki rapidly grew into a project aiming to remain faithful to Wakka's heritage of a lightweight engine with readable and accessible code. WikkaWiki has recently seen a substantial increase in development activity[1] thanks to its team of developers and community of contributors.

[edit] Wikka vision
Compared to heavier wiki engines, which integrate several built-in functions, WikkaWiki's goal is to keep its core as small as possible while developing an architecture that supports easy extensibility through plugin modules. The latest version 1.1.6.6 was released on February 14, 2009.[2] This release is a maintenance release that introduces several new features. According to Secunia, WikkaWiki does not suffer from any unpatched vulnerability as of the latest release.[3]

[edit] Wikka features
Among the distinctive features of this wiki engine:

Support for different types of embedded elements:




images
Flash
tabular data
safe HTML code
RSS feeds
i-frames
mindmaps, through built-in support for FreeMind data




Advanced access control with user registration, password management, and provision for user profiles, as well as access control lists on a per-page basis.


Administration modules to manage pages and users, including tools for bulk operations like user removal or page reversion.


Advanced syntax highlighting using GeSHi:

support for 68 markup/programming languages
easily customizable output
line numbering
clickable markup pointers to official documentation
on-the-fly downloading of embedded code blocks




Several page-related features, including full revision control, comments, categories, text searching, page cloning, advanced referrer management, file uploading/downloading interface, and a GUI page editor.


W3C compliant XHTML 1.0 transitional and CSS.
CSS-defined printable view.
Advanced tools for publishing page revisions, including:




RSS feeds for recent modifications and page revisions (with autodiscovery)
WikiPing client functionality, allowing page changes to be broadcast and tracked on a remote WikiPing server




SmartTitle function, generating human- and search-engine-friendly page titles.
A web-based wizard to install the package and to upgrade from WakkaWiki.
A large repository of user-contributed plugins.


[edit] Development
Forthcoming releases may include:

Enhanced configurability (e.g., user selectable/editable skins and menus).
Dynamically-generated API documentation.
API for syndicating content from remote wikis.
Google Maps support.
Plugin architecture for modularization


[edit] Documentation
A dedicated server provides extensive documentation and tutorials, targeted at different categories of users, from the end user to the developer.[4]
