[edit] History
It was initially created to be able to easily backup or create a distributable copy of an Ubuntu or derivative installation. Inspiration for this tool came from the mklivecd script that Mandriva uses and the remasterme script that is in PCLinuxOS. Since those scripts are not very easy to port to Ubuntu, it was written from scratch.

[edit] Uses
It is a very useful and easy way to create a customized Live CD/DVD version of Ubuntu, once the system is installed and configured with programs, updates, etc... the user just has to:

Download and install the latest version of Remastersys from: http://remastersys.klikit-linux.com/repository/remastersys/
Open the program (a shortcut is created on the desktop) and then choose the dist or backup option, and then the iso of the Live CD will be automatically created.

The resulting iso can also be installed on a USB pendrive, creating a Live USB distro, using either a command-line approach[1] or a graphical tool such as UNetbootin.
It has a command line version and a GUI version. It currently works with Ubuntu, and possibly more Ubuntu-based distributions.
