Sample






An example of Calibri Regular, Bold and Italic


Calibri is a humanist sans-serif typeface family under the Microsoft ClearType Font Collection.
In Microsoft Office 2007, it replaced Times New Roman as the default typeface in Word[1] and replaced Arial as the default in PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook.
Calibri was designed by Lucas de Groot for Microsoft to take advantage of Microsoft's ClearType rendering technology.

[edit] Characteristics
The subtle rounded stems and corners, which are visible at larger sizes, create a warm and soft character. The typeface includes characters from Latin, Latin extended, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts. OpenType features include small caps, subscripts and superscripts, and extra ligatures.
As with other sans-serif ClearType Collection fonts, it includes unique italic type features, which are common in modern typefaces.

[edit] Availability
The typeface is distributed with Windows Vista, Microsoft Office 2007, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac. It can also be separately downloaded from Microsoft.
The typeface — along with Candara, Consolas, Cambria, Constantia, and Corbel — is also distributed with the free Powerpoint 2007 Viewer[2] and the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.[3]
The retail version of the typeface is sold by Ascender Corporation, as well as by Monotype Imaging in MicroType format as part of the Vista 8 Font Set package.

[edit] Awards
Calibri won the TDC2 2005 award under the Type System category.[4]
