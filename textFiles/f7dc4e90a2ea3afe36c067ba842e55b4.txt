Planet Earth is a multi award-winning 2006 television series produced by the BBC Natural History Unit. Four years in the making, it was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC, and also the first to be filmed in high definition.[1] The series was co-produced by the Discovery Channel and NHK in association with CBC, and was described by its makers as "the definitive look at the diversity of our planet".
Planet Earth was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One in March 2006, and premiered one year later in the USA on the Discovery Channel. By June 2007, it had been shown in 130 countries worldwide.[2] The original BBC version was narrated by David Attenborough and produced by Alastair Fothergill. For Discovery, the executive producer was Maureen Lemire, with Sigourney Weaver's voiceover replacing Attenborough.
The series comprises eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different habitat on Earth. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series.

[edit] Background
In 2001 the BBC broadcast The Blue Planet, a landmark series on the natural history of the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures and audience appreciation ratings and a string of awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so Alastair Fothergill decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking at the whole planet. The idea for Planet Earth was born, and the series was commissioned by Lorraine Heggessey, then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002.[3]
A feature film version of Planet Earth was commissioned alongside the television series, repeating the successful model established with The Blue Planet and its companion film Deep Blue. Earth was released around the world from 2007 to 2009. There was also another accompanying television series, Planet Earth: The Future, which looked at the environmental problems facing some of the species and habitats featured in the main series in more detail.

[edit] Production

[edit] Production team
With a budget of UK£16 million[4], Planet Earth is the most expensive documentary series the BBC has ever made.[5] The corporation signed a co-financing deal with the Discovery Channel and NHK (Japan’s state broadcaster), its production partners on The Blue Planet, to spread the cost of the ambitious project. Under the terms of the deal, Discovery retained the US rights and NHK the Japanese rights, while BBC Worldwide retained the rights for the rest of the world.[6] Together, the Discovery and NHK financing amounted to 60–70% of the cost of the series, which paid for the upgrade to the high-definition format.[7] BBC Worldwide also funded the additional £7.4 million budget of Earth, the feature film.[8]
The production duties were handled by the BBC Natural History Unit under the leadership of executive producer Alastair Fothergill. The individual episodes were overseen by six producers: Vanessa Berlowitz, Mark Brownlow, Andy Byatt, Huw Cordey, Jonny Keeling and Mark Linfield. They directed the film crews in the field, backed up by a team of production co-ordinators and researchers at the Natural History Unit's offices in Bristol, England. In addition, the supporting team of scientists, guides, fixers, pilots, drivers and field assistants numbered in the hundreds or even thousands.[3]
Post-production was carried out using BBC Resources' facilities in Bristol. Investment in new technology enabled the series to be edited and delivered without using videotapes.[9] Planet Earth's distinctive use of satellite imagery and time-lapse effects were provided by design company Burrell Durrant Hifle, using NASA photography.[10] The original score was composed and conducted by George Fenton, a veteran of previous BBC natural history documentaries, and performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra. The script was written by the producers with input from David Attenborough,[7] though the US episodes feature different narration and are slightly shorter in length.[9]

[edit] Filming
Production began in 2002 and was completed in autumn 2006, shortly before the final six episodes went to air.[11] The first year after commissioning was spent on researching and planning the shoots. To capture all the footage required by the producers, 71 cameramen and women filmed in 204 locations in 62 different countries on all seven continents, spending more than 2000 days in the field.[12]
The decision to film Planet Earth in high definition (HD) was initially regarded by the BBC as a risk. In 2002, the technology was still largely untested in the field, and Fothergill was concerned about the difficulties of adapting to the new cameras.[13] Despite the reservations, the HD cameras proved to be reliable and even out-performed traditional film cameras in certain situations. Their high sensitivity allowed the team to film at lower light levels than film cameras, in dark rainforests for example. Without the concerns of running out of film, the length of shoots with HD cameras were limited only by capacity of batteries. This improved the chances of capturing interesting behaviour, and enabled longer aerial shoots. HD also improved the quality of the transfer to the cinema screen.
Panasonic VariCam HD cameras were used for land-based footage[14] and Sony HD cameras for aerial sequences.[9] The latter, a distinctive feature of Planet Earth, were shot using a technique borrowed from Hollywood action films. Mark Kelem, the aerial cameraman, had previously worked on Mission: Impossible III and Black Hawk Down. The camera was mounted in a device called a Heligimbal, a gyroscopically-stabilised housing attached to the underside of a helicopter and controlled by joystick from inside the cockpit. The unit was lightweight, enabling lenses with a longer reach to be attached (up to 40x magnification). This enabled him to capture steady images of individual creatures from a height which prevented the noise of the helicopter from disturbing them.

[edit] TV firsts
One of the producers' aims was build as much unique footage into Planet Earth as possible, and the crews succeeded in filming a number of species, locations and events from the natural world which had never before been shown on television,[15][16] including:

Wild Bactrian camels filmed eating snow in the Gobi desert
An Amur leopard mother and cub in the forests of eastern Russia
A sequence showing a snow leopard hunting markhor in north-west Pakistan
Male birds of paradise displaying in the jungles of New Guinea
Emperor penguins filmed enduring an Antarctic winter at their rookery
Arctic wolf and African wild dog hunts filmed from the air
The highest-ever aerial footage of Mount Everest and the Karakoram
Humpback whales using a technique called bubble-netting to corral fish
Chimpanzees killing and eating one of their own
Desperate lions hunting and killing an elephant at night
A piranha feeding frenzy filmed in the water with the fish
Unprecedented access to the dramatic Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico
The oceanic whitetip shark, a rare ocean wanderer


[edit] Broadcast details

[edit] British television
The episodes are each an hour in length, comprising the main programme and a 10-minute featurette called Planet Earth Diaries which details the filming of a particular event. In the UK, Planet Earth was split into two parts, broadcast in spring and autumn 2006. The first five episodes premiered on BBC One at 9:00pm on Sundays, beginning on 5 March 2006. The programmes were repeated the following Saturday in an early evening slot on BBC Two. Along with its 2005 dramatisation of Bleak House, the BBC selected Planet Earth for its trial of high-definition broadcasts.[17] The opening episode was its first-ever scheduled programme in the format, shown 27 May 2006 on the BBC HD channel.
The first episode in the autumn series, "Great Plains", received its first public showing at the Edinburgh International Television Festival on 26 August 2006. It was shown on a giant screen in Conference Square.[18] The remaining episodes were broadcast from 5 November 2006 in the same primetime BBC One slot, following a further repeat run of the spring programmes on BBC Four. The autumn episodes were broadcast simultaneously on BBC HD and were repeated on BBC Four the following week.
Besides being BBC One's featured "One to Watch" programme of the day, Planet Earth was heavily trailed on the BBC's television and radio channels both before and during its run. The music that was featured in the BBC trailers for the series is the track "Hoppípolla" from the album Takk... by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. Following the advertisements, interest was so widespread that the single was re-released.[19] In the USA, the series was promoted using "The Time Has Come" from Epic Score, composed by Gabriel Shadid and Tobias Marberger.[20] The Australian trailers initially used "Jupiter: The Bringer of Jollity" from Gustav Holst's orchestral suite The Planets, but later reverted to "Hoppípolla".

[edit] US television
On 25 March 2007, the series began its run on American television on the Discovery Channel, garnering massive ratings and critical acclaim. Award-winning actress and conservationist Sigourney Weaver replaced David Attenborough as the narrator. It was the most watched show on Discovery since The Flight That Fought Back on 11 September 2005. The show was broadcast on Sundays in one 3-hour block followed by four 2-hour blocks, with the episodes shown in a different running order to the UK broadcast. It was also transmitted in high definition on the then Discovery HD Theater at the same time as its SD premiere. Edited versions were later broadcast on The Science Channel and Animal Planet. In the Discovery Channel version, the Planet Earth Diaries segment was retitled Capturing the Shot.

[edit] Other territories
The BBC pre-sold the series to several overseas broadcasters,[21] including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, China Central Television, Germany's WDR, the Indian Discovery Channel, New Zealand's Prime Television and C1R in Russia. The series was eventually sold to 130 countries.[22]
In Canada, the series did not air on the Canadian Discovery Channel, as it is owned by CTV and the Canadian rights were exclusively sold to CBC.[23]

[edit] Episodes

"A hundred years ago, there were one and a half billion people on Earth. Now, over six billion crowd our fragile planet. But even so, there are still places barely touched by humanity. This series will take you to the last wildernesses and show you the planet and its wildlife as you have never seen them before."
– David Attenborough's opening narration


[edit] 1. "From Pole to Pole"

UK broadcast 5 March 2006, 9.41 million viewers (34% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 25 March 2007

The first episode illustrates a 'journey' around the globe and reveals the effect of gradual climatic change and seasonal transitions en route. During Antarctica's winter, emperor penguins endure four months of darkness, with no food, in temperatures of −70 °C (−94.0 °F). Meanwhile, as spring arrives in the Arctic, polar bear cubs take their first steps into a world of rapidly thawing ice. In northern Canada, the longest overland migration of any animal — over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) — is that of three million caribou, which are hunted by wolves, and one such pursuit is shown. The forests of eastern Russia are home to the Amur leopard; with a population of just 40 individuals, it is now the world's rarest cat. This is primarily because of the destruction of its habitat, and Attenborough states that it "symbolises the fragility of our natural heritage." However, in the tropics, the jungle that covers 3% of the planet's surface supports 50% of its species. Other species shown include New Guinea's birds of paradise, African hunting dogs in their efficient pursuit of impala, elephants in Africa migrating towards the waters of the Okavango Delta, a seasonal bloom of life in the otherwise arid Kalahari Desert, and 300,000 migrating Baikal teal, containing the world's entire population of the species in one flock. The Planet Earth Diaries segment shows how the wild dog hunt was filmed unobtrusively with the aid of the Heligimbal: a powerful, gyro-stabilised camera mounted beneath a helicopter.[25]

[edit] 2. "Mountains"




The Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram



UK broadcast 12 March 2006, 8.57 million viewers (30% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 25 March 2007

The second instalment focuses on the mountains. All the main ranges are explored with extensive aerial photography. Ethiopia's Erta Ale is the longest continually erupting volcano — for over 100 years. On the nearby highlands, geladas (the only primate whose diet is almost entirely of grass) inhabit precipitous slopes nearly three miles (5 km) up, in troops that are 800-strong: the most numerous of their kind. Alongside them live the critically endangered walia ibex, and both species take turns to act as lookout for predatory Ethiopian wolves. The Andes have the most volatile weather and guanacos are shown enduring a flash blizzard, along with an exceptional group sighting of the normally solitary puma. The Alpine summits are always snow-covered, apart from that of the Matterhorn, which is too sheer to allow it to settle. Grizzly bear cubs emerge from their den for the first time in the Rockies, while Himalayan inhabitants include rutting markhor, golden eagles that hunt migrating demoiselle cranes, and the rare snow leopard. At the eastern end of the range, the giant panda cannot hibernate due to its poor nutriment of bamboo and one of them cradles its week-old cub. Also shown is the Earth's biggest mountain glacier: the Baltoro in Pakistan, which is 43 miles (69 km) long and visible from space. Planet Earth Diaries demonstrates the difficulty of obtaining the first ever close-up footage of the snow leopards: a process which took over a year.[26]


[edit] 3. "Fresh Water"

UK broadcast 19 March 2006, 8.83 million viewers (32% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 15 April 2007

The fresh water programme describes the course taken by rivers and some of the species that take advantage of such a habitat. Only 3% of the world's water is fresh, yet all life on land is ultimately dependent on it. Its journey begins as a stream in the mountains, illustrated by Venezuela's Tepui, where there is a tropical downpour almost every day. It then travels hundreds of miles before forming rapids. With the aid of some expansive helicopter photography, one sequence demonstrates the vastness of Angel Falls, the world's highest free-flowing waterfall. Its waters drop unbroken for nearly 3,000 feet (1,000 m) and are blown away as a mist before they reach the bottom. The erosive nature of rivers is shown by the Grand Canyon, created over five million years by the Colorado River. In Japan, the water is inhabited by the biggest amphibian, the two-metre long giant salamander, while in the northern hemisphere, salmon undertake the largest freshwater migration, and are hunted en route by grizzly bears. Also featured are smooth coated otters repelling mugger crocodiles and the latter's Nile cousin ambushing wildebeest as they cross the Mara River. Roseate spoonbills are numerous in the Pantanal and are prey to spectacled caiman. In addition, there are cichlids, piranhas, river dolphins and swimming crab-eating macaques. Planet Earth Diaries shows how a camera crew filmed a piranha feeding frenzy in Brazil — after a two-week search for the opportunity.[27]




The Lechuguilla Cave



[edit] 4. "Caves"

UK broadcast 26 March 2006, 8.98 million viewers (33% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 22 April 2007

This episode explores "planet Earth's final frontier": the world of caves. At a depth of 1,300 feet (400 m), Mexico's Cave of Swallows is Earth's deepest pit cave freefall drop, allowing entry by skydivers. Its volume could contain New York City's Empire State Building. Also featured is Borneo's Deer Cave and Gomantong Cave. Inhabitants of the former include three million wrinkle-lipped bats, which have deposited guano on to an enormous mound. In Gomantong Cave, guano is many metres high and is blanketed with hundreds of thousands of cockroaches and other invertebrates. Also depicted are eyeless, subterranean creatures, such as the Texas blind salamander and ("bizarrely") a species of crab. Mexico's Cueva de Villa Luz is also featured, with its flowing stream of sulphuric acid and snottite formations made of living bacteria. A fish species, the shortfin molly, has adapted to this habitat. The programme ends in New Mexico's Lechuguilla Cave (discovered in 1986) where sulphuric acid has produced unusually ornate, gypsum crystal formations. Planet Earth Diaries reveals how a camera team spent a month among the cockroaches on the guano mound in Gomantong Cave and describes the logistics required to photograph Lechuguilla. Permission for the latter took two years and local authorities are unlikely to allow another visit.[28]

[edit] 5. "Deserts"

UK broadcast 2 April 2006, 9.23 million viewers (34% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 1 April 2007

This instalment features the harsh environment that covers one third of the Earth: the deserts. Due to Siberian winds, Mongolia's Gobi Desert reaches extremes of temperature like no other, ranging from -40°C to +50°C (-40°F to 122°F). It is home to the rare Bactrian camel, which eats snow to maintain its fluid level and must limit itself to 10 litres (2.6 U.S. gal; 2.2 imp gal) a day if it is not to prove fatal. Africa's Sahara is the size of the USA, and just one of its severe dust storms could cover the whole of Great Britain. While some creatures, such as the dromedary, take them in their stride, for others the only escape from such bombardments is to bury themselves in the sand. Few rocks can resist them either and the outcrops shown in Egypt's White Desert are being inexorably eroded. The biggest dunes (1,000 ft or 300 m high) are to be found in Namibia, while other deserts featured are the Atacama in Chile, the Sonoran in Arizona, and areas of the Australian outback and Utah. Animals are shown searching for food and surviving in such an unforgiving habitat: African elephants that walk up to 50 miles (80 km) per day to find food; lions (hunting oryx); red kangaroos (which moisten their forelegs with saliva to keep cool); nocturnal fennec foxes, acrobatic flat lizards feeding on black flies, and duelling Nubian ibex. The final sequence illustrates one of nature's most fearsome spectacles: a billion-strong plague of desert locusts, destroying all vegetation in its path. Planet Earth Diaries explains how the hunt for the elusive Bactrian camels necessitated a two-month trek in Mongolia.[29]

[edit] 6. "Ice Worlds"




The aurora borealis in Alaska



UK broadcast 5 November 2006, 6.37 million viewers (24% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 1 April 2007

The sixth programme looks at the regions of the Arctic and Antarctica. The latter contains 90% of the world's ice, and stays largely deserted until the spring, when visitors arrive to harvest its waters. Snow petrels take their place on nunataks and begin to court, but are preyed on by South Polar skuas. During summer, a pod of humpback whales hunt krill by creating a spiralling net of bubbles. The onset of winter sees the journey of emperor penguins to their breeding grounds, 100 miles (160 km) inland. Their eggs transferred to the males for safekeeping, the females return to the ocean while their partners huddle into large groups to endure the extreme cold. At the northern end of the planet, Arctic residents include musk oxen, who are hunted by Arctic foxes and wolves. A female polar bear and her two cubs head off across the ice to look for food. As the sun melts the ice, a glimpse of the Earth's potential future reveals a male polar bear that is unable to find a firm footing anywhere and has to resort to swimming — which it cannot do indefinitely. Its desperate need to eat brings it to a colony of walrus. Although it attacks repeatedly, the herd is successful in evading it by returning to the sea. Wounded and unable to feed, the bear will not survive. Meanwhile, back in Antarctica, the eggs of the emperor penguins finally hatch. Planet Earth Diaries tells of the battle with the elements to obtain the penguin footage and of unwelcome visits from polar bears.[30]

[edit] 7. "Great Plains"

UK broadcast 12 November 2006, 6.72 million viewers (24% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 8 April 2007

This episode deals with savanna, steppe, tundra, prairie, and looks at the importance and resilience of grasses in such treeless ecosystems. Their vast expanses contain the largest concentration of animal life. In Outer Mongolia, a herd of Mongolian gazelle flee a bush fire and has to move on to new grazing, but grass can repair itself rapidly and soon reappears. On the Arctic tundra during spring, millions of migratory snow geese arrive to breed and their young are preyed on by Arctic foxes. Meanwhile, time-lapse photography depicts moving herds of caribou as a calf is brought down by a chasing wolf. On the North American prairie, bison engage in the ritual to establish the dominant males. The Tibetan Plateau is the highest of the plains and despite its relative lack of grass, animals do survive there, including yak and wild ass. However, the area's most numerous resident is the pika, whose nemesis is the Tibetan fox. In tropical India, the tall grasses hide some of the largest creatures and also the smallest, such as the pygmy hog. The final sequence depicts the African savannah and elephants that are forced to share a waterhole with a pride of thirty lions. The insufficient water makes it an uneasy alliance and the latter gain the upper hand during the night when their hunger drives them to hunt and eventually kill one of the pachyderms. Planet Earth Diaries explains how the lion hunt was filmed in darkness using infrared light.[31]

[edit] 8. "Jungles"




A Costa Rican tree frog



UK broadcast 19 November 2006, 7.04 million viewers (26% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 15 April 2007

The next instalment examines jungles and tropical rainforests. These environments occupy only 3% of the land yet are home to over half of the world's species. New Guinea is inhabited by almost 40 kinds of birds of paradise, which avoid conflict with each other by living in different parts of the island. Some of their elaborate courtship displays are shown. Within the dense forest canopy, sunlight is prized, and the death of a tree triggers a race by saplings to fill the vacant space. Figs are a widespread and popular food, and as many as 44 types of bird and monkey have been observed picking from a single tree. The sounds of the jungle throughout the day are explored, from the early morning calls of siamangs and orangutans to the nocturnal cacophony of courting tree frogs. The importance of fungi to the rainforest is illustrated by a sequence of them fruiting, including a parasite called cordyceps. The mutual benefits of the relationship between carnivorous pitcher plants and red crab spiders is also discussed. In the Congo, roaming forest elephants are shown reaching a clearing to feed on essential clay minerals within the mud. Finally, chimpanzees are one of the few jungle animals able to traverse both the forest floor and the canopy in search of food. In Uganda, members of a 150-strong community of the primates mount a raid into neighbouring territory in order to gain control of it. Planet Earth Diaries looks at filming displaying birds of paradise, focusing mainly on the filming of the six-plumed bird of paradise.[32]

[edit] 9. "Shallow Seas"

UK broadcast 26 November 2006, 7.32 million viewers (28% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 8 April 2007

This programme is devoted to the shallow seas that fringe the world's continents. Although they constitute 8% of the oceans, they contain most marine life. As humpback whales return to breeding grounds in the tropics, a mother and its calf are followed. While the latter takes in up to 500 litres of milk a day, its parent will starve until it travels back to the poles to feed — and it must do this while it still has sufficient energy left for the journey. The coral reefs of Indonesia are home to the biggest variety of ocean dwellers. Examples include banded sea kraits, which ally themselves with goatfish and trevally in order to hunt. In Western Australia, dolphins 'hydroplane' in the shallowest waters to catch a meal, while in Bahrain, 100,000 Socotra cormorants rely on shamals that blow sand grains into the nearby Persian Gulf, transforming it into a rich fishing ground. The appearance of algae in the spring starts a food chain that leads to an abundant harvest, and sea lions and dusky dolphins are among those taking advantage of it. In Southern Africa, as chokka squid are preyed on by short-tail stingray, the Cape fur seals that share the waters are hunted by the world's largest predatory fish: the great white shark. On Marion Island in the Indian Ocean, a group of king penguins must cross a beach occupied by fur seals that do not hesitate to attack them. Planet Earth Diaries shows the difficulties of filming the one-second strike of a great white shark.[33]

[edit] 10. "Seasonal Forests"




A stand of giant redwoods



UK broadcast 3 December 2006, 7.42 million viewers (29% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 22 April 2007

The penultimate episode surveys the coniferous and deciduous seasonal woodland habitats — the most extensive forests on Earth. Conifers begin sparsely in the Arctic but soon dominate the land, and the taiga circles the globe, containing a third of all the Earth's trees. Few creatures can survive the Arctic climate all year round, but the moose and wolverine are exceptions. One thousand miles (1,600 km) to the south, on the Pacific coast of North America, conifers have reached their full potential. These include some of the world's tallest trees: the redwoods. Here, a pine marten is shown stalking a squirrel, and great grey owl chicks take their first flight. Further south still, in the Valdivian forests of Chile, a population of smaller animals exist, including the pudú and the kodkod. During spring in a European broad-leaved forest, a mandarin duck leads its day-old family to leap from its tree trunk nest to the leaf litter below. On a summer night on North America's east coast, periodical cicadas emerge en masse to mate — an event that occurs every seventeen years. After revisiting Russia's Amur leopards in winter, a timelapse sequence illustrates the effect of the ensuing spring on the deciduous forest floor. In India's teak forests, a langur monkey strays too far from the chital that act as its sentinels and falls prey to a tiger. Planet Earth Diaries explains how aerial shots of the baobab were achieved by the use of a cinebulle, an adapted hot air balloon.[34]

[edit] 11. "Ocean Deep"

UK broadcast 10 December 2006, 6.02 million viewers (22% audience share)[24]; US broadcast 25 March 2007

The final instalment concentrates on the most unexplored area of the planet: the deep ocean. It begins with a whale shark used as a shield by a shoal of bait fish to protect themselves from yellowfin tuna. Also shown is an oceanic whitetip shark trailing rainbow runners. Meanwhile, a 500-strong school of dolphins head for the Azores, where they work together to feast on scad mackerel. Down in the ocean's furthest reaches, some creatures defy classification. On the sea floor, scavengers such as the spider crab bide their time, awaiting carrion from above. The volcanic mountain chain at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean also sustains life through the bacteria that surround its sulphide vents. There are thought to be around 30,000 undersea volcanoes, some of them taller than Mount Everest. Their sheer cliffs provide anchorage for several corals and sponges. Nearer the surface, the currents that surround these seamounts force nutrients up from below and thus marine life around them is abundant. Off the Mexican coast, a large group of sailfish encircle another shoal of bait fish. The hunters change colour as a message of their intentions, since an attack could also be fatal to others of their number. The last sequence depicts the largest animal on Earth: the blue whale, of which 300,000 once roamed the world's oceans. Now fewer than 3% remain. Planet Earth Diaries shows the search in the Bahamas for oceanic whitetip sharks.[35]

"Our planet is still full of wonders. As we explore them, so we gain not only understanding, but power. It's not just the future of the whale that today lies in our hands: it's the survival of the natural world in all parts of the living planet. We can now destroy or we can cherish. The choice is ours."
– David Attenborough, in closing


[edit] Planet Earth: The Future
Main article: Planet Earth: The Future
The latter episodes were supplemented by Planet Earth: The Future, a series of three 60-minute films that highlight the conservation issues surrounding some of the featured species and environments. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was Fergus Beeley. The series began transmission on BBC Four after the ninth episode, "Shallow Seas".[36]

[edit] Feature film
Main article: Earth (2007 film)
BBC Worldwide and Greenlight Media secured financing for a US$15 million film version of Planet Earth, to be distributed in several territories. This follows the earlier success of a theatrical edition of The Blue Planet, entitled Deep Blue[37]. Earth was directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Winfield; it is of 90 minutes' duration and was released in autumn 2007.[36]

[edit] Reception



This section requires expansion.


Time magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 New TV Series of 2007, ranking it at #4.[38]

[edit] Merchandise




Planet Earth DVD © BBC


The popularity of the television series around the world translated into strong sales of associated Planet Earth merchandise. In the USA, it became the fastest-selling DVD in the Discovery Channel's history, and the high-definition (HD) discs generated US$3.2 million in sales in just two months.[12] By the end of 2007, US sales had topped 3 million units, making it the highest grossing HD title and one of the top ten DVD titles of the year.[39]
Further details of Planet Earth's releases on a variety of media are provided below. In addition, the brand was licensed to other companies to produce calendars, a board game, jigsaws, stationery, cards and more.

[edit] DVD
A five-disc DVD box set of the complete series (BBCDVD1883) was released in the UK for regions 2 and 4 (PAL) on 27 November 2006 by 2 entertain. It is presented in 5.1-channel Dolby Digital surround sound and 16:9 widescreen video. The bonus features include Planet Earth Diaries (presented immediately after each episode as for the original TV broadcast) and Planet Earth: The Future,[40] (see above). In the USA, two versions of the same five-disc set were released as a region 1 DVD on 24 April 2007. The BBC Warner release retained David Attenborough's narration from the original British television broadcasts, but the Discovery Channel edition used the alternative Sigourney Weaver voiceover.

[edit] HD DVD and Blu-Ray
Except for a small amount of extremely hard-to-obtain footage,[41] Planet Earth was filmed entirely in high definition, and consequently became one of the first television series to take advantage of the new HD disc formats.
The series was released in both Blu-Ray and HD DVD formats as a five-disc region B box set on 12 November 2007. On the fifth disc, the bonus features from the standard definition DVD set were replaced by two episodes from the BBC's Natural World series, "Desert Lions" and "Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth", both also presented in high definition.[42]
In the USA, the series was released as a four-disc set in both high definition formats,[43] the Blu-Ray version on single-layer BD-25 discs[44] and the HD DVD set on dual-layer HD DVD-30 discs.[45] The US high-definition releases omit the extra disc of bonus features from the standard-definition boxed set.[46]
Both the Blu-ray and HD DVD versions feature high-definition transfers in 1080p resolution (though they are labelled as 1080i on the packaging).[citation needed] As for the standard definition sets, all versions use Attenborough's narration.

[edit] Books
BBC Books has published four books to accompany the television series:

Planet Earth: As You've Never Seen It Before, the official tie-in, was written by Alastair Fothergill with a foreword by David Attenborough (ISBN 978-0563522126). It was published in hardback on 5 October 2006 .
The paperback title Planet Earth: The Making of an Epic Series by David Nicholson-Lord (ISBN 978-0563493587) revealed some of the tales from the field during filming expeditions. It was published on 9 March 2006
A second paperback, a companion to Planet Earth: The Future edited by Fergus Beeley and Rosamund Kidman Cox with a foreword by Jonathon Porritt (ISBN 978-0563539056), was also published on 5 October 2006.
A collection of still images from the series was published in a hardcover volume as Planet Earth: The Photographs by Alastair Fothergill (ISBN 978-1846073465) on 7 October 2007.


[edit] Soundtrack album
Main article: Planet Earth (soundtrack)
