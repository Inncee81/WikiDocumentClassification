Plot of the error function


In mathematics, the error function (also called the Gauss error function) is a special function (non-elementary) of sigmoid shape which occurs in probability, statistics, materials science, and partial differential equations. It is defined as:



The complementary error function, denoted erfc, is defined in terms of the error function:



The complex error function, denoted w(x), (also known as the Faddeeva function) is also defined in terms of the error function:

[edit] Properties




Fig.2. Integrand exp(−z2) in the complex z-plane.


The error function is odd:



Also, for any complex number z:



where z * is the complex conjugate of z.
The integrand ƒ = exp(−z2) and ƒ = erf(z) are shown in the complex z-plane in figures 2 and 3. Level of Im(ƒ) = 0 is shown with a thick green line. Negative integer values of Im(ƒ) are shown with thick red lines. Positive integer values of  are shown with thick blue lines. Intermediate levels of Im(ƒ) = constant are shown with thin green lines. Intermediate levels of Re(ƒ) = constant are shown with thin red lines for negative values and with thin blue lines for positive values.
At the real axis, the erf(z) approach unity at z → +∞ and −1 at z → −∞. At the imaginary axis, it tends to .

[edit] Taylor series




Fig.3. erf(z) in the complex z-plane.


The error function is an entire function; it has no singularities (except that at infinity) and its Taylor expansion always converges.
The defining integral cannot be evaluated in closed form in terms of elementary functions, but by expanding the integrand  into its Taylor series and integrating term by term, one obtains the error function's Taylor series as:



which holds for every complex number z. The denominator terms are sequence A007680 in the OEIS.
For iterative calculation of the above series, the following alternate formulation may be useful:



because  expresses the multiplier to turn the kth term into the (k + 1)th term (considering z as the first term).
The error function at +∞ is exactly 1 (see Gaussian integral).
The derivative of the error function follows immediately from its definition:



An antiderivative of the error function is




[edit] Inverse function
The inverse error function has series



where c0 = 1 and



So we have the series expansion (note that common factors have been canceled from numerators and denominators):

[1]

(After cancellation the numerator/denominator fractions are entries A092676/A132467 in the OEIS; without cancellation the numerator terms are given in entry A002067.)




Plot of the complementary error function


Note that error function's value at plus/minus infinity is equal to plus/minus 1.

[edit] Applications
When the results of a series of measurements are described by a normal distribution with standard deviation σ and expected value 0, then  is the probability that the error of a single measurement lies between −a and +a, for positive a.
The error and complementary error functions occur, for example, in solutions of the heat equation when boundary conditions are given by the Heaviside step function.
In digital optical communication system, BER is expressed by:



where μ1 and μ2 are expectation levels for bit zero and bit unity.

[edit] Asymptotic expansion
A useful asymptotic expansion of the complementary error function (and therefore also of the error function) for large x is



This series diverges for every finite x. However, in practice only the first few terms of this expansion are needed to obtain a good approximation of erfc(x), whereas the Taylor series given above converges very slowly.

[edit] Approximation with elementary functions
One approximation is given by



where



Such a fit gives at least one correct decimal digit of function erf in vicinity of the real axis.

[edit] Related functions
The error function is essentially identical to the standard normal cumulative distribution function, denoted Φ, as they differ only by scaling and translation. Indeed,



or rearranged for erf and erfc:



The inverse of  is known as the normal quantile function, or probit function and may be expressed in terms of the inverse error function as



The standard normal cdf is used more often in probability and statistics, and the error function is used more often in other branches of mathematics.
The error function is a special case of the Mittag-Leffler function, and can also be expressed as a confluent hypergeometric function (Kummer's function):



It has a simple expression in terms of the Fresnel integral. In terms of the Regularized Gamma function P and the incomplete gamma function,



 is the sign function.

[edit] Generalised error functions




Graph of generalised error functions En(x):
grey curve: E1(x) = (1 − e −x)/
red curve: E2(x) = erf(x)
green curve: E3(x)
blue curve: E4(x)
gold curve: E5(x).


Some authors discuss the more general functions



Notable cases are:

E0(x) is a straight line through the origin: 
E2(x) is the error function, erf(x).

After division by n!, all the En for odd n look similar (but not identical) to each other. Similarly, the En for even n look similar (but not identical) to each other after a simple division by n!. All generalised error functions for n > 0 look similar on the positive x side of the graph.
These generalised functions can equivalently be expressed for x > 0 using the Gamma function and incomplete Gamma function:



Therefore, we can define the error function in terms of the Gamma function:




[edit] Iterated integrals of the complementary error function
The iterated integrals of the complementary error function are defined by



They have the power series



from which follow the symmetry properties



and




[edit] Implementation
C/C++: It is provided by C99 as the functions double erf(double x) and double erfc(double x) in the header math.h or cmath. The pairs of functions {erff(),erfcf()} and {erfl(),erfcl()} take and return values of type float and long double respectively. GCC makes these functions available in C++ too.
Implementation of erf of complex argument is not so developed. In particular, calculation of figure 2 above takes several minutes at a middle-class computer with Mathematica software.
Fortran: E.g. gfortran provides the intrinsic real function ERF(X) and the double precision function DERF(X).
