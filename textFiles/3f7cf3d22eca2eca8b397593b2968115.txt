Current distribution of Human Language Families




This is a list of languages ordered by the number of native-language speakers with some data for second-language use. Languages are listed for secondary locations only when spoken by more than 1% of the population.
Since the definition of a single language is to some extent arbitrary, some mutually intelligible idioms with separate national standards or self-identification have been listed separately, depending on conventional use, including Scandinavian, Hindustani, Dutch and Afrikaans, Indonesian and Malay.
The relevant estimate for the number of native speakers for the purposes of this list is that of SIL Ethnologue. Other estimates may vary, and the numbers should not be taken as more than indicating the rough order of magnitude of a linguistic community.
