[edit] Overview
Parallels Plesk Control Panel allows a server administrator to set up new websites, e-mail accounts, and DNS entries through a web-based interface. The administrator can create client and site templates, which predetermine resource allocation parameters for the domains and/or clients.
Parallels Plesk Control Panel for Linux/UNIX supports multiple POSIX platforms, including Red Hat Linux/Fedora, SUSE, Debian/Ubuntu and FreeBSD. Parallels Plesk Control Panel for Windows supports Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 operating systems.
Parallels Plesk Control Panel installs custom versions of or manages versions of MySQL and PostgreSQL databases (Microsoft SQL server and Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine under Windows), Tomcat Java server, ColdFusion server, as well as CounterStrike and Battlefield 1942 game servers.

[edit] Add-ons
Parallels Plesk Control Panel has several software packs that are not part of the main Parallels Plesk Control Panel code base. These add-ons are designed to fully interact with Parallels Plesk Control Panel. These Parallels Plesk Control Panel software packs include functionality for billing, website building, and multiple server support.
They include:

Parallels Plesk Billing
Parallels Plesk Sitebuilder
Parallels Plesk Expand

[edit] Reported Issues

[edit] Security
Some users have complained that Plesk is not secure in the sense of multihosting security since all virtual hosts are run under the same Apache user and share the same configuration.[17] However, in Plesk 7.5.6 for Windows and onward, all virtual hosts can run under their own worker process group, secured using their own respective IIS user. In Plesk for Linux, they cannot. Plesk also defaults to port 8443 for https applications, this clashes with both Microsoft ISA servers and Microsoft Small Business Servers, which disallow non standard ports for https.

[edit] Backup and restore
One shortcoming in Plesk's data backup and restore functionality is the mechanism by which Plesk stores backup files, using server disk space before uploading files to a separate FTP server. Because Plesk backup files can be quite large, this mechanism effectively limits the usable server storage space, forcing administrators to choose between not backing up data or leaving large amounts of storage unused.
