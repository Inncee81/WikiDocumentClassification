This article includes a list of references or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations where appropriate. (February 2009)


Here are some of the more commonly known problems that are NP-complete when expressed as decision problems. This list is in no way comprehensive (there are more than 3000 known NP-complete problems). Most of the problems in this list are taken from Garey and Johnson's seminal book Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, and are here presented in the same order and organization.
This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
