From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The following is a list of 7400 series digital logic integrated circuits. The 7400 series originated with TTL integrated circuits made by Texas Instruments. Because of the popularity of these parts, they were second-sourced by other manufacturers who kept the 7400 sequence number as an aid to identification of compatible parts. As well, compatible TTL parts originated by other manufacturers were second sourced in the TI product line under a 74XXX series part number.
Parts are listed here as if made in the basic, standard power and speed, TTL form, although many later parts were never manufactured with that technology.

[edit] Notes
Some TTL logic parts were made with an extended military-specification temperature range. These parts are prefixed with 54 instead of 74 in the part number. A short-lived 64 prefix on Texas Instruments parts indicated an industrial temperature range; this prefix had been dropped from the TI literature by 1973. Most recent 7400 series parts are fabricated in CMOS or BiCMOS technology rather than TTL.
TTL parts made by manufacturers such as Signetics, Motorola, Mullard and Siemens may have different numeric prefix and numbering series entirely.
A few alphabetic characters to designate a specific logic subfamily may immediately follow the 74 or 54 in the part number, e.g., 74LS74 for Low-power Schottky. Some CMOS parts such as 74HCT74 for High-speed CMOS with TTL-compatible input thresholds are functionally similar to the TTL part. Not all functions are available in all families.
In a few instances, such as the 7478 and 74107, the same suffix in different families do not have completely equivalent logic functions.
There are a few numeric suffixes that have multiple conflicting assignments, such as the 74453.
Some manufacturers designate some 4000 equivalent CMOS circuits with a 74 prefix, for example 74HC4066. See list of 4000 series integrated circuits if you need to identify such parts.
