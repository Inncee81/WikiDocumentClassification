From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 

Free music can also mean free improvisation: improvised music without any rules, and not in any particular style.
For information on swapping of commercial music see File sharing, MP3-Xtreme, Napster or eMule.
For the WikiProject of this name, see WikiProject Free music.

Free music is music that, like free software, can freely be copied, distributed and modified for any purpose. Thus free music is either in the public domain, licensed under a free license or distributed by the artist themselves as a method of promotion. It does not mean that there should be no fee involved. The word free refers to freedom (as in free software), not to price.[1]
Some free music is licensed under licenses that are intended for software (like the GPL) or other written media (the GFDL). But there are also licenses especially for music and other works of art, such as EFF's Open Audio License, LinuxTag's Open Music License, the Free Art license and the Creative Commons Licences.
