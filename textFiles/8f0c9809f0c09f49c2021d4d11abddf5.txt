Look up -onym in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

The suffix –onym, in English, means "word, name," and words ending in –onym refer to a specified kind of name or word, most of which are classical compounds. For example, an acronym is a word formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term (as radar).
In some words, the -onym form has been modified by replacing (or dropping) the "o." In the examples ananym and metanym, the correct forms (anonym and metonym) were pre-occupied by other meanings. Other, late 20th century examples, such as hypernym and characternym, are typically incorrectly formed neologisms for which there are more traditional words formed in -onym (hyperonym and charactonym).
The English suffix -onym is from the Greek suffix –ώνυμον [-ōnumon], neuter of -ώνυμος (-ōnymos), having a specified kind of name, from the Greek ονομα [ónoma], Aeolic Greek ονυμα [ónuma, ónyma], "name." The form -ώνυμος (-ōnymos) is that taken by ονομα (ónoma, "name") when it is the end component of a bahuvrihi compound, but in English its use is extended to tatpurusa compounds.[dubious – discuss]
According to a 1988 study[1] of words ending in -onym:

There are four discernible classes of -onym words: (1) historic, classic, or, for want of better terms, naturally occurring or common words; (2) scientific terminology, particularly occurring in linguistics, onomastics, etc.; (3) language games; and (4) nonce words.


Older terms are known to gain new, sometimes contradictory, meanings (e.g., eponym and cryptonym). In many cases, two or more words describe the same phenomenon, but no precedence is discernable (e.g., necronym and penthonym). New words are sometimes created, unnecessarily, the meaning of which duplicate existing terms. Occasionally, new words are formed with little regard to historical principles.
