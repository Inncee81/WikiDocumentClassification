Structured wikis provide database-like manipulation of fields stored on pages, and usually offer an extraction and presentation language or markup with functionality somewhat similar to SQL.

[edit] Introduction
Wikis are typically used as shared whiteboards that allow users to add, remove, or otherwise edit all content very quickly and easily. The ease of interaction and operation makes a plain wiki an effective tool for collaborative writing and to share knowledge.
Database systems contain highly structured data, offer easy reporting, and can support workflows, but are not so well suited for collaboratively maintaining content.
A structured wiki combines the benefits of plain wikis and database systems. This results in a collaborative database environment where knowledge can be shared freely, and where structure can be added as needed. In a structured wiki, users can create wiki applications that are very specific to their needs, such as call center status boards, to-do lists, inventory systems, employee handbooks, bug trackers, blog applications and more.

[edit] Comparing plain wikis, database systems and structured wikis


Feature
Plain wikis
Database systems
Structured wikis


Content creation:
Collaborative, organic
Highly structured, predetermined format
Both (case by case)


Structure:
Simple: Hyperlinks, hierarchy of pages, page markup, categories
Tables, rows, relations
Both (case by case)


Reporting:
Fixed reports (recent changes etc)
Extensive reporting capabilities, also user generated reports
Both


Security:
Community based "soft security"
Access control
Both (case by case)


Application created by:
N/A
Programmers, database analysts (IT department)
End users ("Visual Basic paradigm shift")


Design methodology:
N/A
Top down "cathedral style"
Bottom up "bazaar style", user centric; iterative application development



[edit] Structured wiki engines

TWiki
Foswiki
XWiki
Trac, for the special case of ticketing, but flexible ticket types allow any content.
TikiWiki CMS/Groupware
PmWiki
BoltWire
Wagn lets users build up structure with cards of several types.

Semantic wiki: wiki combined with formal knowledge representation and querying (which are features of the Semantic Web concept)
Other wikis with simple database features that haven't been properly called structured wikis (or semantic wikis), but add categorization and database-like features to basic wiki engines:

MediaWiki categories
Dynamic Page List, a MediaWiki extension which allows the generation of lists from complex queries on categories, Wikipedia:namespaces, and/or articles (e.g., union, intersection).
OmegaWiki (formerly WiktionaryZ) builds a specialized database into MediaWiki
