[edit] Biography

[edit] Personal life
Born in Texas on May 30, 1981, Banhart's unusual first name was chosen by an Indian spiritual teacher whom his parents admired. When his parents divorced, Banhart and his mother relocated to Caracas, Venezuela, where he grew up (since he was 2 to 13 years old). After his mother remarried, Banhart moved again, this time to Los Angeles. He had been composing songs since his early teens, but never performed in public. Art, it seemed, was Banhart's true passion throughout childhood, and he won a scholarship to the prestigious San Francisco Art Institute to continue his studies. During his education, Banhart lived with a gay couple, whom he nicknamed Jerry Elvis and Bob the Crippled Comic. It was their faith in him that gave Banhart his first public performance–the couple's wedding.

[edit] Career
Banhart was "discovered" by Michael Gira of Swans, who released his Oh Me Oh My... and a few subsequent albums on his own Young God Records label beginning in 2002. In 2005, Banhart (along with Andy Cabic and Revolver USA) created Gnomonsong record label. In 2006 he helped to curate an edition of the British All Tomorrow's Parties festival.
Banhart is considered to have an eclectic style, with many of his songs seemingly following a stream-of-consciousness vein, being hard to decipher and non-literal. He gained some underground notoriety in New York City for performing several of his early shows with underwear on his head for the duration of the performance.
Banhart's most recent tour of the United States saw him perform with his full band, Power Mineral. The group included Andy Cabic (Vetiver), Greg Rogove (Priestbird), Noah Georgeson, Luckey Remington, Pete Newsom, Otto Hauser (Vetiver, Currituck Co., Espers, Nick Castro), Kevin Barker (Currituck Co.), and others. The band claims to rechristen itself when a name comes to them, and has previously been known as Fried Hummingbird, Vagina Burglars, Hairy Fairy Band, Las Putas Locas, Stoner Boner, Spiritual Boner, Bummer Hummer, Brain Taint, Love Fart and Bathhouse Of The Winds, among other names. Banhart and his bandmates have been known to unwind by playing pickup football or basketball games with their fans while on tour.
Banhart was the first artist to contribute a design for the Yellow Bird Project.
In 2007, Sacramento-born singer-songwriter Anton Barbeau included a song about Banhart on his album The Automatic Door called "Who's The Pony Now?", which mentions his name eleven times.
A collection of original artwork by Banhart was exhibited alongside the works of the late Swiss painter Paul Klee through February 24, 2008, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The show was titled "Abstract Rhythms".[citation needed]
Devendra had a brief cameo in the 2008 romantic comedy Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist. His song "Lover" is also featured in the movie and on its soundtrack CD.
According to the headline on his Myspace profile, Devendra has finished recording his new album and is in the mixing stage. [1]
