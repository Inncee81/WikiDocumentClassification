For other uses, see Software developer (disambiguation).
A software developer is a person or organization concerned with facets of the software development process wider than design and coding, a somewhat broader scope of computer programming or a specialty of project managing including some aspects of software product management. This person may contribute to the overview of the project on the application level rather than component level or individual programming tasks. Software developers are often still guided by lead programmers but also encompasses the class of freelance software developers.
Other names which are often used in the same close context are software analyst and software engineer.
With time and a little luck, differences between system design, software development and programming are more apparent. Already in the current market place there can be found a segregation between programmers and developers, being that one who actually implements is not the same as the one who designs the class structure or hierarchy. Even more so that developers become systems architects, those who design the multi-leveled architecture or component interactions of a large software system.[1] (see also Debate over who is a software engineer)
A 'programmer' is responsible for writing code,[1] but a 'developer' could be involved in wider aspects of the software development process such as:

Participation in software product definition, including Business case or Gap analysis
Specification
Requirements analysis
Development and refinement of throw-away simulations or prototypes to confirm requirements
Feasibility and Cost-benefit analysis, including the choice of application architecture and framework, leading to the budget and schedule for the project
Design
Implementation (e.g. installation, configuration, programming/customization, integration, data migration)
Authoring of documentation needed by users and implementation partners etc.
Testing, including defining/supporting acceptance testing and gathering feedback from pre-release testers
Participation in software release and post-release activities, including support for product launch evangelism (e.g. developing demonstrations and/or samples) and competitive analysis for subsequent product build/release cycles
Maintenance

In a large company there may be employees whose sole responsibility may consist of only one of the phases above. In smaller development environments, a few, or even a single individual might handle the complete process.

"A programmer is someone who does nothing but code new features and (if you're lucky) fix bugs. They don't write specs. They don't write automated test cases. They don't help keep the automated build system up to date. They don't help customers work out tough problems. They don't help write documentation. They don't help with testing. They don't even read code. All they do is write new code."
