[edit] Background
Nujabes's genre-blending music style is known for a distinct cool jazz and soul influence. He most typically uses samples from artists such as Miles Davis, Pat Metheny, and Yusef Lateef and adds live instrumentation, such as flutes, acoustic guitar, piano, and saxophone to create warm, mellow tracks. Despite his role as DJ, Nujabes rarely plays live and does not make many media appearances, which adds to his enigmatic charisma. This trait extends into his album covers, all of which express a particular distinct, abstract imagery. Nujabes has released two albums in Japan, Metaphorical Music in 2003 and Modal Soul in 2005. Specifically, Metaphorical Music sold over 20,000 copies by 2004, an unheard-of amount for an independent release.
After Tsutchie, Nujabes was the second artist Shinichirō Watanabe chose to contribute to the background music and soundtracks of Samurai Champloo, an anime which blends a feudal Japan setting with modern anachronisms, especially in regards to hip-hop culture.[1] In addition to Japanese artists like Uyama Hiroto, Shing02 and Minmi, Nujabes has collaborated with underground American hip-hop acts CYNE, Apani B, Five Deez, Substantial, CL Smooth, Terry Callier, as well as British rapper Funky DL. He is also a member of the production duo Urbanforest, an experimental collaboration with Nao Tokui.
