The phrase is a piece of subtitled dialogue from the introduction to Zero Wing.


"All your base are belong to us" (often shortened to "All Your Base", "AYBABTU", or simply "AYB") is a broken English phrase that sparked an Internet phenomenon, or meme, in 2001 and 2002, with the spread of a Flash animation that depicted the slogan. The text is taken from the opening cut scene of the European Sega Mega Drive version of Zero Wing,[1] a Japanese video game by Toaplan which was rushed in production and as a result was poorly translated into English. It was popularized by the Something Awful message forums.[2]

[edit] Game transcript


A summarized GIF animation of the scene.



In A.D. 2101
War was beginning.
Captain: What happen ?
Mechanic: Somebody set up us the bomb.
Operator: We get signal.
Captain: What !
Operator: Main screen turn on.
Captain: It's you !!
CATS: How are you gentlemen !!
CATS: All your base are belong to us.
CATS: You are on the way to destruction.
Captain: What you say !!
CATS: You have no chance to survive make your time.
CATS: Ha ha ha ha....
Operator: Captain !! *
Captain: Take off every 'ZIG'!!
Captain: You know what you doing.
Captain: Move 'ZIG'.
Captain: For great justice.

* This line and those following it are not in some animated GIF/Flash versions seen on the Internet. They may also be included within the song lyrics of the animated Flash movie.

[edit] Original Japanese text
It appears from the original text that CATS may be the name of an organization, not just of the particular cyborg villain appearing on the screen.[1]

西暦2101年
戦いは始まった。
艦長：一体どうしたと言んだ [sic]！
機関士：何者かによって、爆発物が仕掛けられたようです。
通信士：艦長！通信が入りました！
艦長：なにっ！
通信士：メインスクリーンにビジョンが来ます。
艦長：おっお前は！！
CATS：おいそがしそうだね、諸君。
CATS：連邦政府軍のご協力により、君達の基地は、全てCATSがいただいた。
CATS：君達の艦も、そろそろ終わりだろう。
艦長：ばっばかなっ・・・！
CATS：君達のご協力には感謝する。
CATS：せいぜい残り少ない命を、大切にしたまえ・・・・。
CATS：ハッハッハッハッハッ・・・
通信士：艦長・・・。
艦長：ZIG全機に発進命令！！
艦長：もう彼らに託すしかない・・。
艦長：我々の未来に希望を・・・
艦長：たのむぞ。ZIG！！

The phrase on U.S. Route 50 in Nevada



The phrase or some variation of lines from the game has appeared in articles, books, comics, clothing, movies, radio shows, songs, television shows, video games, webcomics, and websites.

In late 2000, Kansas City computer programmer and part-time DJ Jeffrey Ray Roberts, then aged 23, from the Gabber band The Laziest Men on Mars made a techno dance track, "Invasion of the Gabber Robots", which remixed some of the Zero Wing video game music by Tatsuya Uemura with a voiceover phrase "All your base are belong to us."[3]
On February 23, 2001, Wired provided an early report on the phenomenon, covering it from the Flash animation to its spread through e-mail and Internet forums to T-shirts bearing the phrase.[4]
On April 1, 2003, in Sturgis, Michigan, seven people aged 17 to 20 placed signs all over town that read, "All your base are belong to us. You have no chance to survive make your time." They claimed to be playing an April Fool's joke, but most people who saw the signs were unfamiliar with the phrase. Many residents were upset that the signs appeared while the U.S. was at war with Iraq, and police chief Eugene Alli said the signs could be "a borderline terrorist threat depending on what someone interprets it to mean."[5]
In February 2004, North Carolina State University students and members of The Wolf Web in Raleigh, North Carolina exploited a web-based service provided for local schools and businesses to report a weather-related closing to display the phrase within a news ticker on a live news broadcast on News 14 Carolina.[6]
On June 1, 2006, the video hosting website YouTube was taken down temporarily for maintenance. The phrase "ALL YOUR VIDEO ARE BELONG TO US" appeared below the YouTube logo as a placeholder while the site was down. Some users believed the site had been hacked, leading the host to add the message "No, we haven't been hacked. Get a sense of humor."[7]
On April 1, 2009, a variation of this phrase appeared on Google's CADIE joke site as, "All your web sites are belong to me." Another variation appeared within their April 1st, 2008 Virgle Mars Colony hoax, along with other Google's Hoaxes.
