[edit] Concept history
The concept of "success factors" was developed by D. Ronald Daniel of McKinsey & Company in 1961.[2] The process was refined by Jack F. Rockart in 1986.[3] In 1995 James A. Johnson and Michael Friesen applied it to many sector settings, including health care.[4]

[edit] Factors

[edit] Relation to Key Performance Indicator
A critical success factor is not a key performance indicator (KPI). Critical success factors are elements that are vital for a strategy to be successful. KPIs are measures that quantify management objectives and enable the measurement of strategic performance. A critical success factor is what drives the company forward, it is what makes the company or breaks the company. As staff must ask themselves everyday 'Why would customers choose us?' and they will find the answer is the critical success factors.
An example:

KPI = Number of new customers.
CSF = Installation of a call centre for providing quotations.
