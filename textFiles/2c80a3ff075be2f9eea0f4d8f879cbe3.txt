From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The first of the AFI 100 Years... series of cinematic milestones, AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies is a list of the 100 best American movies, as determined by the American Film Institute from a poll of more than 1,500 artists and leaders in the film industry who chose from a list of 400 nominated movies. The 100-best list was unveiled in 1998.
It was released in video in two versions: a 145-minute version, which aired on CBS, and a 460-minute version available only on video. It was hosted by Jodie Foster, among others. (However, the following note is found on the AFI website, "NOTE: Due to licensing restrictions, the telecasts of the AFI 100...100 Series are not available for distribution or purchase on DVD or VHS." This apparent discrepancy may result from unclear use of the the phrase "...released in video...", implying that the performance may be available for public purchase. AFI seems to clearly indicate this is not possible.)
An updated version of the list, billed as a 10th Anniversary edition, aired on CBS on June 20, 2007, and was hosted by Morgan Freeman.

[edit] Criticisms
As with the Academy Awards, the list of those who vote and the final vote tally is not released to the public.
On June 26, 1998, the Chicago Reader published an article by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum which offers a detailed response to the movies in the AFI list, as well as criticism, repeated elsewhere, of the AFI's appropriation of British films, such as Lawrence of Arabia and The Third Man. Rosenbaum also produced an alternate list of 100 American movies that he felt had been overlooked by the AFI.[1] Rosenbaum chose to present this alternative list alphabetically since to rank them according to merit would be "tantamount to ranking oranges over apples or declaring cherries superior to grapes." The AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list includes five titles from Rosenbaum's list, and the accompanying promotional poster lists the titles in alphabetical order.
Among other criticisms were that: more than half of the films were from years between 1950 to 1979 leaving the silent era and "modern era" virtually ignored. Critic Mick LaSalle accused the AFI of promoting "moronic consensus."[2]
