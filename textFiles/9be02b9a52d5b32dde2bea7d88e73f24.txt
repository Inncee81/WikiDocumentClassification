For the use of an Enneagram in relation to the teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff and his followers, see Fourth Way Enneagram.
In geometry, an enneagram is a nine-pointed geometric figure. The term derives from two ancient Greek words: ennea (nine) and gramma (something written).

[edit] Regular enneagrams
A regular enneagram (a nine-sided star polygon), is constructed using the same points as the regular enneagon but connected in fixed steps. It has two forms, represented by a Schläfli symbol as {9/2} and {9/4}, connecting every second and every fourth points respectively.
There is also a star figure, {9/3} or 3{3}, made from the regular enneagon points but connected as a compound of three equilateral triangles.[1][2] This last is sometimes also called a nonagram. This geometrical figure should not be confused with the logic puzzles called nonograms.

[edit] Other Enneagrams



The final stellation of the icosahedron has 2-isogonal enneagram faces. It is a {9/4} wound star polyhedron, but the vertices are not equally spaced.

The Enneagram of Personality and Fourth Way Enneagram use an irregular enneagram, constructed from a triangle and an irregular hexagram.

[edit] Use in popular culture

The heavy metal band, Slipknot, uses the |9/3| star figure nonagram as a symbol.
The nine-pointed star or nonagram symbolizes the Nine Fruits of the Spirit.
