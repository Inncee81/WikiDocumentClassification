[edit] Title
The series title has no particular significance to the story. "Azumanga" is a portmanteau of "Azuma" (the author's name) and "manga," while "Daioh" comes from the magazine in which it was originally published, Dengeki Daioh.[6] In the anime, "Daioh" is mentioned during the next episode previews, in context meaning "great king."
The name "Azumanga" is also used as a general term for Kiyohiko Azuma's other works (illustrations and comics).[7] The titles of two collections published in 1998 and 2001 containing official comics of Pioneer animations were Azumanga and Azumanga 2.[8][9] Azumanga was later republished in a reduced-size edition called Azumanga Recycle.[10]

[edit] Synopsis
Azumanga Daioh chronicles everyday life in an unnamed Japanese high school in Tokyo,[11] following the trials and triumphs of six girls: reserved Sakaki's obsession with cute animals, Chiyo's struggle to fit in with girls five years older, Osaka's spacey nature and skewed perspective on the world, Yomi's aggravation at an annoying best friend, Tomo, whose energy is rivaled only by her lack of sense, and Kagura's efforts in sports and school. The story covers three years of tests, culture festivals, and athletic events at school, after-school life at the nearby shopping district, at Chiyo's large house, vacations spent at Chiyo's summer home on the beach and at Magical Land, a theme park. It is generally realistic in tone, marked by occasional bursts of surrealism and absurdity, such as Osaka's bizarre imaginings, Chiyo's ponytails being "unscrewed", and an episode featuring the characters' New Year's dreams.
The manga and anime follow the same story line, though there are differences in small details.[12] Some jokes could not be dramatized as written and were either changed or excised completely. In the first manga volume, Osaka's appearance is noticeably different from in the anime and succeeding manga volumes. In the same vein, Sakaki's initial unapproachable demeanor in the manga is downplayed in the anime.

[edit] Characters
Main article: List of Azumanga Daioh characters
The main cast of Azumanga Daioh consists of six schoolgirls and two of their teachers. Secondary characters include Kimura-sensei, a creepy male teacher with an unhealthy obsession with teenage girls, and Kaorin, a classmate with a crush on Sakaki.




The main characters. From left to right: Sakaki, Kagura, Chiyo, Tomo, Yomi and Osaka



Chiyo Mihama
A child prodigy, also known as Chiyo-chan, who is considered amazingly cute by the other characters. Through her, the series humorously explores the consequences of skipping five grades to tenth grade (the first grade in Japanese high school). She is a target of jealousy due to her intelligence and wealthy family. Chiyo's twin ponytails were used in several visual gags in both the manga and anime, such as flying wings in Osaka's daydreams. Voiced by: Tomoko Kaneda (Japanese), Jessica Boone (English)


Tomo Takino
An extremely energetic and competitive girl, despite being nonathletic and a slacker. Tomo's character is extremely impulsive and rarely considers the consequences of anything. She is a selfproclaimed Lupin III fanatic.Voiced by: Chieko Higuchi (Japanese), Mandy Clark (English)


Koyomi "Yomi" Mizuhara
A grade-school friend and Tomo's general antagonist, Yomi as she is commonly known, is the title's voice of reason and straight man, carrying herself as the most mature and serious of the group. Though smart and athletic, she is constantly dissatisfied with herself due to her weight and is always trying various diets in an effort to become thinner. Voiced by: Rie Tanaka (Japanese), Nancy Novotny (English)


Sakaki
A tall, soft-spoken girl uncomfortable with her height and busty physique. Her reticence is misinterpreted as mysterious, or cool. She is naturally athletic but she has no real interest in sports. Sakaki is, in reality, an emotionally sensitive person who holds a secret longing for cute things. She loves cats, but the neighborhood cats dislike her and her parents do not allow cats in their house because her mother is allergic. She later finds an Iriomote Cat on their school field trip. When they leave Sakaki cries, but the cat follows her and Sakaki names the cat Maya. Chiyo later takes care of Maya for Sakai due to her mother's allergies. Voiced by: Yu Asakawa (Japanese), Christine Auten (English)


Ayumu "Osaka" Kasuga
More popularly known by her nickname Osaka (大阪 ,Ōsaka?), Ayumu is a transfer student from Osaka. Tomo quickly chose for her the nickname "Osaka" contrary to Ayumu's behavior, which is different from what Tomo sees as the "typical" Osakan. Ayumu lacks the energy or motivation to dispute the nickname. She has a mind that works differently than other people, prone to daydreaming, absentmindedness, and non-sequiturs, but exceptional at answering very specific types of riddles. Voiced by: Yuki Matsuoka (Japanese), Kira Vincent-Davis (English)


Kagura
A girl who joins Yukari's class in the second year. Yukari selects her as a ringer to win the school athletic competitions. Originally in Nyamo's class and with little success in studies, she devotes her time to the swim team but is an all-around good athlete. She is genuinely nice to her classmates but is competitive and has a slight obsession with Sakaki, with whom she sees as an athletic rival due to Sakaki being a naturally gifted athlete with no training at all. She is also sensitive and prone to tears when she doesn't perform as well as she wants to, or at the thought of parting with her friends. Voiced by: Houko Kuwashima (Japanese), Allison Sumrall (English)


Yukari Tanizaki
The girls' English and homeroom teacher (class 3), with very unconventional methods and a close relationship with the class. Her students are casual enough to call her by her first name: Yukari-sensei, and even use the very informal and intimate name and title of Yukari-chan. She can be moody and, like Tomo, is incredibly impulsive and has a tendency not to think things through. Yukari has a rivalry/friendship with Minamo and attempts to prove that she is the superior teacher. Yukari is known for being an absolutely horrible driver with a car beaten entirely with dents. Yukari's driving skills are responsible for Chiyo-chan developing an occasional phobia to riding in cars. Voiced by: Akiko Hiramatsu (Japanese), Luci Christian (English)


Minamo "Nyamo" Kurosawa
A gym teacher at the girls' school. In the girls' first year of high school, she was the homeroom teacher of class 5. During their last two years, she was the homeroom teacher of class 2. She is an old high school friend and rival of Yukari, who occasionally refers to her by an old nickname of Nyamo (にゃも ,Nyamo?), despite Minamo's wishes to the contrary. Popular with the students, Minamo is nicer and in greater control of herself than Yukari, but, in moments of weakness, Minamo has proven that she can be just as vulnerable to losing control as is Yukari. She likes to gossip about Yukari to the students, but doesn't do so because Yukari has blackmail material on Minamo from back when they were students. Voiced by: Aya Hisakawa (Japanese), Monica Rial (English)

[edit] Anime
Main article: List of Azumanga Daioh episodes
The television anime, Azumanga Daioh: the Animation, was produced by J.C.Staff and aired from April 8, 2002 until September 30, 2002.[3] It was broadcast on TV Tokyo, TV Aichi, TV Osaka, and AT-X in five-minute segments every weekday,[4] then repeated as a 25-minute compilation that weekend, for a total of 130 five-minute segments collected in 26 episodes. The compilation episodes, which were the only versions to include the title and credits sequences, were released on VHS and DVD by Starchild Records;[5] the five-minute segments can be distinguished by their individual titles.
Besides the television anime, there have been two other animated adaptations: The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie, a six minute trailer released to movie theatres to publicize the upcoming television series, and Azumanga Web Daioh, a shorter pilot episode that appeared on the official Japanese Azumanga Daioh website for a limited time.[15] Azumanga Web Daioh was originally intended to gauge whether there was enough interest to create a web-released anime adaptation; because of overwhelming demand, the original plan for web-release was changed to a television release. As a pilot, it featured different voice actors and music from the regular series.
In the United States, the television anime was released in a six DVD volume set September 9, 2005 and then later in a five DVD volume "Thinpak" set, both by ADV Films.[16] The sixth DVD volume included The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie. Of the three soundtrack albums released in Japan ("Original Soundtrack" Vol 1 and 2, collecting the show's score and themes, and "Vocal Collection", collecting the image songs sung by the characters themselves), Vol 1 and the Vocal Collection were released in the United States by Geneon.[17]

[edit] Live action hoax
After the animated series ended, there was a hoax announcement of a live-action adaptation, as being created by the Tokyo Broadcasting System and Suntory and which would be named either Azudorama Da Yo! or Azumanga Daioh: The Drama. Professional-looking promotional material and photos were prepared and presented on the internet with "actresses" who closely resembled their animated counterparts.[18]

[edit] Video games

[edit] Official
There is an Azumanga Daioh PlayStation video game, Azumanga Donjyara Daioh, which is a puzzle game similar to mahjong.[19]
Azumanga Daioh Advance was released for the Game Boy Advance,[19] taking the form of a simplistic collectible card game (or CCG). The idea was to arrange five-card hands into an order that maximised the number of lines of three stars or more, either horizontally or diagonally. The eight main characters (the six girls, Yukari and Nyamo) were playable, the two teachers being unlockable. Secondary characters, such as Mayaa, Tadakichi-san, Kami-neko, Kaorin, Kimura-sensei and even Neko-Koneko (if the latter can be called a character), appeared if good hand scores were achieved. Chiyo-chichi appeared as a 5-second warning.
Azumanga Puzzle Daioh, an arcade-only Puzzle Bobble spin-off was produced.[19] As well as featuring characters, graphics and sound-bytes from the series, the 2-player mode allowed each player to fire balls into the other player's arena, a feature not present in any other official Puzzle Bobble game.

[edit] Unofficial
Several Azumanga Daioh dōjin soft games exist. One is a Japanese PC game called Ah, Let's Fight (あ、対戦しよ~ ,A, Taisen Shiyo?), modeled after the popular Street Fighter series, is entirely produced by a third party.[20] Single player game mode, single player vs chosen character, two-player, and practice modes are available playing options. A sequel called A, Taisen Shiyo: Come Back was created a year later and featured more playable characters. There is also a game/simulator/screensaver called Kasuga Ayumu Mail-Order Life[21].

[edit] Reception
In Japan, the Azumanga Daioh manga received a Jury Recommendation during the sixth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2002.[22]
English reviewers have commented positively about Azumanga Daioh. Fred Patton of Animation World Magazine, has described Azumanga Daioh as "delightfully witty and even an educational window onto what Japanese high school life is really like."[23] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that "There's a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don't."[24] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is just so much meaning, and charm, in even the most minor of expressions."[25] The licensed manga had sales that reached top 100 lists on occasions and was included in the top 25 manga recommended by International Correspondence in Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga.[26][27] The English dub for the show was well received, earning 6 ADR Awards from fans voting on AnimeonDVD.com and Dubreview.com. Volumes 3, 4 and 6 won "Best Dub of the Month" and Allison Sumrall (Kagura), Kira Vincent-Davis (Osaka) and Christine Auten (Sakaki) won individual "Best Actress of the Month" awards.[citation needed]
Four of the girls were included in Newtype Magazine's top 100 anime heroines of 2002: Osaka was awarded 7th, Chiyo 11th, Sakaki 21st, and Yomi 78th. Together they made Azumanga Daioh the second most popular series of 2002 for female characters.[28]
Marc Hairston describes Azumanga Daioh as being "slightly disjointed", with "frequently oblique" and "culturally biased" humour, and says it is both "lighter" and "more wry" than Maria-sama ga Miteru. He describes the characters of Azumanga as being "individuals with slightly offbeat personalities".[29]
