From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Declarative memory is the aspect of human memory that stores facts. It is so called because it refers to memories that can be consciously discussed, or declared. It applies to standard textbook learning and knowledge, as well as memories that can be 'travelled back to' in one's 'mind's eye'. It is contrasted with procedural memory, which applies to skills. Declarative memory is subject to forgetting, but frequently-accessed memories can last indefinitely. Declarative memories are best established by using active recall combined with mnemonic techniques and spaced repetition.[1]

[edit] Types of declarative memory
There are two types of declarative:

Semantic memory
Theoretical knowledge independent of time and place (e.g. knowing that an apple is called by society to be a "fruit"), a piece of data.
Episodic memory
Factual knowledge of a specific moment in time and place, personal experiences

Some people believe that episodic memory and semantic memory are really just one type of memory. However, most believe they are quite different, and indeed distinct. [2]

[edit] Neuropsychology
Physically speaking, declarative memory requires the medial temporal lobe, especially the hippocampus and related areas of the cerebral cortex. The famous amnesiac H.M. had a great deal of his medial temporal lobes removed and had a primarily declarative impairment (specifically, his episodic memory).
