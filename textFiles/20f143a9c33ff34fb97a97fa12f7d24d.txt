Adobe Creative Suite (CS) is a collection of graphic design, video editing, and web development applications made by Adobe Systems. The collection consists of Adobe's applications (e.g., Photoshop, Acrobat, InDesign), that are based on various technologies (e.g., PostScript, PDF, Flash). The latest version, Adobe Creative Suite 4 (CS4), was announced on September 23, 2008 as the successor to Adobe Creative Suite 3. It was officially released on October 15, 2008.[1] 30-day trials for all products except those in Japanese should be available.[2]
Adobe sells Creative Suite applications in six different combinations called "editions".

[edit] New in Creative Suite 4




Icons of the core CS4 programs lined up. The colors of the icons are reflected in each program's box. Also, the boxes of the different editions are colored according to the programs they include


All applications in CS4 feature the same user interface, with a new tabbed interface for working with concurrently running Adobe CS4 programs where multiple applications can be opened inside multiple tabs contained in a single window.[3] It was announced that nVidia CUDA technology is now available via 3rd party plugins which will accelerate H.264 video encoding.
Adobe CS4 is also developed to perform better under 64-bit and multi-core processors. Adobe Photoshop CS4 runs natively as a 64-bit application. Adobe After Effects CS4 and Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 has been optimized for 64-bit operating system although they are not natively 64-bit.[4] However, Adobe CS4 64-bit will not be available for Mac OS X.[5] In early testing of 64-bit support in Adobe Photoshop CS4, overall performance gains ranged from 8% to 12%. Those who work with extremely large files may realize noticeably greater gains in performance, in some cases as dramatic as ten times the previous speed. This is because 64-bit applications can address larger amounts of memory and thus result in less file swapping — one of the biggest factors that can affect data processing speed.[6]

[edit] Applications
Brief descriptions of the applications in the various Adobe Creative Suite editions:

Adobe Acrobat is a software family dedicated to Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF):

Adobe Acrobat Standard and Adobe Acrobat Professional, which allows the creation of PDF files
Adobe Reader, a free (closed source) software application which allows the reading of PDF files


Adobe After Effects is a digital motion graphics and compositing software published by Adobe Systems. It can be used in film and video post-production.
Adobe Bridge is an organizational program. Its primary purpose is to link the parts of the Creative Suite together using a format similar to the file browser found in previous versions of Adobe Photoshop.
Adobe Contribute is for editing the content of a website. It allows a wide variety of people within an organization to update web pages by reducing the amount of web design skills necessary for the process.
Adobe Device Central's primary purpose is to integrate parts of the Creative Suite together to offer both professional and individual creative professionals, web designers, and mobile developers an easier way to preview and test Flash Lite, bitmap, web, and video content for mobile devices.
Adobe Dreamweaver is a combination code / GUI web development application.
Adobe Dynamic Link integrates After Effects with Premiere Pro and with Encore.
Adobe Encore is a DVD authoring software tool produced by Adobe Systems and targeted at semi-professional video producers. Files are automatically transcoded to MPEG-2 video and Dolby Digital audio. DVD menus can be created and edited in Adobe Photoshop using special layering techniques.
Adobe Fireworks is a bitmap and vector graphics editor, aimed at web designers (with features such as: slices, the ability to add hotspots etc.).
Adobe Flash is a software family dedicated to various Adobe multimedia technologies:

Adobe Flash Professional, a multimedia authoring program used to create web applications, games, movies, and content for mobile phones and other embedded devices. It features support for vector and raster graphics, a scripting language called ActionScript and bi-directional streaming of audio and video.
Adobe Flash Player, a free software application which allows the playing of standalone Adobe Flash (SWF) multimedia files.


Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor.
Adobe InDesign is a desktop publishing (DTP) software application.
Adobe OnLocation is a direct-to-disk recording and monitoring software.
Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor (with significant vector graphics functionality).
Adobe Premiere Pro is a real-time, timeline based video editing software application.
Adobe Soundbooth is a digital audio editor. Adobe has described it as being "in the spirit of Sound Edit 16 and Cool Edit 2000". Soundbooth is not replacing Adobe Audition, rather creating a product for creative professionals who do not specialize in audio.
Adobe Version Cue enables users to easily track and manipulate file metadata, which is information about the history of computer files, such as the fact that one file is a new version of a related older file. Version Cue also automates the process of collaboratively reviewing documents among groups of people.

Adobe Creative Suite 3 (CS3) was announced on March 27, 2007; it introduced universal binaries for all major programs for the Apple Macintosh.[7] Some Creative Suite programs also began using the Presto layout engine used in the Opera web browser[8].
Adobe began selling CS3 applications in six different combinations called "editions." These editions were the same as those released for CS4. Design Standard & Premium and Web Standard & Premium began shipping on April 16, 2007, and Production Premium and Master Collection editions began shipping on July 2, 2007. The latest released CS3 version was version 3.3, released on June 2, 2008. In this version Fireworks CS3 was included in Design Premium and all editions that included Acrobat 8 Pro had been replaced with Acrobat 9 Pro. [9] Below is a matrix of the applications included in each edition of CS3 version 3.3:

[edit] Production Studio
Adobe Creative Suite Production Studio (previously Adobe Video Collection) was a suite of programs for acquiring, editing, and distributing digital video and audio. The suite was available in standard and premium editions.
The Adobe Production Studio Premium edition consisted of:

Since CS3, Adobe Production Studio became part of the Creative Suite family. The equivalent version for Production Studio Premium is the Adobe Creative Suite Production Premium.

[edit] Macromedia Studio
Macromedia Studio was a suite of programs designed for web content creation designed and distributed by Macromedia. After Adobe’s acquisition of Macromedia, Macromedia Studio 8 was replaced, modified, and integrated into two editions of the Adobe Creative Suite family of software. The closest relatives of Macromedia Studio 8 are now called Adobe Creative Suite Web Premium and Web Standard.
Core applications from Macromedia Studio have been merged with Adobe Creative Suite since CS3, including Flash, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks. Some Macromedia applications were absorbed into existing Adobe products, e.g. FreeHand has been replaced with Adobe Illustrator. Director and ColdFusion are not part of Adobe Creative Suite and will only be available as standalone products. Four recent versions of Macromedia Studio released include:

Macromedia Studio MX Released 29 May 2002, internally it was version 6 and the first incarnation of the studio to use the "MX" suffix, which for marketing purposes was a shorthand abbreviation that meant "Maximize". Studio MX included Dreamweaver, Flash, FreeHand, Fireworks and a developer edition of ColdFusion.
Macromedia Studio MX Plus Released 10 February 2003, sometimes referred to as MX 1.1. MX plus was a special edition release of MX that include Freehand MX (replacing Freehand 10), Contribute and DevNet Resource Kit Special Edition in addition to the existing MX suite of products.
Macromedia Studio MX 2004 Released 10 September 2003, despite its name, it is internally version 7. Studio MX 2004 included FreeHand along with updated versions of Dreamweaver, Flash and Fireworks. An alternate version of Studio MX 2004 included Flash Professional.
Macromedia Studio 8 Released 13 September 2005, Studio 8 was the last version of Macromedia Studio. It comprised Dreamweaver 8, Flash 8, Flash 8 Video Converter, Fireworks 8, Contribute 3 and FlashPaper.
